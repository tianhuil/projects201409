Buried is a one of a kind experience that goes well beyond just a movie with a neat idea. It's a thriller that really works and is one of the best films I've seen all year.:::1:::8/10
A nifty gimmick rarely translates into satisfying cinema, but Buried qualifies as an exception.:::1:::None
Remind yourself to breathe.:::1:::3/4
With little more than one actor, a mobile phone, a (very full) Zippo and a few disembodied voices, director Rodrigo Cortes has created a 95-minute panic-attack-made-movie.:::1:::4/5
Reynolds and Cortes deserve credit for their ambition and Buried is a tense but enjoyable experience for anyone interested in the core 'buried alive' concept.:::1:::4/5
Director Rodrigo Cortes continually achieves the seemingly impossible.:::1:::3/4
(...) Como ejercicio narrativo bastante claustrofobico y moderadamente angustiante, tiene su atractivo. Gran parte del resultado es merito del actor Ryan Reynolds.:::0:::2/5
A brilliant genre thriller using space and perspective to confine us with the protagonist.:::1:::4/4
This experiment in minimalist filmmaking succeeds in part because of the tight, controlled performance by one of People magazine's sexiest men (buried) alive!:::1:::3/4
Conveys the intensity and introspective horror of its subject's extreme life-or-death circumstances far more authentically and grippingly than the similar, flashier and shallower 127 Hours.:::1:::B
Buried may well be an allegory for the fates of so many Americans waylaid in sandier climes, but it works first and foremost as an experiential horror film -- the best of its kind in some time.:::1:::4/5
Reynolds is riveting, and it's possible to appreciate Cortes's bravura cinematic accomplishment. But that'll come much later, after you catch your breath.:::1:::4/5
It's kind of like if Saw were a one-man show in a tiny theater.:::1:::3/5
While its central conceit - its six-feet-under micro-location - might seem gimmicky, it's a gimmick that would get real tired real quick if not for an exceptional script and one hell of a performance.:::1:::5/5
Rodrigo Cortes's film is rigidly grim and relentlessly discomforting - thanks to superior sound design, creatively claustrophobic camerawork and a one-man-show from Ryan Reynolds, who leaves no room for sarcasm in this sarcophagus.:::1:::3.5/4
The genius of this film is that it never once betrays its concept.:::1:::4/5
Buried may be claustrophobic in scale, but its impact is immense.:::1:::4/4
Buried, despite its seemingly impossible premise, is by turns funny, suspenseful, moving and -- in one heart-stopping sequence worthy of Indiana Jones -- incredibly exciting.:::1:::3/4
An edge-of-your-seat nail-biter that's about as unique as they come.:::1:::3.5/5
If the aim is to be unpredictable and to revel in cynicism, you run the risk -- realized here -- that the movie becomes more an authorial statement of purpose than a story the audience can believe in.:::0:::None

Playing a character buried underneath the ground, Ryan Reynolds reveals that when it comes to acting he's all surface and no depth.:::0:::None
Director Rodrigo Cortes' creative use of total darkness and anxiety-inducing sound effects should inspire budget-challenged nightmare makers everywhere.:::1:::3.5/5
Buried achieves the rare feat of being both deliriously enjoyable and relentlessly unpleasant. The film -- a furious fusion of Phone Booth, Wait Until Dark, 1408 and Cube -- is a ninety-minute test of endurance.:::1:::4/5
Buried works not because Ryan Reynolds is good (he is) but because director Rodrigo Cortes is even better.:::1:::4/5
... a clever topical adaptation of the old Lucille Fletcher radio drama (and Barbara Stanwyck movie) Sorry, Wrong Number ...:::1:::3/5
The sensation of confinement is so powerful that after a while I had an overwhelming urge to try and claw my way out through the side of the cinema.:::1:::3.5/5
Whoever says you need to think outside the box should think again, because Buried is nothing short of a minimalist masterpiece.:::1:::4.5/5
A triumph of filmmaking design, as well as fierce thriller sure to give viewers a serious case of the heebie-jeebies.:::1:::B+
Reynolds? portrayal of this Everyman, a guy doing his job in the wrong place at the wrong time, is sympathetic and intensely watchable from the first moment to the last.:::1:::3.5/4
Whatever the reasons that draw us to the movies, spending 90 minutes trapped in a box with Ryan Reynolds isn't one of them.:::0:::None
Sometimes the best ideas are the simplest, although filmmakers seldom think so. Rodrigo Cortes is an exception, with his feature film debut Buried breaking a lot of rules.:::1:::B
Somewhere, Edgar Allan Poe is uncorking a bottle of Amontillado and laughing himself silly.:::1:::3.5/5
Set in Iraq, Buried takes aim at the American industrial military complex and manages to be both a cerebral experience and a perverse, visceral delight.:::1:::None
Sometimes Cortes gets carried away with his "angry little film criticizing the world", but hell, when you?re stuck making a movie in a box, it?s easy to see why you?d want to stand up, raise your arms and yell as loud as possible.:::1:::85/100
Best ending of the year.:::1:::4/4
There?s just not enough material here to sustain a 90-minute movie.:::0:::2.5/5
Reynolds' efforts transform what could have been a chilly technical exercise into something darkly comic, unexpectedly moving, and, above all, hot-plate skittery. You will squirm.:::1:::None
Cortes similarly crafts a heightened sense of awareness out of the less-is-more scenario. The result is a skillful thriller with a strong point of view that is also confident in its use of genre flourishes.:::1:::3.5/4
This is as un-Hollywood a role as you could ever get, but [Reynolds] nails both the compressed physicality and fried psyche of his character with palpable precision.:::1:::3.5/5
Highlighting the talent and inventiveness of all involved, Buried is gripping and entertaining, making it perfect cinema viewing.:::1:::None
Skillfully directed, shrewdly written, darkly funny, classically scored and acted right the f**k out of the park by a star not known for his dramatic chops.:::1:::None
Reynolds is an irrepressibly (some might say irritatingly) verbal actor, so there?s something both genius and obscene about subjecting him to solitary confinement by cinema.:::1:::4/5
Rodrigo Cortes directs and Chris Sparling wrote the screenplay. They and Reynolds should be applauded. But you wonder who on earth is going to submit themselves to a film that is set exclusively in a coffin.:::1:::3/5
All film-making is a manipulative art; Buried is just too overtly so.:::0:::3/5
Whether you like it or not, Buried is a film that will stick in your memory.:::1:::A-
It's too long, it loses all sense of direction at the 60 minute mark, and so much of the action is phone-based that after a while it starts to feel like an audiobook.:::0:::6/10
[A] grueling experience... and a thrilling one: We so rarely see movies this adventurous, this creative with their narratives and their plotting and their characters.:::1:::None
Buried is also one of the most visually inventive, deftly edited films of the year.:::1:::None
The hero of the hour is Reynolds, who gives a hugely compelling performance mostly lying on his back. His spine probably deserves its own Oscar for sheer endurance.:::1:::None
If you think you're brave enough, and even if you aren't, Buried demands to be experienced on the big screen in all its suffocating, claustrophobic glory.:::1:::None
Driven by Ryan Reynolds magnificent performance, this tense and ambitious film is absolutely riveting to watch unfold.:::1:::None
The tension keeps building, right to the end. Proving yet again that in movies, even though the space may get smaller, the picture doesn't have to.:::1:::3/4
A part of me feels like why waste Ryan Reynolds and his hot abs in a film where he?s buried six feet under but another part of me loves how Buried flips off audiences by using a Hollywood celebrity in a manner that will only piss them off.:::1:::5/10
One must at a minimum concede that Buried boasts an elegant premise of inordinate simplicity.:::1:::9/10
This is an extremely well crafted film that will keep you on the edge of your seat right up to the very last shot.:::1:::4/5
The skilful screenplay by Chris Sparling maintains the suspense right up to the will-he or wont-he get out ending, while slipping in some welcome black humour and a quietly effective message about state and corporate ruthlessness.:::1:::4/5
Buried is one of those movies that make a virtue of their limitations.:::1:::4/5
a riveting production that's undeniably disturbing and a unique moviegoing experience.:::1:::B
There's something faintly quixotic about a filmmaker who, faced with technical limitations in a script, chooses to embrace them rather than fight them. Such is the case with Buried, an uncompromising suspense thriller from Spanish director Rodrigo Cortes.:::1:::3/5
One of the film's great strengths is that Sparling's script doesn't pull any punches with the scenario.:::1:::8/10
Reynolds and Cortes have to make you believe that you're stuck in that box too, to make you feel, somewhere in your subconscious, that your quickened respirations are going to use up the air around you; and that's just what they manage to do.:::1:::8.2/10
As for Reynolds' performance -- just be prepared to be pleasantly surprised. Amazed, even. In Buried he may finally have found a project as good as he is.:::1:::None
Not recommended for claustrophobics. It's more or less a smothering experience.:::1:::None
Who would have thought that Ryan Reynolds talking on a cell phone in a wooden box could be so damn thrilling?:::1:::3.5/5
Buried is a brutal, relentless, mind-numbing thriller whose last five minutes will leave you absolutely breathless.:::1:::3.5/5
A tightly woven and effective thriller. (Parental Review also Available):::1:::None
You don't have to be claustrophobic to find the entire enterprise thoroughly upsetting.:::1:::4/4
Buried wrings every last drop of tension from a simple dramatic set-up.:::1:::None
The suspense is gripping, even when the substance isn't.:::1:::3/4
Watching Ryan Reynolds trapped in a coffin for an hour-and-a-half makes for the most intense piece of cinema this year.:::1:::4/4
An experiment in limitation that, at least until the movie's deflating final payoff, manages to tap into our deepest anxieties.:::1:::2.5/4
Bravura filmmaking, certainly, Buried borrows techniques from great inventive filmmakers (director Rodrigo Cortes cites Hitchcock, Scorsese and Spielberg in his notes) but applies them to a claustrophobic horror story that drags us into a place of terror:::1:::None
"Buried" is a film that gave me claustrophobia and made me want to getback the money I had not spent on the ticket.:::1:::D
If the picture has replay value, it will be to study the technically pretty astounding filmmaking going on, not because it's a journey one would necessarily like to go on again.:::1:::2.5/4
By the end, I was quietly wheezing and whinnying with distress.:::1:::4/5
It may sound like a gimmicky premise, but Buried is as far outside the box as a buried-alive movie can be.:::1:::3/4
Buried would make an awesome double bill alongside Inception, as opposite ends of the clever, concept-movie spectrum.:::1:::B
At its best, Buried is a filmmaker's fondest double-dare challenge. And at its very best, it's considerably more.:::1:::3/4
Reynolds's default has always been a sarcasm that's locked him out of seeming entirely human. In Buried, he's neutralized.:::0:::2/4
A brutally intense indie that commits to its bleak premise and doesn't back down. Tarantino will cackle as he watches.:::1:::4/5
Compulsive entertainment with an intelligent script that knows exactly how to maximise its cat-and-mouse tensions, slyly inviting us to appreciate and anticipate the inventive contributions of the cat quite as much as the mouse.:::1:::3.5/5
This is a solid, unsettling, at times very entertaining thriller -- but the jury's still out on Reynolds.:::1:::3/5
It's a watchable enough film, if you can overlook all the holes in the plot.:::1:::3/5
It's definitely possible to quibble about the sheer ridiculousness of Conroy's situation a day or so down the line, but while you're watching it you'll be too busy hiding behind your shirt and nibbling on your collar to even think that far ahead.:::1:::4/5
Plausibility sits cowed in a corner. It says, "Don't look at me. I have nothing to do with this.":::1:::3/5
Reynolds delivers a relentlessly effective performance. So it's a shame that it's not more involving than it is.:::0:::2.5/5
Buried grabs the viewer and rarely lets its hold slip, playing on our universal fears with great skill.:::1:::4/5
Always confident but rarely stretched, Reynolds finally gets the chance to prove his dramatic chops as Paul runs the gauntlet of human emotion: confusion, fear, anger, hysteria, hope, sorrow, despair.:::1:::4/5
Buried does do a hell of a lot with very little. Through clever camerawork, it's surprising how much action and tension can be built.:::1:::4/5
Buried is completely and utterly, 100 percent dedicated to bringing you all the Ryan-Reynolds-nailed-in-a-coffin action you could ever ask for.:::1:::4/5
What starts out as a claustrophobic and suspenseful allegory about the folly of the Iraq War settles into a series of pseudo-ironic twists and a conclusion that will leave you gasping for air.:::0:::2/4
Impressively directed and superbly written, this is a genuinely suspenseful, emotionally engaging thriller with a terrific performance from Ryan Reynolds.:::1:::4/5
the confines of a coffin become a landscape rife with every element that constitutes the most effective and most engrossing thriller, with all the visual turbulence of an action film played out in a space barely a foot high.:::1:::5/5
Ninety minutes of being buried alive with Ryan Reynolds: Didn't we all suffer that in The Proposal?:::0:::2/4
Ends up more an exercise in bare-bones cinema than a penetrating drama, and though it's been executively efficiently, it fails to be emotionally compelling.:::0:::C+
A bratty but canny thriller that takes a very simple premise and runs much farther with it than any right-minded director should have been able to.:::1:::2.5/4
This should really have been made for radio rather than cinema - although the performance from Ryan Reynolds keeps you riveted to see what happens.:::1:::3/5
A relentlessly terrifying, pulse-pounding and intelligent thriller. Ryan Reynolds gives his best performance yet. It's the most intense movie-going experience in years.:::1:::9.74/10
Claustrophobes and asthmatics be warned: Buried unfolds entirely within the confines of a coffin, where an increasingly desperate man faces certain death by suffocation unless he can escape.:::1:::None
...plays like a Twilight Zone episode padded out to feature length.:::0:::C+
Buried is remarkably cinematic, and the confined space opens up in ways you wouldn't think possible.:::1:::None
With career-best work from Ryan Reynolds, Buried will find a loyal, devoted audience.:::1:::None
It's a very, very good film, but it's difficult to recommend.:::1:::4/5
Talk about burying the lead. . .:::1:::5/5
Either Mr. Reynolds was directed to rant and rave, or his bellowing tantrums are meant to signal that Paul is a childish fool who isn't very bright.:::0:::2.5/5
At times so uncomfortable you'll want to look away, Reynolds' performance -- essentially a one-man show -- keeps you coming back for more.:::1:::B+
In the same way it's impossible to turn away from a grisly accident, taking your eyes away from Ryan Reynolds' hypnotizing performance is not an option.:::1:::3.5/4
On a technical level Buried is impressive, at times blisteringly suspenseful, making the most of a ripping score and Reynolds' fully charged agony...:::1:::2.5/4
The filmmaking is sharp.:::1:::B+
Watching his movie, we feel distinctly the absence of a safety net -- anything can happen. Which will drive some audiences crazy, but which delighted me.:::1:::B+
I think they could have taken it to the next level. Buried is certainly good and worth watching, but it could have been the definitive high concept movie. Instead it's just one that doesn't suck:::1:::None
Chalk Buried firmly into the 'terrific movies I never want to see again' category.:::1:::A-
Cleverly written and staged with plenty of wound-up energy, plus a climax that sucks the air out of the theater.:::1:::B+
Paul's life is treated as a novelty. Out there in the audience, we're treated as suckers.:::0:::4.5/10
Reynolds is terrific, and Cortes and Sparling overlay a preposterous premise with familiar modern complaints.:::1:::B
As a cautionary tale about the perils of nation building, this is both creepy and provocative, but director Rodrigo Cortes blows it in the last few minutes with a rushed ending that feels like a cheat after all the escalating tension.:::0:::None
This film's opening alone is more terrifying than the entirety of most horror movies.:::1:::3/5
Pulls the tricky stunt off with flair, constantly finding new ways to keep the audience on their toes and invested in Paul's dilemma.:::1:::4/5
An intense, claustrophobic experience that's inventively filmed and powerfully performed by Reynolds as the story's flawed but unnecessarily hard-done-by everyman.:::1:::4/5
Too often revolves around the battery life of a cell phone and the amount of air remaining. That threat is terrifying in our mind but difficult to see on screen.:::0:::3/5
This is shrewdly considered and edited genre work, spiced -- bitterly -- with the right variety of complication.:::1:::3.5/4
Although the entire movie takes place in the enclosed space, director Rodrigo Cortes and writer Chris Sparling are ingenious in creating more plausible action than you would expect possible.:::1:::3.5/4
Rodrigo Cortes, the Spanish filmmaker behind this diabolical, Hitchcock-influenced narrative stunt, makes merry mischief with camera angles and lighting; the viewer feels suffocated along with Reynolds...:::1:::B-
Nothing this underrated actor has done previously measures up to the emotional diversity, focus and self-control required of him in a one-man exercise in underground suspense that Alfred Hitchcock would envy.:::1:::3/4
Cortes has an invigorating fondness for the zoom lens. But the movie's real asset is Reynolds himself, utilizing his comedy chops for unexpected levity.:::1:::4/5
A film that takes a simple idea and turns it into a movie that elicits complex reactions from the viewer...leaves you breathless and wrung out.:::1:::None
Those who claim that Reynolds is just a handsome star should look at this nail-biting, expertly directed political thriller, which he carries single-handedly on his solid soldiers with his dramatic chops.:::1:::B+
Rodrigo Cortes keeps the action bound to the box, limiting his lighting to naturalistic approximations, so that much of Reynolds's performance consists of him grunting and heaving in the dark.:::0:::None
A brilliantly twisted suspense thriller that would have made Alfred Hitchcock proud.:::1:::4/5
(VIDEO) Easily the worst film of 2010...:::0:::F
Reynolds takes suffering for your art to unimaginable new depths in this truly underground chiller. As he excels at reaching into the theater and grabbing viewer minds. Which gives a radically new meaning to the notion of being embedded in a war zone.:::1:::None
94 minutes (in real time) of slow suffocation makes for an unusual entertainment.:::1:::B
Claustrophobic horror.:::1:::None
The basic conceit, which never falters right through to the surprise ending, speaks creepy volumes to a cinematic audience -- blanketed in darkness with no exit strategy.:::1:::3/4
As Hollywood continues to expand its bloated visions and forsakes the very tenets of basic storytelling, Rodrigo Cortes and Ryan Reynolds go just about as small as film can go and yet deliver a vastly entertaining cinema experience.:::1:::None
A remarkable, frequently spellbinding achievement...:::1:::4/4
So much more than its high-concept premise might suggest, Cortez's film is a bravura one-off whose simple-seeming title resonates hauntingly in the dark.:::1:::None
Buried is a truly compelling, novel and refreshing experience. It's a high concept film that stretches its idea over the duration of 90 minutes with ease.:::1:::4/5
...Sex in the City meets Queer as Folk in New York City's bear scene.:::1:::6/10
Director Douglas Langway is aware that while bear-ness could be seen as a response to a culture obsessed with gender-conformant and hairless young bodies, it can also be a rather unoriginal one.:::0:::1.5/4
Enjoyable. The script...features nice, authentic repartee among the guys but can't quite decide whether to show the bear lifestyle as wholesome or debauched.:::1:::C+
With its voyeuristic gawking of faintly explicit sexual acts in a dark club setting, BearCity has more in common with William Friedkin's Cruising (made in 1980) than an upbeat modern film should.:::0:::None
Of the crop of gay-centered features from TLA Releasing...the romantic dramedy BearCity certainly shows the most complexity.:::1:::3/5
Douglas Langway's middling comedy is sort of a Sex and the City for big, hirsute gay guys and the younger cubs who fancy them...:::0:::2/4
There's probably an audience for this literally fuzzy slice of gay life, but as Sam Goldwyn was wont to say, include me out.:::0:::None
Eventually buckles under the weight of affable but unfunny camp.:::1:::None
Despite a schmaltzy original score and some clunky direction, the film's well-portrayed characters and spot-on depiction of the scene make this a pleasant enough romp.:::1:::3/5
A film which is part coming out story, part romcom, and utterly uninspired throughout.:::0:::1/5
:::0:::None
It's totally ridiculous, utterly unbelievable and deliciously naughty as much as a PG-13 movie can be.:::1:::4/5
What Antin should take away from this experience is that it takes a lot more than a cliched-filled story, some dancing, forgettable music, and a bland script to make an interesting and engaging musical.:::0:::1.5/4
...wears out its welcome to an almost astonishing degree...:::0:::2/4
Welcome back, plotline of 1933; you haven't aged a bit.:::0:::2/5
The alarmingly plastic surgery-ified Cher, with her face looking like a condom stretched over a beach umbrella, gives a performance here as the club owner that's not so much 'still' as 'immobile'.:::0:::2/5
This is all about the music and director/writer Steve Antin has fashioned a spectacle worthy of Broadway.:::1:::4/5
Burlesque may be aiming for Cabaret-style glamour, but mostly it plays like stale cheese.:::0:::None
The tone is earnest, verging on sentimental. Or maybe it's just the effect of Antin's leaden dialogue, for it inspires some execrable acting. As a movie star, Aguilera is yet to shine.:::0:::2.5/5
So bad it's good or just plain bad? Terribly entertaining with emphasis on the terribly, or just, you know, terrible?:::0:::2.5/5
Burlesque is unlikely to convert any new followers to either its stars or its subject matter.:::0:::2.5/5
The images are murky and off-putting, the wisecracks fall flat, and the musical numbers aren't stylish or excessive enough to be memorable.:::0:::1/5
Yes, Burlesque is bad, but it's the good kind of bad, with plenty of unintentional laughs and a powerfully dreadful lead performance by Cher.:::1:::3/5
Burlesque offers such an archetypal Hollywood narrative that explaining what happens in the film is almost irrelevant.:::0:::2/5
Burlesque is awful. The script is horrendous. The acting is dismal. The musical numbers are glitzy and glittery, but even all the half-naked women on stage can't make this film particularly thrilling.:::0:::None
While campy and cliched, this is a surprisingly enjoyable piece of escapism with Christina Aguilera delivering an impressive turn in the lead role.:::1:::None
Yes, it bears absolutely no resemblance to the historical art of burlesque, but that's like complaining Jurassic Park didn't have enough palaeontology in it.:::1:::4/5
Even the dances feel cozily dated, as choreographers Denise Faye and Joey Pizzi borrow liberally from Bob Fosse.:::1:::None
Burlesque manages what seemed impossible: It is filled with half-naked dancing girls, yet it's still boring.:::0:::0.5/4
[Steve] Antin hasn't really written Burlesque, he has merely spooned the story out of a can labelled 'Instant Musical: Just add eyeliner.':::0:::1.5/5
Elevator music:::0:::None
Rarely have so many straight-faces been employed in the service of so many risible lines and hackneyed plot-developments as in Burlesque.:::0:::2/5
Collapses under a heap of boring love triangles, tame backstage rivalries, ear-splitting musical numbers and hyperactively edited routines.:::0:::2/5
Small potatoes to Verhoeven's masterpiece are still quite good.:::1:::3.5/5
There hasn't been a movie this fabulously awful since Showgirls.:::0:::2/5
Not enough films hit the sweet spot that Burlesque does between ridiculous, flagrantly decrepit and yet game enough in spangly execution to sweep you along.:::1:::3/5
So bad it's moderately entertaining, Burlesque is a lesson in how not to put on a musical.:::0:::2/5
There's an innocent sweetness about this showcase for Christina Aguilera's vocal and dance skills that just about excuses its utter hokiness.:::1:::3/5
Expect sequins, sparkle and camp fun, just don't go looking for sensual thrills.:::1:::3/5
verything works out very well - except for the audience, which is lumbered with all the embarrassment the film refuses to feel.:::1:::3/5
For a film with so much camp promise and the world crying out for a successor to the so-bad-it's-good cult Showgirls, this cliche packed film is disappointingly mediocre.:::0:::2/5
Although the story contains absolutely nothing new (there is a comforting familiarity to it, in fact) Burlesque has balls.:::1:::None
Burlesque explodes on screen with raunchy, contemporary razzle dazzle and knock out performances by the sizzling hot Christina Aguilera and the legendary Cher:::1:::None
Try to make 'Showgirls' for 12 year olds and you please no one. What a tease.:::0:::2/5
First off, I just can't hate any movie that features the vocals of both Cher and Christina Aguilera, not to mention a few minutes of the wonderful Alan Cumming in a scene reminiscent of 'Cabaret.':::0:::2/4
Intentionally or not, it might be the comedy of the year.:::1:::3/5
Oh God, it's terrible ... but God, it's wonderful.:::1:::3/5
Camper than Lady Gaga riding a unicorn down Brighton seafront.:::1:::4/5
It's difficult to imagine a more outrageously camp movie than this glittery romp, and fortunately there's a sense that the cast and crew understand this.:::1:::3.5/5
It's two movies in one, one of which achieves Showgirls-level badness. Burlesque's soundtrack is a much better investment than a movie ticket.:::0:::1.5/4
"Get your ass up, show me how you burlesque," growls one of this indulgent movie's indulgent musical numbers that swaggers with pearls, glitter and red lipstick - if not grammatical verb usage.:::1:::B
Has the glitz and allure of a Victoria's Secret ad. What it doesn't have is an imaginative reinvention of the show-biz cliches that have so adamantly inspired it.:::0:::None
Horrible plotting, hilariously insipid dialogue, often-awkward performances - these things add up to a film you can joyfully ridicule with your friends.:::0:::1.5/4
If you go to Burlesque expecting a campy hoot on the order of Showgirls, you may be in for a disappointment. It's not quite awful enough, although it's plenty bad.:::0:::C-
In essence, an update of an old Warner Bros. backstage musical, spiced with the ersatz-'Cabaret' naughtiness of its insular neo-burlesque club setting (complete with a barely utilized Alan Cumming as a Joel Grey-like eminence fey).:::0:::2.5/4
One dumb movie -- and that's about the nicest way of describing this amazing collection of backstage musical cliches.:::0:::2.5/5
A paste jewel of a musical, replete with shoddy script and over-strenuous staging, but some overall glamour and intermittent fun.:::1:::None
It's no great surprise that Christina Aguilera can sing. But I'm sorry to report that her breakout movie is similarly revelation free.:::0:::1.5/4
A movie called Burlesque must be tacky and trashy. And lo! it is both of these things.:::1:::7/10
Aguilera's movable feast of a body and Cher's immobile face will draw an audience to see this film.:::1:::6/10
It's camp alright: prison camp.:::0:::F
Wasn't it astonishing that the only nude scene involved not one of the burlesque dancers, but the posterior of the handsome male lead, who also has an on-and-off relationship with shirts?:::1:::2.5/4
It's epically contrived and, like some kind of gay Avatar, completely weightless underneath all the surface sheen.:::0:::2/5
As a winningly knowing exercise in ludicrously OTT extravagance, it's hard to fault.:::1:::None
Certainly, Cher doesn't need to sell herself: she's Cher, mesmerizingly fabricated, never finished. The movie doesn't seem to quite get that.:::0:::None
a heaping helping of corn pone laced with a glittering cascade of glitzy production numbers:::1:::3/5
Burlesque is a camp fiesta and a shamelessly bad good time that should be played at midnight venues with cocktails and hors d'uvres served, an entire drag court in attendance and those slightly less fabulous along for the ride.:::1:::3/5
Aguilera delivers a forgettable performance as an actress but unforgettable song and dance routines.:::1:::None
For what it's worth, it's probably the best 2-star movie of 2010 -- and if that's a prime example of damning with faint praise, it's nevertheless the best I can muster.:::0:::2/4
You know how movie stars lie and say they never see their own films? The hilariously bad Burlesque would be a great opportunity to actually follow through on that.:::0:::D
Directed and scripted by Pussycat Dolls producer Steve Antin, "Burlesque" is "Flashdance"-meets-"Showgirls" and proves that it is possible to make "Chicago" look good.:::0:::D+
Tuneless. Monotonous. Dull. Most of Burlesque's music fits the first, the plot the second and the third describes acting that is so-so within a way-too-long story.:::0:::3/5
An entertaining showcase for Christina Aguilera's amazing vocal talent. Plus glitzy showgirl routines liven things up with sexy, amusing, energetic fun.:::1:::None
A familiar cliche-ridden backstage showbiz film that's been done a million times before, but mostly better.:::0:::C
It's no turkey but a succulent bird, a (hot) pink flamingo with colorful plumage.:::1:::None
The movie is an affront to all things screenwriting; a package of empty envelopes at the cliche factory that actually should have every cliche filing a class action lawsuit to stop the film from using their likeness.:::0:::0/4
Mostly tries to copy Moulin Rouge and Chicago, but comes closer to recalling Mariah Carey's Glitter.:::0:::1/5
Rated a family-friendly PG-13, Burlesque never loses its s---, never gets erotically out of hand, never devolves into delicious camp.:::0:::1/4
It may not be the main course for the Thanksgiving weekend, but it's a pretty tasty dessert.:::1:::3.5/5
Burlesque razzle-dazzles its way through a litany of familiar showbiz cliches and comes out, for the most part, with sequins and false eyelashes intact.:::1:::3.5/5
Aguilera's voice can only carry a movie so far, and Burlesque has nothing to fall back on once the novelty of watching her tear through numbers wears off.:::0:::D+
There isn't an original thought in the entire film. If the script stinks, nothing or no one can save the movie.:::0:::None
This cast is forced to utter some of the most awful, cliched lines ever spoken on celluloid. I'd repeat some of them here, but I'm suffering from a sudden case of writer's block.:::0:::None
The dialogue falls upon the ear like baseball bats.:::0:::None
We've seen these kinds of clubs before, usually with guys dressed up as Madonna, Barbra, Cher -- wait, there's the guy doing Cher now. In a sailor hat and tights. Oh dear God ... it actually IS Cher.:::0:::3/10
Christina Aguilera's film debut in 'Burlesque' is not an updated version of 'Showgirls.' In fact, with the big screen return of Cher, along with the dance choreography and singing by the two leads, the film is really an enjoyable guilty pleasure.:::1:::2.5/4
Burlesque gets by for a little while on its spirit and general eagerness to entertain....But it quickly becomes clear that Antin has miscalculated in some major ways.:::0:::2.5/4
At least Aguilera's singing makes up for some of the rest of the film's misgivings. If only her acting was on par, and the film hadn't jumped headfirst into a tub of cliches. (Parental Review also Available):::0:::None
A campy, satisfying showcase for the impressively flashy vocal and sartorial stylings of Cher and Christina Aguilera.:::1:::None
Tells a pretty hoary old story, but does it with just enough style and conviction to get by.:::1:::3/5
As cheese, Burlesque is a processed American foodstuff pretending to be French.:::0:::None
Is it too much to ask for one wig to get snatched?:::0:::None
Falling in the pillowy cleavage between mildly awful and slightly entertaining, Burlesque is a cliched rags-to-diva story that culminates in a series of Christina Aguilera videos.:::0:::2/4
No finesse. Just plot and dialogue that land with audible thuds.:::0:::2.5/4
A love letter written in rhinestones, feathers and glitter glue.:::1:::7.5/10
Sexy musical is forgettable despite talented stars.:::0:::2/5
Burlesque may be this year's model of a solid song and dance 'feel good'. In truth, it's a trite feel nothing.:::0:::2/5
A brain dead construct that trades in absurd cliches and obvious stereotypes.:::0:::1.5/4
A generic, sanitized version of Showgirls that blatantly plagiarizes dozens of far superior musicals.:::0:::3.5/10
I was eagerly expecting Burlesque to be a gloriously bad movie. Unfortunately, it's just not bad enough.:::0:::2/5
A movie that quickly proves achingly dull, with none of the madness, verve or talent of Paul Verhoeven's "Showgirls" or even the workmanlike energy of Rob Marshall's "Chicago.":::0:::2/4
This corny guilty pleasure of a movie is a fitting two-hander for these seasoned pros.:::1:::2.5/4
Every Thanksgiving needs a turkey, and this year's comes wrapped in a lacy bustier.:::0:::C-
This is a music video; an ego piece for two fading stars that is one of the most creatively bankrupt pieces of cinema in years. Actually, most music videos are better.:::0:::0.5/5
Aguilera can dance like nobody's business, but her acting debut isn't going to keep Anne Hathaway awake at night.:::0:::2/4
This rags-to-sequins tale may be schmaltzy in its sincerity, but 'tis the season. Glitter is optional, but certainly encouraged.:::1:::4/5
You don't even have to know the title of one of Aguilera's pop hits to appreciate her performance: In case there was ever any doubt, Burlesque proves the girl's got talent.:::1:::3/4
It's big, perfectly cast and entertaining in every way, but more than that it feels like a generous public event. See it with other people. See it with a crowd.:::1:::4/4
The movie is frivolous fun, but not, as I had sort of hoped, as sinfully awful as Showgirls, Mariah Carey's Glitter or Britney Spears' Crossroads.:::1:::None
Two hours of recycled plots and plastic acting.:::0:::2/5
"Burlesque" is top-heavy from start to finish. Maybe that's what you do when you have nothing new to say.:::0:::2.5/5
I'm not a big fan of either woman, but they won me over with their willingness to commit to this script.:::1:::3/4
Shimmying, shaking and preposterous, it emerges as another splashy, sleazy showbiz tale, signifying very little.:::0:::5/10
Bugsby Berkeley with Botox. And if you're thinking pasties and poles when mulling about the movie and issues around truth in advertising, forget about it. This PG-13 contemporary rhinestone retro-romp is basically sexual innuendo with garments.:::0:::None
The tremulous collision of Xtina and the face that launched a thousand drag shows... what happens when an irresistible sex object like Aguilera meets Cher's immovable upper lip. It isn't always pretty but on occasion it's guiltily pleasurable.:::0:::B-
Approximately 10% of you are going to LOVE this movie.:::0:::2/5
Not as bad as "Showgirls" but not nearly as good as "Chicago," "Burlesque" hits its marks and high-kicks its way offstage just before it gets the hook.:::0:::2/4
Tucci is great and underused, and Cher acquits herself nicely in her first film role in seven years. But writer/director Steve Antin has his stars sashaying between dance numbers with little narrative thread.:::0:::2/4
The whole thing's so safe, so straight, so completely anti-fabulous it could put Elton John in gray flannel.:::0:::1.5/4
All the jiggly bosoms, skimpy outfits, and garish songs can't disguise the fact that this picture is utterly brain dead...only things missing here are some type of cancer scare, vampires, and a cameo by Liam Neeson.:::0:::D
Ignore the hamming; Burlesque is better at glamming, and that's just fine for those of us with a taste for glittery spectacle and earnestly campy theatrics.:::1:::3/5
I's not interesting enough to be a disaster.:::0:::2.5/4
Maybe Burlesque will serve as the imitation goods that spurs a consumer revolution for something more authentic. Aw, who am I kidding? It won't.:::0:::C-
Bland Burlesque isn't even awful enough to qualify as a so-bad-it's-good guilty pleasure. Oh well.:::0:::C-
It's Funny Girl in lingerie.:::1:::None
Gosh, the piles of silliness in this magnificent piece of trash are almost too much to bear... [T]his is the sort of cinematic junk food that the term 'guilty pleasure' was invented for.:::1:::None
Makes one long for its NC-17-rated forefather, 1995's Showgirls.:::0:::1/4
Instead of leading with what Aguilera does best -- belting, vamping, spotlight hogging -- the movie shoehorns her into a rehashed backstage musical conceit.:::0:::None
A cliched drag that wastes talented actors.:::0:::C
It's more corny than campy and more silly than sexy, much more's the pity. No one could say that Aguilera doesn't give it her all, though. This is her first real acting assignment, and by God, she's going to act.:::0:::2/4
It's entertaining enough, like watching a celebrity workout film with a plot. But never once is it believable. Really, the movie should last 30 seconds.:::1:::2.5/4
It's more hallucination than story, but hey, If you think of it as a slightly deranged long music video divathon it can be a lot of fun.:::1:::B-
If I seem fixated on appearances here, what can I tell you; there isn't much else here on which to fixate one's attention.:::0:::2/5
Showcasing Aguilera's attempt to sound like a 50-year-old black woman in the guise of white appropriation, Burlesque sells a myth about show business that is both unwelcome and shopworn.:::0:::None
A terrible film that will delight nearly everyone who sees it, whether they're 12-year-old Christina Aguilera fans or bad-movie buffs angling for a guilty pleasure.:::1:::B-
Cher gets to be a den mother, fag hag and performer all in one. Aguilera wears outrageous costumes and is gifted with shoes that look like they ran away from the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Gay men everywhere will rejoice.:::0:::C+
Brassy, bombastic and cheerfully vulgar...like a Las Vegas casino show on steroids--a piece of glitzy trash that presumably aims to be campy fun but fails miserably to achieve even that low ambition.:::0:::D+
The movie features some terribly underdeveloped characters, [but] the showy musical numbers and a great debut from Christina Aguilera make it a lot more enjoyable than you might believe.:::0:::2.5/5
Burlesque is a preposterous and intermittently entertaining lesson in how to make a movie musical with a little brains and a lot of talent.:::1:::2.5/4
About what you'd expect with burlesque show that determined to avoid an "R" rating.:::0:::C
The rest of Burlesque plays like an extended version of the "Lady Marmalade" video, with a few contrivances to provide vague conflict.:::0:::None
The choicest dialogue in Burlesque provokes the sort of laughter that other, intentionally funny films only dream of generating.:::0:::1.5/4
[a] curiously enjoyable diva mashup:::1:::3/5
Sure it isn't perfect, but Cher and Aguilera certainly make it an engaging couple of hours.:::1:::3/5
But Antin is no Bob Fosse. He's not even Debbie Allen, particularly since the choreographed numbers are edited so choppily that you never get to see a full 5-6-7-8 without a cutaway.:::0:::None
Sheesh, just shut up and dance.:::0:::1/5
Thanks to Burlesque, we now have the answer to the question: "Which film ended the film careers of both Christina Aguilera and Cher?":::0:::None
This one is strictly for Cher fans who like their campy shtick loud, lewd and ludicrous. But the biggest problem among many is that it's not her movie. She's hardly in it.:::0:::1/4
No 'Nine' or 'Chicago' but entertaining enough.:::1:::B
"Burlesque" never approaches the naughty complexity of "Cabaret" or the precision of "Chicago." For director/screenwriter Steve Antin to approach such musical high-stakes without his A-game on is unforgivable.:::0:::C
A glitzy mess and ensures the audience will have a gay old time with every bead, feather, wig and boa. Camp on steroids - I could watch Cher quiver her lips for two hours and be in cinematic heaven.:::1:::B
Yeah, girlfriend can out-sing just about anyone in the biz, even Mariah Carey these days, but that's about all that Burlesque is interested in showcasing.:::0:::2/4
A refreshing throwback to movie musicals that celebrates its stars while indulging in sexy fun.:::1:::None
An overwrought, underwritten hootchy-kootchy tuner that desperately wants to be Cabaret, but lacks the edge and historical context to pull it off.:::0:::None
There's a chance you'll like the film. Perhaps if you're Christina Aguilera's mom or the spirit of Sonny Bono reincarnated as a person who can tolerate awful movies.:::0:::1/4
Cher has the look and Aguilera has the voice in Burlesque, Antin's deliberately cliche and intentionally gay campy musical, a guilty pleasure par excellence.:::0:::C
CA horror film set in Iraq is a cinematic tour de force but raises serious questions about its ethics.:::1:::None
The film's chief virtue is that it remains true to itself - there are no sly cutaways to phones ringing in empty apartments or flashbacks to happier times, just Reynolds stuck underground and hoping for rescue.:::1:::3.5/5
Make no mistake, you can make a movie about one character inside a box interesting for 94 minutes.:::1:::None
I call 'em "gimmick thrillers," which isn't a knock -- unless you can't pull the gimmick off. For the most part, 'Buried' definitely can.:::1:::3.5/5
Tighten the screws a few more times around the middle and we could have had a genuine classic on our hands. Alas, it is still probably a very good hour-long Twilight Zone episode.:::1:::3/4
Lionsgate snatched up the picture at Sundance and there's no doubt everyone behind this minimalist stunt will make their money back from those curious to see how well they pulled off the feat. (Answer: reasonably.):::1:::3.5/5
A solid, claustrophobic thriller anchored by a great performance from Reynolds.:::1:::7/10
In purely cinematic terms, Buried, set in late 2006, is an ingenious exercise in sustained tension that would make Alfred Hitchcock turn over in his grave.:::1:::None
Cruelly efficient yet ethically questionable, Buried jangles the nerves but gets into trouble when it aspires to political topicality.:::0:::None
Go in prepared for a clever cinematic experiment, ignore the little flaws, and be rewarded.:::1:::None

An amazing human drama played out by actors at the peak of their profession: and who could want more than that?:::1:::4/5
The visual style transcends lyricism to achieve a kind of free-verse poetry, aided in large part by awe-inspiring mash-ups of montage and voice-overs:::1:::None

A totally cringe-inducing movie. Stay away from it unless you enjoy gawking at severely damaged personalities.:::0:::None
The acting is superb by all three main characters, especially Jonah Hill, who is really the key character in this film.:::1:::A
Lacks energy and seems more creepy than funny.:::0:::C
Cred points are on offer from the film's observational/improvisational style that bros Duplass bring along with them, but they've neglected the most important part - making the film interesting.:::0:::2/5
Cast and crew seem committed to making a simple point: "unhealthily close" relationships can be enriching. And the result is a movie that feels both small and deep.:::1:::4/5
Benefits from the cast teasing out the hurt and humanity from co-dependency's emotional battlefield.:::1:::None
It's funny, but edgy, too: you feel as if something very bad could happen at any moment.:::1:::3/5
Rooting awkward chuckles in freaky family ties, the Duplasses then spin our sniggers by planting parallels between John and Cyrus. Just who's the biggest man-child?:::1:::4/5
The Duplass brothers enter the mainstream with a touching, original and supremely funny film.:::1:::4/5
There are very few films, of whatever type, that actually surprise us, so when one does come along it's tempting to whoop.:::1:::4/5
Instead of all-out family farce, this goes for naturalistic acting and wry observation, and doesn't quite give us enough of anything.:::0:::2/5
It all adds to the growing suspicion that Mark and Jay are two of the most exciting filmmakers working today.:::1:::4/5
A fresh approach to the relationship comedy that will reward repeat viewings.:::1:::4/5
This film has its admirers, but I found it not-quite-funny, not-quite-insightful, and altogether oddly weighted.:::0:::2/5
A welcome change from the increasingly irony-enriched fare we've come to expect.:::1:::4/5
Simply by treating these characters as real, with all the uncertainty, emotional baggage and bad decisions that entails, the Duplasses expertly expose the hypocrisy of the airbrushed all-American ideal.:::1:::4/5
Well observed and very well acted, it's a shame the end feels like a cop-out.:::1:::4/5
The three central performances are excellent, Hill in particular is brilliant in the title role.:::1:::4/5
While it may not sound like a romcom, it's a textbook example of how to do one properly, given that it's painfully funny and surprisingly heartfelt.:::1:::4/5
Watchable relationship comedy with terrific performances from John C. Reilly and Jonah Hill and a handful of darkly funny moments, though the script is frustratingly slight in places and refuses to explore its central relationships in any depth.:::1:::3/5
The Duplasses ultimately get shy and curl away from the darker, riskier aspects of the premise.:::1:::3/5
This twisted variation on the romantic-comedy takes a sharply funny look at male relationships.:::1:::4/5
It won't blow you away, and in some respects it feels like a missed opportunity, but there is something genuine about the Duplass' film that is pleasing to see.:::1:::3/5
Domestic love triangles, empty nests, dysfunctional mommy fixation and smitten loons, while Jonah Hill does Oedipus Wrecks.:::1:::None
It's hard to imagine how no-budget filmmakers Jay and Mark Duplass could have made a better transition to the big leagues - or at least the Triple A league of indie filmmaking at Fox Searchlight - than with "Cyrus.":::1:::3.5/4
Never amounts to anything more than a limp drizzle of well-that's-awkward improv:::0:::None
The filmmakers manage to capture a world of lived-in homes (not quite urban, and not quite suburban), tired old cars, and tired people.:::1:::3/4
I haven't spent a more tedious 90 minutes in a theater since the last time I sat through something labeled 'mumblecore.':::0:::2/5
A brilliant small film that deals with big issues in a beguiling way.:::1:::3/4
It is funny, it is heartfelt, it is nicely written, beautifully acted -- and it is the Duplass brothers' most mature, most complete film yet.:::1:::3/4
Cyrus a humorous look at the pitfalls of love.:::1:::3.5/4.0
A humorous experiment in social discomfort.:::1:::4/5
About the only dishonest bone in the body of black romantic comedy Cyrus is the fact that Jonah Hill is dressed up like a plus-sized J.C. Penney catalog model circa 1992, complete with Dockers and a haircut primped for school picture day.:::1:::3.5/4
More drama than comedy, 'Cyrus' is about the love triangle that includes a man, his lover and her son, the unlovable title character.:::1:::4/4
The real revelation is Hill. Usually cast as a scruffy type, here the portly actor is fastidiously clean-cut and well-groomed, a facade of normalcy that makes his anger and insecurity all the more disturbing.:::1:::2.5/4
Marisa Tomei and John C. Reilly give depth and weight to comic neurosis:::1:::B
... short and, in its way, sweet.:::1:::3/5
...a strange way of comically celebrating the otherwise complicated (and often hurtful) topics involved.:::1:::3/5
Co-screenwriters/director Jay and Mark Duplass are smart enough to balance the darkly comic elements with equally effective dramatic moments.:::1:::3.5/4
As a romantic comedy, Cyrus ranks just ahead of Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer.:::0:::None
Wonderfully acted, kind of creepy, drolly funny and quite content to be unlike most stories out of Hollywood.:::1:::3/4
No comedy, this superbly directed film deals with a serious subject, producing top notch performances by O'Reilly, Hill, and Tomei.:::1:::7/10
Cyrus feels stretched even at 92 minutes, yet that feels nice with a quiet, well-acted film in a summer of noise.:::1:::None
John C. Reilly gives his most naturalistic, human-scaled performance since his '90s work with P.T. Anderson.:::1:::None
[M]ore of the same old sh*t roughed up around the edges to disguise its utter tediousness and depressing conventionality.... [D]reary and pointless...:::0:::None
Oedipus wrecks!:::1:::4/4
A brilliant little big studio gem that sparkles with indie sensibility by straddling the fine line between laughter and discomfort.:::1:::None
For all its edginess, this isn't a cruel comedy by any means.:::1:::3/4
In part, 'Cyrus' is about the weirdness of families -- the behaviors, secrets, humor and traditions that might be hard for outsiders to understand.:::1:::3/4
Even at its most troubling, Cyrus is powered by a deep vein of humanism, one that offers hope to even the weirdest among us.:::1:::3/4
This could have been a killer black comedy without a whole lot of rewriting, but the Duplasses opted for the awkward social comedy that doesn't deliver the consistent laughs one might expect.:::0:::C+
A shrewd and subtle film about two men who are more alike than they know.:::1:::3/4
Jonah Hill plays manipulative-possessive-needy to good sly effect as the strange-funny Cyrus.:::1:::B
Cyrus is not the jokey, polished production you would expect from its Hollywood cast and LA setting, but audiences who are comfortable with discomfort should find it "funny.":::1:::3/4
Cyrus sounds like the sort of comedy in which people end up dropping buckets of paint on each other's heads, but the Duplasses treat the characters and their dilemma with utmost seriousness, a technique that gives the movie its uncomfortably comic vibe.:::1:::3/4
The [Duplasses] manage to take a premise that begs for broad gags and instead gift it with an innate sense of characterization and a peculiar sense of humor.:::1:::None
Nobody can play beaten and amusing better than Reilly, and no one is better at playing broken, accessible beauty than Tomei.:::1:::3/4
Delightfully demented and unique.:::1:::3.5/4
A movie that melds creepy and comic so seamlessly that almost every laugh is undercut by a cringe.:::1:::4.5/5
With a half-baked story involving characters that deserve more exploration than is offered, and a third act that folds in on itself like John C. Reilly's forehead, the film ultimately disappoints.:::0:::5/10
Cyrus would be a richer, funnier film if it made the effort to figure out all three of its main characters, but it is still an entertaining comedy. I guess two out of three ain't bad.:::1:::3/4
Cyrus is heartening: as a genuinely charming romance, as an opportunity for a leading man who doesn't get enough such breaks, and as a calling card for the Duplasses, who have hit the ball quite hard on their first at-bat in the majors.:::1:::B+
Although Hill certainly has been good in previous roles, this goes beyond what we've seen.:::1:::4/5
Cyrus stays with you for a while after it's over; like an odd, unexpected party guest who nonetheless leaves an indelible impression.:::1:::3/4
The byplay between Reilly and Hill is sublime.:::1:::3.5/4
The anti-Hollywood Hollywood romantic comedy, naturalistic and acerbic rather than slick and saccharine.:::1:::B-
I was dogged by the feeling their title character isn't just edgy, he's in need of treatment.:::0:::C+
Mark and Jay Duplass have created an oddly original yet weird and natural film that interestingly balances out comedy and drama.:::1:::4/5
A heartbreakingly real and hilarious character study about a man trying to put the pieces back together and discovering one of the new ones in his life doesn't quite fit. Don't miss it.:::1:::None
Disturbing, heartening, and with a cautionary vibe and a compassionate heart, this is a film designed to fuel debate and to provide the blessed release of a good laugh when things hit too close to home:::1:::5/5
A distinct improvement over the previous efforts from the Duplass brothers and not just because there is no Greta Gerwig on display to offend the senses.:::1:::4/5
What some will relate to as authentic and real, others will dismiss as sluggish and meandering. But in a summer besieged by empty spectacles and plastic sitcom lameness, Cyrus emerges as a daring, disarming alternative.:::1:::3.5/5
The questions here are good; it's the answers that feel like a cheat.:::0:::2/4
Jonah Hill delivers a craftier comic performance than anything in his box-office hits, but what really elevates the story above its shticky premise is the combined neuroses of all three characters.:::1:::None
Cyrus is very funny, and Keener's supporting work as John's divorced ex also amuses. A pat conclusion nevertheless negates the strength of the restive narrative that precedes it.:::1:::3/5
a movie caught in some weird, in between place that makes the viewer feel a bit icky inside.:::0:::1.5/4
Cyrus" also often plays like a Judd Apatow comedy stripped to the bone. Although the Duplass brothers are credited as the screenwriters, most scenes feel as if they were largely improvised with Reilly and Hill especially forced to use their wits, which th:::1:::B
The comedy works, in large part, because it is void of a mean-spirited tone, and Cyrus never passes judgment on either John or Cyrus.:::1:::3/4
With some extra oomph and daring, this could have been a small comedic masterpiece. As it stands, it's good, but you can't help feeling it's been held back a bit. (Parental Review also Available):::1:::None
Even when we feel as if we've seen it all before, there is a distinct realness about the narrative that lifts things above the mundane.:::1:::2.5/4
Proceeds more like a mystery than a rom-com.:::1:::None
The Duplasses are showing how modern Americans think, talk and live.:::1:::3/4
A comedy of discomfort that walks a wonderful line between reality-based emotional honesty and engaging humor, it demonstrates the good things that happen when quirky independent style combines with top-of-the-line acting skill.:::1:::3.5/4
The Brothers Duplass find humor and a lot of truth in those moments between spoken words, when the flick of an eyelid, the pulse of a vein or the purse of the lips can betray things that might otherwise not be stated.:::1:::3.5/4
It's too slack to shock. The film has its moments, but it shows the Duplasses poised on the edge of the big time with nothing to say and no real interest in risk.:::0:::2.5/4
Sits precariously on the border between life's potential for happiness and disaster ... The moments between [Reilly] and [Tomei] are some of the year's most blissfully romantic.:::1:::3.5/5
Elliptical, nuanced, and non-judgmental, with hilariously genuine dialogue and exquisite performances, all of it observed with the probing eye of a Frederick Wiseman documentary.:::1:::3.5/4
The movie doesn't eagerly jump from one payoff to another, but attunes itself to nuance, body language and the habitual politeness with which we try to overlook social embarrassment.:::1:::3.5/4
The Duplass Brothers demand your undivided attention. Thanks to their sincere way with words and experience with examining distressed relationships, you will gladly give it to them.:::1:::3.5/4
Another entry in the funcomfortable genre of awkward comedy, this one would make a great anti-nice double feature with the Ben Stiller-starring Greenberg.:::1:::4/5
First and foremost an actor's dream, CYRUS proves to be one of a slow year's rare delicious comedic treats.:::1:::4/5
I think all these performances are struggling to fill in the margins here.:::0:::None
This one's a disappointment, though, even with a valiant A-list cast.:::0:::None
Too sunny, and too kind, to be classified as a black comedy, Cyrus chooses tidiness and warmth over any truly biting message or frank appraisal of its characters.:::0:::43/100
The oblique final scene seems intended to leave the viewer in a state of delicious suspense, but it feels more like a frustratingly underwritten limbo.:::0:::None
Moment to moment it's miserably enjoyable and true, especially Reilly's turn as a regressed adult who slowly learns to be the man his woman deserves:::1:::B
Cyrus begins to feel exactly like all those indie movies we desperately hoped it wouldn't turn out to be like -- quirky, talky, and yawn-inducingly familiar.:::0:::2.5/5
It's outrageous, twisted fun when boy meets girl, plus one.:::1:::3.5/4
Cyrus slows down by the end, and even before then it's often too mopey for its own good. But there's an original comic temperament at work here, and that's rare.:::1:::B+
Cyrus is strong enough to free them from their tiny corner of deep-indie cinema. But today's films have so little interest in exploring character that it's worth lamenting when one of the last champions of character specificity undershoots the target.:::0:::2.5/5
Despite their indie cred, the Duplasses are mainstream, hence the movie's status quo finish. "Cyrus" is more finely tuned than their earlier movies ("The Puffy Chair, Baghead), but it shares a similar, almost aggressive lack of ambition.:::0:::2.5/5
The picture is funny, but it has stalker-flick overtones that are unsettling, and the deft assurance with which Hill navigates the ambiguous narrative is impressive.:::1:::3/5
...still had me guessing at the final fade, which is something I can't say about any other Hollywood comedy so far this year, and something I wish I could say more often.:::1:::8/10
Domestic love triangles, empty nests, dysfunctional mommy fixation and smitten loons, while Jonah Hill does Oedipus Wrecks.:::1:::None
We all have routines, but the characters in Cyrus have complicated systems for dealing with things, and watching them smash into each other is endearing and often hilarious.:::1:::4/5
What's here is good enough to make you wish the Duplasses had gone even a little further.:::1:::3/4
Indie romcom swaps raunchiness for quirkiness.:::1:::3/5
A darkly comic drama that honors the mysteries surrounding human nature, the complexity of intimate relationships, and the bounties of friendship.:::1:::3/5
Above all, it deftly captures the ambiguity and absurdity of human relationships. With improvised dialogue and performances that go from uncomfortable to honest, Cyrus is an off-kilter charmer.:::1:::None
It's fascinating to watch the directors navigate the tricky course they've set for themselves, particularly when the narrative road splits definitively between black and light -- if exceptionally emotionally attuned -- comedy.:::1:::4/5
It wants to be a serious movie about relationships, but it also has a responsibility to the boxoffice, so at times it reaches for an outrageousness that betrays its attempts at humanity.:::0:::2/4
Cyrus successfully walks the line between dark comedy and scary movie, thanks to the performances by Hill, Reilly, and Tomei, which are uniformly great.:::1:::None
I've seldom seen a film in which three intelligent, articulate people make so many penetrating observations about themselves, and address their bizarre situation so directly, without providing, or indeed possessing, the slightest clue...:::1:::None
A comedy of discomfort that walks a wonderful line between reality-based emotional honesty and engaging humor, it demonstrates the good things that happen when quirky independent style combines with top-of-the-line acting skill.:::1:::4/5
This engaging, provocative little movie is a reminder that sometimes the person that scares you most is the person most like you.:::1:::None
... a witty relationship comedy about maneuvering through fundamental connections in order to form new ones. Hill shows off new facets in this gem of an ensemble.:::1:::B+
a compelling and enjoyable ninety minutes:::1:::3.5/5
Once again with the Duplasses, there just isn't enough of anything: not enough funny lines, not enough variation of mood, not enough plot.:::0:::C
A more sedate, straightforward comedy of discomfort and jealousy, Cyrus is a mixed bag of dramatic speeds, with the filmmakers struggling to locate a soul to a one-joke premise aching for a more profound funny bone.:::1:::B-
Despite their weird interrelations, these mismatched folks do seem like people you might know for real, the players in another of life's random acts of kinkiness that help to keep our curious species fresh and interesting.:::1:::None
This adroit squirm comedy never escalates to the slapsticky level the Hollywood version would. Rather, the Duplass brothers find humor in the real emotions of the situation.:::1:::None
Cyrus may on some level be a stunt, yet the Duplasses' slightly sluggish, low-budget, mumblecore style allows this story to flower as both light-fingered lark and drama of suspenseful dysfunction.:::1:::A-
Although the film is labeled a comedy, it hovers on the dark side in so many shadows that it is rarely amusing. Yet it never has the courage to fully explore the havoc a real Oedipus complex can wreak on the lives of real adults.:::0:::None
Neither Reilly nor Tomei have ever seemed so effortlessly funny, and whoever thought to cast one of Judd Apatow's regulars as a dysfunctional, disturbed manchild should be dubbed a genius.:::1:::4/5
A freakishly engrossing black comedy about excessively mothered men and the women who enable them.:::1:::None
What makes these Duplassian experiments work is the way their characters are willing to share their feelings.:::1:::None

Around here Daybreakers' clever streak runs out and the previously witty, refreshing film becomes a predictable action romp that's big on over-the-top gore but lacking in everything else.:::0:::2.5/5
That Daybreakers biggest problem is that there isn't enough of it should tell you enough: watching it provides short-term entertainment, but like those voracious bloodsuckers, it'll just leave you wanting more.:::1:::3/5

It's pretty clear that directors The Spierig Brothers are ready to make their mark as a couple of high-end horror genre auteurs.:::1:::3.5/5
While America continues to produce interminable undead dross ... Australia can now proudly announce itself as being home to two of the best genre auteurs working today.:::1:::4/5
The power of the Spierig Brothers is mighty and it'll be impossible to sit down without becoming absorbed in their futuristic world of vampire cliches and novelties.:::1:::3.5/5
The is no denying that the production values of Daybreakers are superb; the sophomore directing duo fill every inch of their frame with some startling effects work and detailed production design.:::1:::None
A hybrid of future dystopian sci-fi and classic vampire conventions, Daybreakers is a horror movie which boasts as many ideas as it does bloodshed.:::1:::3.5/5

Daybreakers could have been a pulpy delight instead of just another, albeit entertaining, action movie.:::1:::3/5
Despite this fascinating premise and the careful construction of ingeniously retrofitted world, Daybreakers fails to dazzle.:::0:::None
Takes an idea that also happens to be a MESSAGE, in a genre that has been sucked dry, and still make something watchable. It's not the most brilliant vampire movie ever made, but it's the best one of 2010.:::1:::3/5
Set in a near future where the entire planet has been taken over by vampires, the film is actually quite pertinent in these post-credit crisis times.:::1:::3/4
Daybreakers is a perfect panacea to audiences averse to the tweeny romanticisation of the undead by Twilight and its ilk.:::1:::4/5
Daybreakers is highly inventive, containing plenty of interesting and original ideas about vampire technology, vampire physiology and the sociological implications of a vampire world.:::1:::3/5
A first-rate vampire flick with solid action and a story that's never been seen before. Go in with high expectations and you won't be disappointed. Paul Chambers, CNN.:::1:::A-
A bad ending doesn't detract too much from the great cast, plentiful blood and guts effects and rollicking pace.:::1:::None
The special effects look cheap; and while the premise, with its "we're drinking the blood of the earth!" subtext is interesting, the characters just aren't.:::0:::3/5
More Australian filmmakers should be inspired to take on Hollywood after seeing the Spierigs' vampire venture, even if it falls short of greatness.:::1:::3/5
Stylish, engaging and yes, intelligent:::1:::None
An imaginative and arresting genre film:::1:::None
Yes, Daybreakers is another vampire film, but don't hold it against it. This is stuff Twilight fans have nightmares about...:::1:::4/5
A dreary-looking and sluggish narrative that doesn't go anywhere special.:::0:::2/5
'Daybreakers' has plenty of clever social relevance and biting political commentary mixed into the pot of gore and violence. It's got both style and smarts.:::1:::None
With Willem Dafoe is a crossbow-wielding ex-vampire named Elvis. (Coincidentally, the film opened on what would have been Presley's 75th birthday.):::1:::3/4
A fun if forgettable romp, with some great ideas and a few gruesome shock shots. Which is enough. Just.:::1:::3/5
So over the top you can't help but like at least some of it, 'Daybreakers' is pulsing with gore, mayhem and dark humor:::0:::2.5/5
Now this is a vampire movie.:::1:::3/4
Daybreakers injects just enough fresh blood into the vampire genre to make it worth your while.:::1:::3/4
A pretty ambitious movie that's occasionally capable of fulfilling those ambitions. When it doesn't, the attempt is still noteworthy and the results are at least entertaining.:::1:::4/5
An okay film about vampires and the search for blood that isn't romanticized - a la 'Twilight' -but is full of gore.:::0:::5/10
Daybreakers was unceremoniously dumped into theaters by unadventurous studio heads in the first week of January, [but] one shouldn't take their cluelessness seriously: Daybreakers is so much better than they would have you believe.:::1:::None
les deux frangins font preuve d'une rigueur creatrice que nous n'aurions jamais pu soupconner apres un exercice aussi bacle qu'Undead:::1:::6/10

Give it an A for effort, C for execution. As cool/creepy as it seems, Daybreakers just doesn't quite measure up to its potential.:::1:::2.5/4
Passable entertainment because it is more imaginative than most vampire films and because of Willem Dafoe's performance, but it should have been better.:::1:::C+
The Spierig Brothers have created an unsettlingly believable world, part Blade Runner, part Gattaca, part Blade.:::1:::4/5

Yeah, its another vampire film, but this one deals with the global end game instead of emo teen angst.:::1:::3.0/4.0

Surrounded by cannibalistic gore, Ethan Hawke and Willem Dafoe line up to drink some valuable box-office blood...call it 'From Here to Vampurity'.:::0:::5/10
A thinking person's vampire flick with deliciously gory action, an underlying social message, lean direction, and best of all, no obnoxious product placement or pop music.:::1:::4/5
Starring Ethan Hawke and Willem Dafoe, the movie, which was shot more than two years ago, is clever and gory enough to keep horror-seekers happy:::1:::3/4
Hawke gives his all here -- or maybe just half his all -- and it isn't quite enough: He's trying to be soulful, but he really just looks a little tired. The real delight is Willem Dafoe.:::0:::None
A slick, bloody, fast-paced, and ultimately enjoyable B-movie.:::1:::2.5/4
For the lowbrow, the thrill is a level of fleshy explosiveness reminiscent of David Cronenberg's Scanners. No one dies quietly; he must either detonate like Hiroshima or burst into juicy red chunks of viscera.:::1:::2.5/4
A suspenseful, visually stylish and gory sci-fi thriller that's simultaneously entertaining and provocative.:::1:::7.5/10
Unlike the current cinematic vampire milieu created for lovestruck teenagers, Daybreakers is fierce and scary and downright thrilling to look at.:::1:::3.5/5.0
[T]he perfect, ultimate, brilliant extrapolation of the vampire conceit... intensely original...:::1:::None
Daybreakers is more fun than foreboding; it's fright-lite, yet that's par for the bloody course in these busy apocalyptic days.:::1:::3/4
The action sequences are well-executed ... and the concept is just interesting enough to carry the flimsy plot through its 98 minute running time.:::1:::2.5/4
The narrative may flag, but the doomsday atmosphere and George Liddlea(TM)s production design remain vivid until the final, blood-splattered reel.:::1:::3/5
Clearly a cult hit in the making and horror fans should eat it up like a vampire with a fresh kill.:::1:::None
Robs the vampire of its supernatural bite ... All the blue filters and retro hairstyles in the world couldn't save what, for me, was a pretty lifeless bloodsucker flick.:::0:::4/10
Writer-directors Michael and Peter Spierig equip this unpretentious, low-budget, high-functioning shocker with some sharp satirical teeth, and Dafoe has a ball behind his Manson goatee.:::1:::None
That subtlety makes the Spierig brothers satisfying directors of horror and Daybreakers a small golden nugget in the rocky wasteland of January's movie releases.:::1:::3/4
Things would be real different if vampires ruled the world. Coffee would come spiked with hemoglobin, not half-and-half. Tooth-whitener ads would feature fangs. And the most compelling public-service announcement would be an hourly sunrise advisory.:::1:::4/5
Despite a few jumps in your seat and some hilarious explosions of body parts, I've seen better special effects in a Nintendo DS video game and stronger plot lines on the back of a Count Chocula cereal box.:::0:::C-
Too many logic holes and an uneven center doom what could have been a highlight of the recent vampire craze.:::0:::C+
One of the best and most inventive vampire movies I have seen in a long time. Willem Dafoe rocks this ultra-violent film with great one-liners.:::1:::3.5/5
This stylish film at least has a sense of its own absurdity. While it plays everything dead straight, it also has a lot of fun with the rules of the genre.:::1:::3/5
An ambitious premise about a future world ruled by corporate vampires is explored with some intelligence, sly humour and blood-splattering brio by the Spierig brothers.:::1:::3/5
The foolhardy Spierigs spend so much time setting up Daybreakers for a sequel, or possibly a franchise, that they leave the movie itself mostly in disarray.:::0:::2/5
The movie falls apart as if someone in the production screamed out, "Stop! We forgot to blow stuff up! Get the blood!":::0:::1.5/4
The Spierigs make some nice metaphysical points and commission some spiffy design, but resort to less-than-blood-heat thriller moves in the final third. Still very watchable, though.:::1:::3/5
Even though I'm pretty much vampired out these days, I appreciated the grossout thrills and the B-movie dialogue.:::1:::3.5/5
It's a shame Australia's Spierig Brothers opt to turn it into just any old noir-future chase movie - roughly Blade meets Minority Report, without the production flair.:::0:::2/5
It's big and brash, but were it not for Weta's visionary special effects work, there would be little to keep the blood pumping.:::0:::None
A gripping feature that is just as likely to provoke thought as it is fear.:::1:::3.5/5
Daybreakers isn't exactly good or bad, and that is the problem. The film could have broken the rules and expounded upon its initial ingenuity. It could have been about something. It's not.:::0:::2/4
Daybreakers is an entertaining genre hybrid with functioning brain cells and, in its exciting finale, an original solution to solving its vampire epidemic.:::1:::3/5
A polished, intelligent, well-acted and darkly humourous vampire tale. Fangtastic.:::1:::4/5
Iffy plotting, squiffy dialogue and directorial indecision - is this po-faced science fiction or hokey horror? - leave the film, like its protagonist, torn between two extremes.:::0:::2/5
With beautiful Blade Runner-style cityscapes, smartly conceived takes on the vampire mythos (sun-proofed cars and video mirrors), inventively engineered shocks and copious blood loss, this is an engagingly skilful blend.:::1:::3/5
Daybreakers takes the undead in an entirely different direction, melding smart sci-fi with a timely political subtext.:::1:::3/5
The yearning to become human again adds emotional heft to the gory dystopian mayhem.:::1:::None
In the end, Daybreakers doesn't really want to make anyone think too hard. If that were to happen, they might stop to wonder why all the human survivors out there hiding in fear of their lives don't just become garlic farmers and call it a day.:::0:::1.5/4
Daybreakers has substance and smarts, plus lots of visual treats for the fanboys -- a mix to keep everybody happy.:::1:::3.5/4
Despite the Spierig brothers' punchy visual style and satiric tone, Daybreakers eventually devolves, though Dafoe and his Southern drawl goose things up and Hawke has a greasy romanticism.:::0:::2.5/5
Hawke and Dafoe are both excellent and there's strong support from a suitably sinister Sam Neill.:::1:::3/5
It is a happy alternative to the tepid appeal of pre-teen vamps and werewolves. But why make a vampire movie lacking the allure of the enticing fiends?:::0:::2.5/4
There's much here to feast upon, so chow down, gorehounds.:::1:::B
Daybreakers is one of the most purely pleasurable genre films of recent months.:::1:::3/5
Parental Content Review:::0:::None
Highbrows will condescend to this movie like nobody's business. But there are a few of us left out there -- junkies for smart exploitation -- who will relish this stuff. You know who you are.:::1:::2.5/4
Though it borrows many of its ideas from older movies, the combination makes them seem fresh.:::1:::3/5
The average human body holds approximately 1.5 gallons of blood. Unless you're someone in the film Daybreakers. Then you're carrying closer to 47 gallons, 46 of which will end up splattered on a wall.:::0:::2/4
Daybreakers finally comes up with some comments on the predatory practices of Big Pharma, but that's an awful comedown from the blood-rushing brilliance of the early scenes.:::0:::None
It can't be a good sign for a vampire movie when its most memorable trait is how desperate Chrysler's product placement appears.:::0:::2.5/5
It's undeniable fun to behold the likes of serious thespians Hawke and Dafoe slumming around in this cheeseball stuff.:::1:::3/4
OK, I surrender -- this is the age of the vampire and it's best to go along for the ride.:::1:::B+
the sleekness-as-decay mode is unoriginal but it works for most of the Spierigs' film:::0:::2.5/5
Just when you think popular culture has exhausted all the metaphorical and allegorical possibilities, the film unifies all the usual tropes (bloodlust, heliophobia, fangs) into a complete science fiction whole.:::1:::3/4
The Spierigs get a lot of points for inventiveness, but their cleverly constructed, uncomfortably familiar world makes a deeper impression than much of what happens within it.:::0:::C+
...while leaps and bounds better than [the Spierig's] last, sucks the blood of too many other films and lacks logic when it does extend an original idea:::1:::B-
While the setting is sleek and filled with clever details, the story, in which one good vampire teams with a scrappy band of free-range humans to fight the power, is timeworn and predictable.:::0:::None
It sounds so very good and yet, in the hands of the Spierig Brothers, it has all the life of a vampire's (non)heartbeat:::0:::2/5
Peter and Michael Spierig's earlier, campier horror outing, the zombie picture known as Undead, was even bloodier than this one. The movie-makers are after bigger game here, and a subtler mixture of speculative nightmare and action film.:::1:::3/4
A B-movie with pretensions to something more and the effort is worth a look for horror fans.:::1:::3/5
Daybreakers has some trouble with tone but overall it's favorably comparable to well-regarded genre actioners like Blade or 30 Days of Night.:::1:::None
It's a little bit silly -- as is Dafoe's Kentucky-fried cowboy mechanic named Elvis -- but silly is fun. In fact, one wishes it were sillier still.:::1:::3/5
The Spierigs' dusky noir has plenty of style, but the movie never develops beyond its intriguing setting, and the wildly uneven performances do nothing to draw you in.:::0:::C+
This dystopian horror-thriller aspires to be a vampiric 'Children of Men', but it bears more similarity to a late-night Skinemax flick.:::0:::2/5
Although it falls apart as a thriller, Michael and Peter Spierig's black-comic splatterfest sets up an ingenious metaphor for the current economic nightmare.:::0:::2.5/4
This intriguing premise, alas, ends as so many movies do these days, with fierce fights and bloodshed. Inevitably, the future of the planet will be settled among the handful of characters we've met, and a lot of extras with machineguns.:::0:::2.5/4
I'm as surprised as anyone, but this clever vampire movie from the Spierig Brothers proves the genre still has some bite left in it.:::1:::3/4
Daybreakers isn't a great film, but it's a good one, and in a market oddly lousy with vampire tales, it's an original.:::1:::3.5/5
It's like Children of Men with exploding-plasma shock effects. The best thing you can say about the movie is that it pours some very old blood into a new plastic bottle.:::0:::C
Daybreakers reminds us that from Twilight to Underworld, True Blood to The Vampire Diaries, this is one genre where supply has utterly overwhelmed demand.:::0:::1.5/4
There's a fascinating idea at the heart of Daybreakers, where a vampire plague has swept the world and everyone's now a bloodsucker, but it doesn't quite make for a fascinating film.:::1:::3/5
Wearisome "Ain't it cool?" video-game splatter-violence is all that's memorable of the action, while a (mixed) metaphorical subtext of conservationism can't save a text that squanders its actors.:::0:::None
The Spierigs' latest doesn't do much to carve out a unique identity.:::0:::2/4
The script doesn't wring many surprises or much character involvement from the premise, and the brothers' helming, while slick, is short on scares, action setpieces and humor.:::0:::None
A clever twist on the vampire legend, delivers what genre fans crave and more.:::1:::3/5
There are more revisionist bloodsucker stories out there than you can shake a stake at nowadays, and they're getting tiresome.:::0:::None
It's a business-horror story of greed and market share...You don't have to look far (corporate global-warming deniers, anyone?) to find a corollary in contemporary reality.:::1:::None
The pacing misses a few beats and the satire never pops, but "Daybreakers" comes as a welcome retort to the vampire bubblegum genre that horror fans have had to tolerate.:::1:::B-
Even if the premise turns out to be juicier than the payoff, this sci-fi/horror thriller suggests the Spierig brothers' future might be bright.:::1:::None
A darkly stylish horror film that's unusually solid for a January release...:::1:::4/5
Ambitious, smart and unique, the film creates an entire world that is guaranteed to intrigue you and leave you wanting more.:::1:::8.5/10
A smarter and more refreshing take on the vampire genre than most of late, and a solid action flick in its own right.:::1:::None
Daybreakers offers a flawed but thoroughly enjoyable, happy-making trip.:::1:::4/5
A rock-solid afternoon matinee sort of movie, packed as it is with so many disparate genre influences. Confidently crafted and legitimately clever.:::1:::4/5
"Horror fans should be looking forward to this one.":::1:::8/10
While it's far from perfect, Daybreakers is an incredibly fun movie. Loaded with talents actors, beautiful camerawork (a stunning slow-mo shot in the finale proves this) and buckets from indie obscurity to the mainstream without compromising their ideals or sacrificing the quality of their character-driven storytelling.:::1:::8/10
Engaging and emotionally edgy, families don't come more dysfunctional than this one.:::1:::6/10
"Third-act failure" hobbles what could have been a rewarding black, or at least dark, comedy...:::0:::C-
Jay and Mark Duplass inch closer to successfully infusing comedy-of-awkwardness with pained pathos in Cyrus, a big-studio mumblecore hybrid of Mr. Woodcock and the Martin Short-Charles Grodin vehicle Clifford.:::1:::3/4
Another quirky, original panel (this one really dark comedy about mother-son peculiar bond) in the growing body of work of the gifted indie directors.:::1:::B
Step aside, Sophocles. This Oedipal story is funny!:::1:::B+
The Duplasses' sensitivity, which is genuine, yields too much tepid relationship-speak, and Marisa Tomei, one of the most appealing actresses in Hollywood, is left with little to play.:::0:::None
This darkly comical look at the human condition is guaranteed to earn the Duplass brothers an entirely new audience.:::1:::3.5/5
The best we've seen from Jonah Hill and yet another in the long line of wonderful performances from John C. Reilly.:::1:::None
It's easy for a swingin' ladies man like myself to appreciate why a less fortunate character might project gratitude at the generosity of a compassionate companion. I assume that's what one might relate to if one has lived through those feelings.:::1:::None
If the plot development lurks on cusp of credibilty, the characters feel genuinely complex and are given a real sense of humanity by Tomei Reilly and Hill.:::1:::3/5
Takes a broad comedic premise, gets laughs out of it, then somehow manages to treat it realistically, too. What could have been a silly farce is instead a down-to-earth, highly enjoyable film.:::1:::A-
a highly entertaining, even somewhat moving comedy:::1:::9/10
All the improvised dialogue, herky-jerk camerawork and social discomfort of previous Duplass films is here, along with name actors playing damaged but ultimately human characters.:::1:::None

Devil features nothing new, exciting or suspenseful. Instead, it gives us shallowly developed characters and an ultimately forgettable story.:::0:::3/10
M. Night Shyamalan at his most messianic -- he just takes too long to get to the frights.:::0:::2/4
The characters are unlikable and annoying but the suspense built up is very real, making "Devil" a thriller worth checking out.:::1:::3.0/5
It always makes me apprehensive to see a movie that was not screened for critics in advance. "Devil" looked like it could have been an interesting film, but [it turns out] the lack of faith was justified.:::0:::2/4
Although it doubtless will find more success in the DVD market, on the big screen Devil makes for bland viewing.:::0:::2/5
Nonsensical to the point that every element doesn't hold up to the least bit of scrutiny.:::0:::C-
This movie's job was to whip up a little fear and/or suspense, but it must have escaped through a crack in the elevator doors.:::0:::1/5
Circling wildly within the film's main set -- a stalled elevator car -- or hurtling up and down an empty shaft, Mr. Fujimoto's camera is as giddy as a tween at a Justin Bieber concert.:::0:::2.5/5
Un ejercicio de suspenso sobrenatural bastante efectivo, sobre todo en su primera parte, aunque lleno de lugares comunes mas bien irritantes. Y, sobre todo, con la reiterada pretension evangelizadora que inunda el cine de M. Night Shyamalan...:::0:::2/5
[M]ost of its promise is squandered through inept scripting and a failure to indulge a self-aware enthusiasm for its B-movie concept.:::0:::2.5/5

An excellent and often intense peak in to the battle of good and evil...:::1:::None
For a small package, it conjures up some effective ideas and scares, as well as some terrific atmospheric moments.:::1:::3/5
A small scale but modestly effective broken elevator thriller that is more Agatha Christie than Alfred Hitchcock.:::1:::B
Devil is pretty obvious in its intentions, with not-so-subtle religious metaphors spread throughout, but the film delivers enough thrills and chills to keep audiences entertained.:::1:::8/10
Holy mother of god: behold the first M Night Shyamalan-associated film in the last 4 years that doesn't utterly blow.:::1:::3.5/5
M. NIGHT Shyamalan has churned out a few stinkers of late, but his new thriller Devil could mark his return to form.:::1:::3.5/5
Devil is an engrossing mesh of Catholic philosophy and supernatural thrills.:::1:::3.5/5
Though the poster bravely boasts this movie as being ''from the mind of M Night Shyamalan'', Devil is actually not an over-long, near-unwatchable piece of badly directed high-concept dross, but a tight little killer thriller.:::1:::2.5
Entertaining, spirited mystery which mercifully avoids the grisly path, but loses its way in simplified sermons.:::1:::3
The movie has Shyamalan all over it - and not in a good way.:::0:::1/5
It's voyeuristic and compelling.:::1:::None
I'm not sure which sentence sounds more like the set up for a joke: 'Five people walk into an elevator...' or 'A new film from the mind of M. Night Shyamalan'.:::0:::2.5/5
If there's a market out there for small-scale, efficient, moderately creepy thrillers, then a Night Chronicles series could work -- right up to the moment Shyamalan starts coming up with those lame twist endings again.:::1:::None
Tense, overheated but played rigorously straight, Devil is exactly what you want from a B-movie.:::1:::3/5
When Devil tries to be scary, however, it more-or-less succeeds.:::1:::None
Despite a terrific premise and strong performances, this chiller is let down by its ineffective build-up and trite conclusion.:::0:::None

It?s possible the devil is at work here, if it?s a demonic plan to damn movie audiences to a purgatory of boredom.:::0:::1.5/4
... the movie does have its unpleasant pleasures ...:::1:::3/5
A clever and dark little tale of horror with an entertaining 'whodunit' aspect to it.:::1:::None
Because the prospect of being trapped in an elevator is so naturally frightening for many of us, 'Devil' obviously underachieves.:::0:::2/4
A modest and sometimes silly but fun thriller; the killings are ingeniously crafted so that the deaths occur offscreen, which doesn't lessen their impact.:::1:::3/4
Any fan of detective fiction will tell you that for a locked-room drama to work, you can't let anyone, including the reader, exit the locked room.:::0:::2/4
"Devil" is Effectively Creepy but Still has M. Night's Shaky Take on Faith and Religion.:::1:::3/5
Shyamalan's story is sound, but the execution dragged me to hell and left me there wondering if his much-rumored sequel to Unbreakable was ever going to arrive.:::0:::2/5
There's nothing special about the picture, but after a string of notorious flops, it's surprising to see Shyamalan involved with a film that's at least watchable.:::0:::2.5/4
Like a Goosebumps adaptation for semi-adults. This creature's not scary or gory enough for anyone over 15 but takes a few stabs at notions of revenge, guilt and forgiveness. Then shrugs, folds up its wings and screeches back off into the darkness.:::0:::None
There's an old belief in TV series production circles that if you're doing a stuck-in-an-elevator episode before Season 4, it's a telltale sign you've run fresh out of ideas.:::0:::None
Devil really isn't that bad.:::1:::3/4
While the script throws a few spiritual contrivances our way, it's a fun and tense watch and a promising start for the 'Shyamalan Presents' marque.:::1:::3/5
From a director who's had a devil of a time lately comes a "Twilight Zone"-ish horror movie.:::0:::2.5/4
Shyamalan's fingerprints are all over this gimmicky supernatural thriller, that comes with his usual third act twist.:::1:::B-
A Night Gallery reject worth experiencing only to gape at a "spirituality" that falls somewhere between Dostoyevsky and Jack Chick, and to laugh that such daring feats of narrative illogic were undertaken with a straight face.:::0:::None
The movie isn't unwatchable, but it's certainly a few jolts shy of the scream fest it wants to be.:::0:::2.5/5
Don't be fooled by the melodramatic speechifying (or that unfortunate voiceover) -- this film offers sly winks aplenty beneath the good-and-evil bluster.:::1:::3/4
This is the sort of cut-rate cinematic Cheez Whiz that gives religious horror movies a bad name. Still, at least it's not The Last Airbender.:::0:::1/5
The relatively unknown cast delivers solid performances all round, and director John Erick Dowdle keeps things interesting and well paced.:::1:::3/5
DEVIL is actually superior to any of Shyamalan's recent directorial outings even as it recycles themes and ideas from his earlier works.:::1:::None
A surprisingly suspenseful and entertaining film, it is Shyamalan's best in a while.:::1:::7/10
The great cinematographer Tak Fujimoto has the time of his life on this low-budget horror feature, playing with dolly shots, abrupt zooms, and negative space inside the widescreen frame, and the fun is infectious.:::1:::None
Don't let the Shyamalan snickering sway you from seeing this in theaters. You're bound to see it on DVD or cable down the line and regret that it took you that long to discover how good of a film it actually is.:::1:::None
At best a cheesy, unsatisfying thriller and, at worst, a waste of time.:::0:::1.5/4
a much better film than it will be given credit for, which is a shame, particularly in an era in which horror films increasingly focus on trendy nihilistic pointlessness:::1:::3/4
Shockingly, the whole thing probably would've been better off if Shyamalan himself had been involved beyond conception and producing.:::0:::D+
If this is the start of the series, then bring on more of The Night Chronicles, because Devil is great fun without any pretense, and the best thing Night's name has been on in years.:::1:::None
There are a great many examples of "no" in DEVIL . . . No suspense. No scares. No originality. No fun. No reason to bestir oneself to see it.:::0:::0/5
[V]eers from the intensely banal... to the impossibly ludicrous...:::0:::None
Who's the devil in the elevator? I vote for the guy who farts or the rugrat who considers the pressing of fifty buttons indistinguishable from play.:::0:::D

Its disposable nature belies a much better film lurking in there somewhere.:::0:::C+
It's a good concept with five strangers stuck in an elevator with bad things happening. Unfortunately, the devil is included every step of the way.:::0:::3/10
promising but stunted:::0:::2/5
If M.Night Shyamalan's name as the originator of the film's story isn't enough to alert would-be viewers to its tritely cliched aspirations, then suffering through this pap should do the trick of keeping those poor souls away from his work forever more.:::0:::F
Devil is nothing very special or original, but it gets the job done briskly and economically.:::1:::None
Enjoyable, well acted supernatural thriller that does exactly what it says on the tin and is nowhere near as bad as its lack of press screenings would suggest.:::1:::3/5
A Sunday school parable wrapped in an adequately nail-biting supernatural thriller, Devil uses its triteness to its advantage.:::1:::3/5
Devil's low-grade hokum would be hard enough to stomach without the spiritual component; confining half the action to a small space where everyone's a suspect mostly results in characters looking shifty and shouting accusations at each other.:::0:::D
Its overall slightness as a chiller only stresses that this was material unworthy of a notorious control freak filmmaker's undivided attention.:::0:::2/5
Taut and slickly directed, Devil is actually one of the more solid genre movies we've seen all year.:::1:::3/5
It's not a great film. But it held my interest throughout and released me at just the right time. (Parental Review also Available):::1:::None
A capably directed murder mystery in confined spaces.:::1:::2.5/5
At least this time Dowdle has an excuse--'Shyamalan made me do it.':::0:::D
A horror flick by way of a "gimmick thriller," with a few dashes of Irwin Allen and Agatha Christie thrown in for flavor.:::1:::3.5/5
A pocket-size supernatural thriller that plays a bit like Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians retold by an unstable Sunday School teacher.:::0:::C+
Ultimately, the fact it's all down to the, um, Devil, means all the other characters' dark secrets that come to light are a bit pointless.:::0:::2/5
I do not understand the hatred for Shyamalan. Yes, he has trouble directing actors but Devil is a very intriguing idea executed in a relatively mediocre fashion.:::1:::3/5
A taut, psycho-supernatural chiller with an elegantly simple premise: Five strangers, trapped in the elevator of a highrise, start to go nuts.:::1:::3/4
On paper it's a ridiculous premise, but in execution works surprisingly well. At the very least, you've never seen another film quite like it.:::1:::B+
This office building had so many employees. Not just the people renting office space, but a security staff, cleaning crew and maintenance. How are we having an economic crisis when there are so many jobs available in every skyscraper?:::1:::None
Moves over the line from kind of creepy to kind of stupid. It never recovers, and the last act is sadly unsatisfying.:::0:::C
Overall, 'The Devil' is a roller coast ride of hits and misses, and unfortunately, wi of blood, I can't recommend this enough.:::1:::7/10
...an exciting (albeit slightly uneven) addition to the vampire-movie canon.:::1:::3/4
:::0:::2/5
:::1:::4/5
Inundated with liches and lazy plot twists, this Dwayne Johnson vehicle is a complete waste of time.:::0:::0.5/5
enough grunt to send audiences home feeling there's potential in the former wrestler as the successor to Schwarzenegger and company:::1:::3/5
If this was a tiny bit smarter (think Desperado, or even Kill Bill Vol. 1) or a whole lot dumber (Machete), it would be so much nearer to hitting its target.:::0:::2/5
A hollow poser through and through.:::0:::C-
There are a lot of good examples of films that explore the deeper conflict and hypocrisies surrounding the brutality of getting even and the toll it takes on the soul/psyche of the vengeful person. This ain't one of those movies.:::0:::1.5/5
Who is the unseen Mr Big who masterminded the massacre? The answers to these questions prove to be not particularly interesting, and the religiose conclusion appears to be a bid for support from the Bible Belt.:::0:::None
A slow, turgid thriller featuring pointless and poorly executed car chases, chasm-like logic gaps, dreary characters and phoned-in performances.:::0:::2/5
It's an exercise in synthetic attitude, and proof that Jason Statham, with his not-dissimilar Charles Bronson remake The Mechanic, has dislodged Johnson as the more reliable tough action star de nos jours.:::0:::2/5
Writers Tony and Joe Gayton feed the trio just enough lines to make it seem like a team effort.:::0:::2/5
Packed with car chases and shoot outs, this isn't subtle, but there are some unexpected twists and surprisingly well-rounded characters, particularly Thornton's detective.:::1:::3/5
It's the sort of film where somebody can be shot through the back of the head yet still get up and walk.:::0:::2/5
An unremarkable B-movie revenge thriller.:::0:::None
What this has over other action fare is that all the main players have the ability to emote; say what you like about Johnson, he has enough presence and charisma to make this old vehicle purr.:::1:::None
Director George Tillman Jr keeps revving it up, but this just gets tangled and boring.:::0:::1/5
Johnson has just hit rock bottom.:::0:::2/5
The artist formerly known as "The Rock" deserves so much better.:::0:::2/5
Faster is sufficiently visceral to offer the sort of puerile pleasure that many will happily plead guilty for at the box office.:::1:::3/5
It's glossily entertaining stuff. And yeah, it's fast-ish... though Furiouser nails it better.:::1:::None
Fast-paced and tightly written, this is an entertaining revenge thriller with strong performances, exciting action sequences and an impressively stripped down aesthetic that works well.:::1:::4/5
If for some reason you thought you couldn't get bored of watching a former WWE champion lurching around shooting people in the head, you were wrong.:::0:::2/5
As a violent but mediocre nod to '70s action thrillers, it's a curiously inert affair, leaving the one-time Rock to pass the time by shooting people in the head. Missable.:::0:::2/5
Although they're all indebted to some other film, there are some nice touches here.:::1:::3/5
If Faster were made 35 years ago or by the French or Japanese, it would be one of those grimy, long forgotten films you expect Quentin Tarantino to be touting.:::0:::C-
How do we know that The Driver is a bad mf? Why, the first thing The Driver does once he's beyond the prison doors is to tear up the business card that the warden gave him. What is the essence of a man... who can tear up cardboard with such vigor?:::0:::None
With a comically masculine vibe, this grisly rampage of revenge is inventive enough to hold our interest. Although even a tiny flicker of knowing dry humour would have made it a lot more entertaining.:::1:::3.5/5
Faster is many things; none good. It's a languid, sub-CSI police procedural intertwined with a sluggish revenge flick and drizzled with the inane relationship dramas of a newly married hitman struggling to figure out his work/life balance.:::0:::1.5/5
Cutting right to the chase, Faster seldom slows down.:::1:::3/5
Faster surprises with its mix of heavy drama and action, yet takes itself to darn seriously.:::1:::3/5
A vicious revenge flick riddled with unfulfilled ambitions.:::0:::1.5/5
So what if Faster doesn't quite hang together as a movie? It is still worth hanging out with if you're that particular type of action fan with a hankering for home-brand hard-assedness.:::1:::2.5/5
The screenwriters should have centred the story around Jackson-Cohen's character instead. It would have made for a better film.:::0:::C+
A soulless revenge movie where the uber-slick, uber-hackneyed design takes precedence over story, character and theme may stir a few looking for a flick with fast cars, slow men and the rule of the gun, but it's mostly laborious and often ludicrous.:::0:::2/5
Faster slides between tones like a blues guitarist between frets -- mingling Biblical allegory with blatant parody, yet never letting one cancel the other out.:::1:::3.5/5
A surprisingly above-par actioner.:::1:::3/5
Faster is not fast enough. It's a bloody revenge fantasy starring the massively muscled Dwayne Johnson, whose emotions run the gamut from A to, well, A.:::0:::2/5
While it sticks to the formula of a revenge thriller, the characters are fully realised, surprisingly transforming this into a compelling human drama.:::1:::None
There's a primal intensity, both adrenal and emotional, flowing through Tillman Jr's frenetic direction and Johnson's gritty performance that suggests there's more going on under the hood than the stock fittings let on.:::1:::4/5
The redeeming factors of this heavy-handed, dumbed down movie for action-loving young males are its eccentricities and contradictions.:::1:::None
It's about time Dwayne Johnson got back down to business. After silly Disney ventures such as 'The Tooth Fairy' and 'Race to Witch Mountain,' Johnson finally is featured in material for which he was born.:::0:::2.5/4
Logic doesn't slow Johnson's Faster.:::1:::3.0/4.0
...the story line, which includes a theme of moral renascence of forgiveness and redemption, elevated the film above what one generally gets in this genre.:::1:::7/10
...a watchable yet unsatisfying thriller that begins to evaporate from one's memory minutes after it ends...:::1:::2.5/4
By and large, Faster is what would happen if Michael Bay channeled one of Donald Westlake's Parker novels, recently back in vogue.:::0:::1/4
What sends Faster into headache-inducing territory long before the uninspired-twist climax are the nauseatingly edited chase scenes and plot holes large enough to drive a Mustang through.:::0:::0.5/4
This is a movie on the verge of being great but it never gets there. It is too much Rock and not enough Dwayne Johnson.:::0:::4/10
has a hard time matching Johnson's heavy forward momentum, primarily because the film is stacked so heavily with subplots that are constantly taking us away from The Artist Formerly Known as The Rock:::0:::2/4
Riotously surreal and willfully so, it showcases Dwayne Johnson's star power, not to mention his pecs:::1:::3/5
Take "Kill Bill," remove all wit, characterization, style, originality and anything else that made it entertaining ... that will get you close enough to the experience of seeing "Faster.".:::0:::4/10
A violent, smart return from Disney-land to a lethal landscape better suited for a man with 'guns' for arms and a head shaped like a bullet.:::1:::3/4
Faster is smarter, deeper and all around better than the mediocre movies that were initially Dwayne Johnson's bread and butter. If some rickety plot mechanics prevent it from fully making the grade, it still registers as a worthy try.:::1:::2.5/4
Johnson, as WWE fans quickly learned, has charisma to spare. In person, he is sharp-witted, funny and effortlessly engaging. Those qualities translate easily to the screen, but 'Faster' never gives him a chance.:::0:::1.5/4
Casting Billy Bob Thornton in Faster means it's more than just a generic action vehicle for the man once known as The Rock.:::1:::3/4
Just released from a 10-year stint in jail, the Rock looks more like the Hulk, stomping across the landscape, bent on revenge. Maybe it's a ruse -- he's trying to scare away any further offers for family films.:::0:::2.5/10
May look like another brain-dead action picture, but it's surprisingly thoughtful and emotionally effective.:::1:::3/5
Empty, fleeting stuff that resonates only long enough for the next car chase/fight scene/shoot-out to come along.:::0:::1.5/5
Perhaps it was unnecessary, but there are moments of great art in Faster, teasing that perhaps George Tillman Jr. may one day make a great film.:::1:::B-
Faster is empty-calorie action trying to disguise itself as gourmet genre dining. Not that those empty calories can't be tasty - they're just so damned forgettable.:::0:::None
A film like this lives and dies with its action. Here, director George Tillman Jr. goes the minimalist route for the most part, and it's a good decision. (Parental Review also Available):::1:::None
Only Gugino, one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood, displays emotional complexity - and do you really need that in an action flick? Actually, yes.:::0:::None
Faster was built for speed, and for an action-savvy audience who can appreciate a throwaway vengeance flick for exactly what it is.:::1:::7/10
In Faster, the cliches -- er, characters -- aren't named, they're labelled. (Better to keep track of them that way.):::0:::2/5
Structurally "Faster" is as blocky as its star. Fancy camera angles and changes in hue cannot camouflage its stumbling, blunt-force narrative style, in which plot turns are dropped like bricks.:::0:::2/4
The Killer subplot looks and feels like it was grafted on with Krazy Glue. Thornton's character never adds up. And the film's big whiplash surprise ending is a real you've-got-to-be-kidding groaner.:::0:::2/4
By the end of this underwritten wanna-B movie, only the black-and-white muscle car is left standing with its dignity intact.:::0:::1.5/4
Despite much effort, neither Johnson nor director George Tillman Jr. can make this preposterous tale, the latest misfire from CBS Films, live up to its title.:::0:::1/4
Johnson's performance is one of seething rage camouflaging emotional scars as ugly as the physical ones, a grim, single-minded figure straight out of a Jim Thompson or Richard Stark novel.:::1:::3/5
Watching Driver peel rubber proves B grade action movies are a welcome diversion in the era of CGI blockbusters. If only Faster didn't fizzle each time Johnson put down his gun.:::0:::2/5
Faster actually wants us to take this seriously, and it's crushed under its own weight with this assertion.:::0:::D-
Faster turns out to be a better-than-average vendetta film with enough forward momentum to k.eep audiences glued (Elmer's, not Super) to their seats:::1:::2.5/5
After an initial burst of energy, things trudge along.:::0:::2/5
Why didn't they just call the movie Kill Them All?:::0:::0/4
Tillman Jr. never does find an interesting way to intertwine the three stories, leaving the tale of justice and injustice disjointed and disappointing.:::0:::2/4
There's actually a lot of things to like about Faster, but the final mixture of dissimilar elements leaves us with a strange creature whose head doesn't quite know what its tail is doing.:::0:::3/5
Johnson's movies work best when he's playing his funny opposite. Comedy is hard. Badass is not.:::0:::2.5/4
Despite its shortcomings, including a predictable plot twist, "Faster" isn't the turkey you might expect it to be.:::1:::2.5/4
Most of it is pretty predictable, familiar stuff. But Dwayne Johnson has a presence whose sum is more than the total of his acting parts.:::0:::2/4
Sometimes all you really want is a cheese sandwich. Sometimes it's fun to be 12, for a while.:::1:::3/4
An action thriller that, while flawed, still reminds us that, if he really wanted to, The Rock could still become the next Schwarzenegger.:::1:::2.5/4
Rotate the plot, change the period, spruce up the dialogue, and this could have been a hard-boiled 1940s noir. But it doesn't pause for fine touches and efficiently delivers action for an audience that likes one-course meals.:::0:::2.5/4
The woozy sense of sick doesn't make it to the very end, but it carries the picture far enough to eth Shyamalan's fan appeal at basement level these days, the filmmakers' efforts will not be recognized.:::1:::2.5/4
Shyamalan has instead indulged his moldy sense of protracted mischief, providing pedestrian thrills to fans who'll see every turn of this feature coming a mile away.:::0:::C-
Starts with a great idea and then does little with it. Devil goes through the one-note motions and ultimately becomes something no horror movie should be: boring. Those main credits, though&#151;what a doozy.:::0:::2/4
With no characters worth caring about, a heavy reliance on a final-act twist, and absolutely no sense of suspense, "Devil" completely blows the chance to build on what could have been an effective story.:::0:::1/5
:::0:::2/4
:::1:::3.5/5
I expected more from Rob Reiner.:::0:::2.5/5
A surprising-engaging and beautifully-told story about young romance.:::1:::5.0/5
Has my heart grown so cold and battle-scarred that I can't allow myself to be completely won over by Flipped, or is Flipped such a load of flavorless mush that there's not enough charm for me to embrace?:::0:::None
At times, the movie feels like a commercial for Wonder Bread, stretched to feature length.:::0:::1.5/4
The importance of understanding varying perspectives is always worth communicating, and Flipped, despite its cloying approach, manages to deliver this idea with a decent amount of sincerity intact.:::1:::6/10
If the feature doesn't latch on to the senses immediately with its sugared claws, it's a long, ugly 85 minutes of dreadful behavior to endure, waiting for an ending that never arrives.:::0:::D
I suppose some people may respond to this nostalgic ode to innocence and chastity, but I found it insufferable.:::0:::1/4
...if you want a wholesome, ultimately feel-good film about young love, this might be it. Or not.:::0:::5/10
Not perfect, but its aspirations are admirable, and its execution is surprisingly effective considering (or maybe because of) its unadulterated sentimentality.:::1:::B+
The movie feels static, like a diorama of ?60s life rather than a living, breathing story.:::0:::2.5/4
Rob Reiner seems to be aiming for a boomer audience, but it's a relentless exercise in nostalgia -- clothes, hair styles, cars, and doo-wop soundtrack -- that feels manipulative.:::0:::2/4
You'll flip for this gentle, clever movie. You are hereby forgiven for "North," Mr. Reiner.:::1:::4/4
Perfectly innocent, unexpectedly charming.:::1:::None
...takes what could have been a charming coming-of-age story and buries it beneath layers of cinematic overkill that push you away from the film when they should be drawing you in.:::0:::3/10
Flipped is Rob Reiner's best film in 18 years.:::1:::3.5/4
The latest from director Rob Reiner is a well-meaning mess that wants to tap into universal experiences of childhood and first love but bogs down in squirm-inducing banalities.:::0:::2/4
The kids provide an earnest emotional through line to a tiny story, and I sort of hope it kicks off a new mature period for Reiner as a filmmaker.:::1:::B
It makes sense that Flipped is based on a book, because what it has going for it is a charm -- the pleasure of hanging out with likable characters -- that the movies don't have much time for lately.:::1:::3/4
Flipped is as phony as a poodle-skirted waitress at a mall diner, yet it's as sweet as a malt. A vanilla one.:::1:::2.5/4
Reiner was clearly sick the day they taught filmmaking at film school-you show, not tell the audience what's going on. What at first seems sort of clever quickly turns into an exercise in exasperating tedium.:::0:::3/10
Reiner, who made the similarly themed The Sure Thing about opposites who repel and attract, is a most sympathetic director of actors.:::1:::3/4
This is the movie version of comfort food from your grandmother: Familiar, wholesome and rather bland.:::0:::3/5
Rather than providing insight into childhood and the past, Flipped merely panders to those who want to idealize them.:::0:::2/5
It's a bit too Wonder Years at times, but the odd two-narrators gimmick plays right into the film's "flip" in structure.:::1:::3/4
[C]harming little coming-of-age teen romance... It's [a shame that] a lovely movie that's truly suitable for the whole family cannot find an audience in the current movie environment.:::1:::None
A remarkable family film that accomplishes something rare: It catches its young protagonists in the act of growing up, of beginning to learn who they are.:::1:::B+
Flipped is essentially a Hail Mary pass designed to remind us that director, producer and co-screenwriter Reiner is the guy who made Stand By Me.:::0:::2/5
...an utterly charming coming-of-age movie that deserves to be widely seen instead of dumped into the end-of-summer wasteland.:::1:::4/5
Though larded with voice-over narration by its early-'60s-era adolescent protagonist, Rob Reiner's wholesome movie of teen romance gels into a sturdy drama.:::1:::B+
We all remember the days when the smallest act of kindness or meanness changed everything and, thanks to two very strong central performances, Flipped captures the essence of those times in a gentle, sentimental romance.:::1:::None
You won't find two better youthful actors directed by a comic genius in any other film this summer.:::1:::None
Reiner has given this generation of moviegoers a peek at a simpler time, an era in American history that was innocent, yet on the verge of losing that innocence.:::1:::None
A wholesome, genuinely heartfelt, sweet and uplifting story that everyone, young and old, can easily fall in love with.:::1:::9.0/10
This is a slow, pretty, one-dimensional undertaking. The story is free of any real conflict or depth -- it's just kind of big and shiny, not unlike an expensive Hallmark greeting card.:::0:::2/5
Coming-of-age romance brings light touch to heavy themes.:::1:::3/5
Upon reflection: if the subject in this 'Rashomon-com' isn't all that involving at first glance, a second peek from the other side of the looking glass may not carry that much more insight.:::0:::4/10
Flipped is a sweet, engaging family film with enough heart for two movies.:::1:::5/5
That Flipped isn't insufferably cute is a measure of its integrity. But it still strains to view the world through the eyes of children without a filter of grown-up cynicism.:::0:::2.5/5
We have here a movie that's pitch-perfect one minute and awkwardly schmaltzy the next.:::1:::2.5/4
The whole thing would go down like a peanut butter and marshmallow sandwich, were it not for the lively lead presence of Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe, two young talents who make the movie better than it deserves to be.:::1:::2.5/4
There's barely half a film here, stretched and pulled so thin you can nearly see through it.:::0:::2/5
Rob Reiner's best effort in more than ten years.:::1:::B
An endearing story that follows the obsessions and frustrations of first love.:::1:::4/5
A pleasantly nostalgic and well-intentioned family movie featuring strong performances by its young actors.:::1:::2.5/4
With great sensitivity and insight, Reiner evokes the agonizing sweetness of first love and the way that it stays alive in us always.:::1:::B+
A minor pleasure that will strike a lot of moviegoers -- those who think no one makes movies for them anymore -- as a major treat.:::1:::2.5/4
Flipped offers an achingly familiar look at puppy love from two contrasting angles, each of them insufferably saccharine.:::0:::F
Based on a popular young-adult novel and brimming with all the angst and schmaltz you'd expect from such a source, this awkward coming-of-age drama does nothing to gild the legacy of middlebrow maestro Rob Reiner.:::0:::None
Youth and nostalgia are no excuse; even The Wonder Years called off the narration so the story could tell itself.:::0:::2/5
Reiner's picture lands somewhere between synthetic nostalgia and the texture of real life.:::0:::2/4
Sitting through Rob Reiner's adaptation of Wendelin Van Draanen's YA novel is like watching the summer's worst movie -- twice.:::0:::1/4
Maybe what makes Flipped such a warm entertainment is how it re-creates a life we wish we'd had when we were 14.:::1:::3.5/4
The central character is so mealy and formless that you hope he'll get hit by a truck or otherwise disappear, replaced by a character with whom you actually want to engage.:::0:::None
A treacly tweener saga of first love that drowns in nostalgia, Flipped furthers Rob Reiner's slide into irrelevance.:::0:::1.5/4
...this 'He said/She said' look at a couple of kids' formative years has so much narration it's more illustrated book than movie, but it certainly is a cute read.:::1:::B-
Though the dialogue rings too chirpy ("Gee whiz!") and faintly anachronistic ("Get over it, man!"), the acting is wonderfully subtle...:::1:::3/5
A faint recommendation, especially to anyone feeling nauseated by Johnson's recent career choices.:::1:::B-
There is nothing subtle about "Faster," and that's the best thing about it.:::1:::3/5
Faster ... leaves it to Johnson -- as deadly focused as a gunsight -- to make it all believable. The problem is, he can't..:::0:::D
Taut and economical, saying a lot as the characters say little.:::1:::2.5/4
[Dwayne Johnson] doesn't speak a lot (he's only gets chatty in his kiddie flicks), but that's fine. He can stare down with the best of them.:::1:::B-
Dwayne Johnson finally back as a badass, a classic, hot rod Chevy SS with a Hurst 5-speed, a big honking revolver - all brought together in a revenge flick... What's not to like?:::1:::3.5/5
It's not particularly good, but at least The Rock isn't wearing a tutu.:::0:::2.5/5
The Rock didn't start calling himself by his actual name, Dwayne Johnson, so he could make garbage like "Faster.":::0:::0/4
"Faster'' is meat-and-potatoes action with a side of crazy.:::1:::2.5/4
... a film as brutally simple and yet unexpectedly complex as 'Faster' becomes a pleasure in and of itself, and a thing to be cherished.:::1:::4/5
It's as fun as it sounds, but only up to a point.:::0:::C+
This is not some amped-up rock 'em sock'em rollercoaster ride. Instead, director George Tillman Jr. wants to explore the darker, more psychologically destructive side of revenge:::1:::3.5/5
As films of this genre go, Faster is a middle-of-the-road offering, but those expecting something fast-paced and frenetic are likely to be disappointed.:::0:::2.5/4
There are a couple of plot twists that -- carefully seeded into the story -- are intended to shock and surprise but actually come across as contrived and highly implausible.:::0:::2/4
Self-parody could have worked here, had it been handled smartly. The core elements to the story are solid; the execution of them is not.:::0:::2/5
The script by Tony Gayton and Joe Gayton isn't really a vehicle for Johnson; it's more of a three-headed narrative that keeps knocking heads.:::0:::2/4
This misfired actioner marks Dwayne Johnson's return to muscle movies, this time without any measurable humor.:::0:::None
A throwback to the '70s -- straight action with a few clever twists, all anchored by solid characters actors:::1:::None
Trying to marry a stylish B-movie revenge actioner to a more thoughtful exploration of forgiveness and guilt, Faster ends up a well-intentioned muddle.:::0:::None
The Rock's born again bad guy with a good heart propels this meaty plot to the edge and back as a formidable screen presence. And one who can impressively multitask terror and tenderness in smooth succession, who knew.:::1:::None
It's assembly-line junk right down to its glaringly obvious twist ending.:::0:::2/5
Tillman brings out the best in The Rock, a performer whose presence can outweigh his acting chops.:::1:::None
The movie is in such a hurry that it doesn't bother to slow down for proper names, instead referring to its main characters as archetypes.:::0:::None
Hardcore, but also heavily flawed action flick. Johnson seems to be playing a supporting role in his own movie.:::0:::5/10
Packed with unexpected stillness and a number of tough, adrenaline-boosting action sequences, Faster is cool and crisp where movies like Salt are just loud and dumb.:::1:::3.5/5
Whatever brownie points Tillman scored with "Notorious", "Faster" is that wake-up call that he's no John Woo.:::0:::1.5/4
[Faster is] one of those better-than-it-needs-to-be examples of a genre that could easily cross over to a larger audience as well.:::1:::None
Faster is also furious.:::1:::None

The limited time given to each of the short films means that there is little opportunity to get really down and dirty with the number-crunching, so that for every aspect that is fascinating there is an attendant frustration.:::1:::3/5
A lighthearted plea to the audience to try to think outside the box when it comes to matters of causality.:::1:::7/10
A real hodgepodge of ideas and themes, directed by six different directors, it lacks cohesion. It does, however, have some interesting segments.:::1:::B
Moderately interesting documentary.:::1:::B-

Levitt and Dubner often talk about the importance of giving incentives to customers. It's not clear if this film gives quite enough of them to those people who've already bought the book.:::1:::3/5
Merely proves that a batch of bite-sized featurettes does not automatically add up to a satisfying meal.:::0:::2/5
...an enjoyable, lightweight affair that plays like the pilot for a premium cable series - something like a less raucous version of the Penn & Teller's Showtime series:::1:::86/100

Freakonomics is, much like the book that spawned it, a breezy entertainment that leaves you with a lot to think about.:::1:::3/4
On this take from a statistician whose days are, um, numbered: the docu-omnibus engages, as we wonder what the next filmmaker might do. Proving Levitt's theory that incentives do indeed matter.:::1:::8/10
If you didn't read the book, you can get a less-satisfying version of it here, but you'd be better off hitting the book. And if you did read the book, the movie is superfluous.:::0:::2/4
The film makes some potentially dull material come to life, but it's a tad pleased with itself for delivering that small gift.:::1:::B
When this freakumentary hooks up with Urail King, it gets an A.:::1:::None
It's intellectual snack food, satisfying for a little while but always leaving you hungry for more.:::0:::2.5/4
This 93-minute collection of short films finds an innovative way to pursue trivial data. It makes the often vague and elusive subject of economics interesting. It should encourage more viewers to read the book.:::1:::2.5/4
The film is provocative but also scattershot and not nearly as conclusive as it pretends to be.:::1:::B-
Blame producer Chad Troutwine for bringing together an array of talented documentary filmmakers to try to coax life into material certainly not suited to the medium of film.:::0:::2/4
An unusual cinematic experiment that comes off as a hit-and-miss collection of appetizers.:::0:::C
A mixed bag...often comes across as simply cute, pushing very hard to too little effect.:::0:::C+
Sometimes, it has all the answers. More often, it just asks the right questions. And in today's 24-hour froth of insta-pundit analysis, we need curiosity more than certainty.:::1:::B
Some parts of the movie are more satisfying and intriguing than others, but there are enough surprising and non-intuitive revelations that even the most jaded viewer will likely learn a thing or two.:::1:::3/4
A learning-is-fun . . .anthology . . .with more pluses than minuses, [it] is as entertaining as it's educational and enlightening.:::1:::6/10
It's probably inevitable that some segments work better than others, and it's fortunate that executive producer and co-director Seth Gordon does a nice job of tying the whole thing together.:::1:::3/5
The movie version of Freakonomics functions as a reasonably effective trailer, but for a book whose moment has already passed.:::1:::None
Equal parts journalistic expose and targeted anthropological dissection, the slick anthology production Freakonomics makes heavy ideas go down easy.:::1:::None
Has lost some of its cumulative mojo in translation, partly because after seven years the pot is pretty well stirred, and partly because the medium demands narrative focus.:::1:::6.5/10
Engaging economic docu is too complex for young kids.:::1:::3/5
It's mild stuff indeed, more like an especially lightweight edition of 60 Minutes than a hard-hitting expose of cultural ills.:::0:::None
Freakonomics's four sections offer various takes on the source book's premise: what happens when you ask "a different kind of question entirely"?:::1:::None
There is more material here to chew on than in a dozen other documentaries combined. And that's a good thing. No?:::1:::3/5
There's an appealing sort of crazy, on the surface, to Freakonomics... [But it] sounds for all the world as if [the film] is mocking Freakonomics [the theory].:::0:::None
A disjointed mess that is never quite as hip or smart as it seems to think it is.:::0:::None
As with any omnibus film, it offers a little of a lot...gives each filmmaker enough room to expand beyond simple ideas into something more complex.:::1:::None
Amiably passes the time.:::1:::3/5
An interesting, uneven mountain of stats and facts that, overall, is inconclusive.:::0:::C+
A movie for those of you who like to fill out the crossword puzzle or play Sudoku daily:::1:::3/4
[It] isn't freaky enough.:::0:::1.5/4
It cannot and should not be expected to give us the answers we want (or any at all, for that matter). The point of the field of Levitt and Dubner's study is to ask the right questions.:::1:::3/4
...this movie perverts the basis of the book, since many of the answers it draws are based on bald conjecture and semi-staged scenes rather than fact.:::0:::0/10
...while the resulting film is often entertaining, it's also random, it's ideas not well articulated.:::0:::C+
Freakonomics examines social, cultural, and financial issues with an eye to getting people to think differently.:::1:::3/4
An attempt to turn the 2005 nonfiction bestseller into a high-energy docu-romp, "Freakonomics'' is a misconceived botch.:::0:::1.5/4
Like the 2005 bestseller that inspired it, the movie version of Freakonomics is fleet and accessible, an enjoyably light and lively pop artifact aimed at bringing some unusual economic theories to the masses.:::1:::B-
hardly lives up to its promise, or even its title.:::0:::2.5/5
This enjoyable if uneven anthology documentary manages to break even, with two strong segments making up for two weaker ones.:::1:::None
At the center is the quietly exciting notion that numbers can be used to both mask the truth and reveal it, depending on the character of who's holding the calculator.:::1:::3.5/5
Succeeds in provoking thoughts about ethics, pop culture, and human nature, and that isn't an easy thing to do.:::1:::3/5
As a movie, Freakonomics is like Jujubes for the brain -- it starts to get cloying halfway through the box.:::0:::C+
An iconoclastic expose' featuring fresh cultural slants apt to leave the average armchair economist reevaluating a lot of conventional wisdom they've taken for granted.:::1:::3/4
Schlock.:::0:::2/4
Any movie that triggers creative thought in its audience can't be that bad a deal.:::1:::3/5
There's no chance to get into anything in depth, because it's onto the next broadly sketched out concept.:::0:::2.5/4
The 20-minute shorts range in style from traditional fly-on-the-wall narrative to a kind of hyperactive PowerPoint presentation.:::0:::None
A really innovative way to explore a potentially boring subject like economics in a way that mass audiences can understand and appreciate.:::1:::8/10
While not as thoroughly informative or entertaining as it could have been under the control of a single director, "Freakonomics" is a thought-provoking documentary that keeps you wanting more.:::1:::B-
By the end, don't be surprised if you are still asking yourself what, exactly, the definition of freakonomics is.:::0:::2/4
It's not always entirely successful on its own terms, but it's entertaining and thought-provoking enough to stand alone as a reflection of Levitt and Dubner's book.:::1:::6.5/10
With different filmmakers handling each segment, some obviously work better than others, but either way it is the book.:::1:::None
The cast is strong and the irregular structure works perfectly. Welcome back, Mr. Reiner.:::1:::3.5/5
A beautifully crafted and special movie, one likely to stay with you long after most of the so-called summer blockbusters have faded into memory.:::1:::4.5/5
Funny, fresh and totally engaging, it's a nostalgic gem.:::1:::8/10
Could be one of the great films. I mean one of THE great films. I wish I could have seen it when I was a kid, before I learned everything the hard way.:::1:::None
... rich, warm and wonderful ...:::1:::5/5
It's Reiner's best film in a decade ... but just look at the competition...:::1:::2.5/4
I can't say anything nice about Flipped, a painfully clumsy adaptation of a tween novel by Wendelin Van Draanen.:::0:::None
Flipped is the kind of small, special movie that wraps you up in so much warmth, humor and humanity that it will leave you wishing that stories like this weren't so rare.:::1:::4/5
Flipped is sweet but unsubstantial, kinda like puppy love itself.:::0:::C+
Flipped is sweet and something like honest, heartfelt and phonily sincere, and it will be, at risk of coarse honesty, catnip for old people.:::1:::3/5
Reiner, in very broad strokes, works in issues of poverty, thwarted dreams and family obligation, and almost pulls it off.:::0:::None
It's great to see Rob Reiner make a film that is every inch as warm and human and enjoyable as the films he made his name with in the early part of his career.:::1:::None
A somewhat leaden piece of work, its considerable charms nearly smothered by strange pacing and awkward staging.:::0:::None
Reiner again demonstrates compassion and insight into young people's battles to acquire self-knowledge, but in his new film, too many clearly fictional characters and contrived situations bog down his story.:::0:::None
:::0:::C-
Reinterpretation of The Snow Queen, Hans Christian Andersen's classic fairytale as an animated, female empowerment musical.:::1:::4/4
Energy thaws kid-friendly Frozen:::1:::None
Green avoids Hatchet's corny cliches and totally redeems himself with a harrowing portrait of humans at the mercy of the great outdoors.:::1:::4/5
Characters possess serious lack of thinking ability and survival skills. Even when it comes to stuff like zipping up their coats all the way.:::0:::2/5
Adam Green's fun 2006 horror film Hatchet revelled in the art of self-aware pastiche, but it is in his second major work that he has found a legitimately great concept out of which to wring more nuanced thrills.:::1:::3/5
The parts of the film that work are flat-out fantastic. There just aren't enough of them.:::0:::6/10
Like Jack London's 'To Build a Fire,' this is an exercise in extracting suspense from the circumstances of a harsh wintry environment and a bad situation rather than imposing danger in the form of an outside (and potentially vanquishable) foe.:::1:::3/4
Green?s nifty framing, dawning-dread pacing, and fixation on corporeal deterioration proves sturdy.:::1:::B-
The characters, situation, and dialogue are stretched a bit thin.:::0:::2/5
While making the occasional narrative misstep, this is effective low-budget filmmaking, and undoubtedly a notch better than what usually passes as suspense these days.:::1:::B+
The movie has a good flow, and it understands how to generate thrills, but the characters, situation and dialogue are stretched a bit thin.:::0:::2.5/4
Green orchestrates all this with some skill but not too much gore. A minor tour de force.:::1:::3/5
However much fun it is to watch, it's a lot more fun to pull it apart afterwards.:::1:::3/5
Sustains interest and tension with some inventive plotting and gratuitous misfortune, aided by a cast convincingly scared witless, even if their characters left me, well, rather cold.:::1:::3/5
Armed with an appealingly pared-down premise, Frozen effectively establishes itself as one of the best horror films of its kind to come around since Open Water.:::1:::3.5/4
Impressively directed and genuinely suspenseful, this is a hugely entertaining thriller with a superb script and terrific performances from its three leads.:::1:::4/5
This minimalist thriller offers the same endurance-test nightmare as Open Water, only here the imperilled characters are marooned on a mountain, and wolves substitute for the sharks.:::1:::3/5
Fiendish, sweaty and tense as hell. One to watch through the fingers.:::1:::4/5
With believable characters, a real sense of terror and that terrific whatwould-you-do? plot, Frozen works on every level. A proper chiller.:::1:::5/5
The taut set-up is enjoyable all by itself, but it's the rising tide of three-way recriminations and despair that gives this film emotional clout.:::1:::4/5
It's a stunt film that only just overcomes the challenge it's set itself.:::1:::2/5
Three teenagers stranded on a ski lift doesn't sound like the most enthralling concept for a thriller, but writer/director Adam Green (Hatchet) takes the idea to nail-chomping heights.:::1:::3/5
Green choreographs the dangling trio from a multitude of intriguing angles, showing a keen eye for moody menace and compelling gruesomeness.:::1:::3/5
Taut and tense, it's an effective suspence-horror.:::1:::3/5
Adam Green's taut, toe-curling survival thriller is better than it should be: the concept and the characters' behaviour are mostly plausible, the script is dark and funny, the acting is adequate, and the wildlife scenes are convincing.:::1:::3/5
With a better-than-average script and performances, there are a couple of startling moments and good use of just one location.:::1:::4/5
The amount of preposterous coincidences that lead to the precarious predicament of the three muppets and their continued suffering also robs Frozen of any remote credibility.:::0:::2/5
What would you do, suspended 40 feet above hard-packed snow, with only the wolves for company if you dare to jump?:::1:::4/5
Characters are expertly manoeuvred to their various fates with an emotional wallop that offsets the flashes of blood and gore the director allows.:::1:::4/5
A film that's nearly a masterpiece and one that will not send you off with a giggle or a grin believing in the power of the human spirit...:::1:::None
Considerando a premissa limitada, o diretor Adam Green merece aplausos por manter certo ritmo na narrativa apesar da falta de inteligencia de seus personagens.:::1:::3/5
Perfect movie to enjoy with friends, not because it's too frightening to see solo, but because it evokes a WTF/OMG reaction that's awkward to share that with a stranger.:::1:::3.5/5
It takes an extraordinary amount of patience to tolerate this picture, and an even greater suppression of basic survival logic to enjoy it.:::0:::D
There's not enough here for 90 minutes.:::0:::None
Both the audience and the characters are stuck in their chairs waiting and waiting and waiting and...:::0:::None
"Frozen" is a suspense thriller that's better than it deserves to be, but still not as good as it should be.:::1:::B-
Preposterous by the end, but Green provides enough formal polish to the film to make it at least partially engaging.:::1:::2.5/4
February or not, Frozen already has a reserved spot as one of the year's best pictures.:::1:::3.5/4
Frozen proves you don't need serial killers or supernatural shocks to keep us entertained. Man vs. Mother Nature will suffice.:::1:::3/4
Frozen is good for five minutes of "What would you do if?" games. Then it's just stiff as a board.:::0:::1/5
A stuck chairlift just doesn't exert the same primal terror as a roiling sea, and to make up the difference, Green would need a better cast and sharper dialogue than he has here.:::0:::None
Most popsicles have more layers than the characters in Frozen.:::0:::2.5/5
In those moments when we (and the characters) are paralyzed between bad decisions, we're as stiff with tension as an icicle.:::1:::3/5
Another date movie-horror flick designed to scare tentative couples into each other's arms.:::0:::2/4
Tthe script is clunky, the acting strained. Too bad. Underlying the life-and-death thriller are notions about the ways coupledom changes and challenges friendships.:::0:::1.5/4
It is a simple story but one that director Green handles well for the bulk of the film, only falling flat in the finale.:::1:::C+
Allows one to hold out hope for what Green does next. Perhaps next time he'll make it up the mountain instead of getting halfway there.:::0:::None
Frozen features a persuasive performance by Shawn Ashmore as one of the bratty skiers and plenty of evidence that, in the long term, trying to skip out on lift tickets is not a good plan.:::1:::2.5/4
The performances and what passes for dialogue -- mostly extended bickering and screaming -- are so lackluster that it's hard to care about the fate of this trio for long.:::0:::1.5/4
Green ably creates the tension of expected and inevitable consequences...forcing the audience to imagine how difficult it would be to survive.:::1:::None
Taking a dramatic turn from the slasher hilarity of his breakthrough feature Hatchet, writer/director Green plays it straight with a script that has the virtue of simplicity.:::1:::3.5/4
Adam Green's Frozen explores a tiny idea exhaustively, and I mean exhaustively.:::0:::None
A nifty little chiller that balances its cold terrain with an unexpectedly warm heart.:::1:::4/5
The threesome's constant conversation amid the building unease helps establish them as characters with which the audience can identify.:::1:::3/5
Will Adam Green make a great, iconic movie eventually? In time, perhaps. I don't think we do him any favors to claim he already has...but I will say that FROZEN is a step in the right direction.:::1:::None
don't plan on taking any ski trips afterwards:::1:::8/10
The brain is far more afraid of the possible than the impossible, and Green knows this:::1:::4/5
Green's minimalist setting and conflict put everything under a microscope. The contrivances, while minor in a different situation, are relatively huge here.:::0:::2/4
It wants to be a real chiller, but comes out curiously lukewarm.:::0:::C-
I'd be more up in arms about the lapses in logic if I felt the film were more deserving of my passions.:::0:::C-
The film moves along, in its paradoxically static way, at a pretty fair clip. I look forward to Green's follow-up.:::1:::2.5/4
The excess of conversation never succeeds at humor, but it does make us hate the characters, whose speech seems to have just two modes: bickering and whining.:::0:::1.5/4
What makes Frozen really work is the way that the characters react to their predicament.:::1:::8.5/10
An entertaining, suspense-filled, sometimes wonderfully grotesque little scarefest.:::1:::3/4
I seriously doubt I will cavalierly take to a ski lift ever again.:::1:::3/4
All three of the leads are very good.:::1:::None
You'll definitely recall this freezing flick the next time you go skiing. For the next 15 years or so.:::1:::None
Green also has some excellent ideas about how to torment his characters.:::1:::B-
I love the straightforward gall of Frozen. Here's a horror film that's confident enough to abandon superficial scares in favor of a far more insidious, intellectual concept:::1:::3/4
starts off really well, but just as the characters' first action to save themselves is abrupt, so too is the ending, which does little but repeat what has come before and tack on yet another horror ending cliche.:::0:::C+
Where are the flying Saint Bernards when you really need them?:::0:::1/4
Most of the movie consists of petty bickering between the characters. And screenwriter/director Adam Green's dialogue in these scenes in awful.:::0:::1.5/4
Frozen has its work cut out for it, since the main characters are so annoying you initially pray for an avalanche to just get it over with.:::0:::2/4
Green definitely knows his way around a suspense sequence, but he needs to find a way to work those sequences into a movie that has its own organic life, and isn't so... well, please refer back to the title.:::0:::C+
An unremarkable addition to the 'Jeez, hope that doesn't happen to me' genre.:::0:::2.5/5
This chilly thriller from Adam Green (Hatchet) starts with a nifty premise and goes nowhere from there.:::0:::C+
Perhaps it's because the wind chill as I write is minus-11 degrees, but this just isn't entertainment I can warm up to.:::0:::2.5/4
Green certainly gets what he pays for regarding his performers, a uniformly bland bunch not talented enough to strike ironic notes of vapidity.:::0:::2/5
Calm and jaded as I am, I was left so paralyzed with terror by this movie that I chewed a whole pencil in half watching it.:::1:::None
Green also can't maintain the suspension of disbelief necessary as we watch three charmlessly written characters bicker and attempt inane ideas.:::0:::None
These three are so dull the story might have had more spark and tension had Green stranded three strangers aloft on a frozen chairlift.:::0:::None
Since the plot literally has nowhere to go, Frozen is basically a waiting game.:::0:::None
Frozen is horrifying and brutal at times but without ever losing sight of important things like creating characters you really care about whether they live or die.:::1:::7.5/10
With a different set of shivers sent up and down collective audience spines, you're there in that chairlift with those doomed humans whether you like it or not, dying every inch of the way with them.:::1:::None
It's the audience which may be left feeing stranded by the film's wobbly characterizations and drawn-out drama.:::0:::None
McKoen shows an evocative, emotional style with her first feature, which grows from an internalised, psychological drama into a thriller without ever kicking into a higher gear.:::1:::3/5
Frozen delivers enough thrills and gory chills to satisfy the horror film crowd, but is not written, directed or acted well enough to be a first-rate thriller.:::0:::None
Writer-director Adam Green effectively blends the acrophobic setup with the attendant psychological dimensions and the actors give credible performances.:::1:::3/4
Frozen is quite simply terrifying. It will do for skiing what Jaws dn interesting yet trivial data.:::0:::2.5/5
dds up to a revelatory trip into complex, innovative ideas and altered perspectives on how people think.:::1:::None
Like the source material, it's ultimately less than the sum of its parts -- an assemblage of moderately interesting human interest stories that don't carry much weight on the big screen.:::0:::None
:::0:::None
His sharpest observations are reserved for preternaturally intelligent, hyper-self-conscious outsiders whose existential crises are the failure of the world-and, to some extent, themselves-to live up to their own high expectations.:::1:::None
Stiller succeeds in a dramatic role but the script underwhelms with a meandering story and an unlikable lead character.:::0:::2.0/5
Not the feel-good film of the year, but Greenberg is a powerful account of how a few lost souls can find meaning and direction in life.:::1:::4/5
Obviously there's running commentary from director Noah Baumbach -- his characters are never free of context -- but they don't have epiphanies, they don't learn and they don't apologize. It's kind of refreshing.:::1:::4/5
Baumbach's writing and direction of these characters display more of a novelistic touch...but the approach produces a deeply felt view of flawed individuals.:::1:::B+
Greenberg is not an enjoyable movie, but it's a unique experience that will mostly appeal to cinephiles with insatiable appetites for character-driven small films.:::1:::None
Ben Stiller plays the most repellent character I have ever seen in a movie and that includes "Dracula". If you are going to feature a repellent character, you have to make him or her interesting. Bela Lugosi was a huge success by comparison.:::0:::None
This is more of a character study than it is a real story. The characters in the film are vivid and they make indelible impressions. The acting is excellent all around.:::1:::C+
From the ever-inventive mind of Noah Baumbach comes a deep comedy that seems to combine elements from his last two films.:::1:::3.5/5
A typically low-key effort from Noah Baumbach...:::1:::2.5/4
The engine that drives Greenberg is this tension between the illusion of our outward projection and the absolute loathing of the worms underneath.:::1:::4/4
Baumbach may think he's found a rare happy ending when he puts these two together, but I highly doubt it.:::1:::3/4
Baumbach's movie once again walks a fine line between being off-putting and being fascinating in its character study, and for me the positives win out.:::1:::7/10
Greenberg is inevitably, productively divisive in tone and topical focus-and this in itself strikes me as a good thing-but you cannot say the filmmakers aren't trying to use all the resources available to the form.:::1:::B+
Watching the social and family dynamics play out in this film reveals a whole life lived in these rhythms and traps, which is not always pleasant... but certainly interesting.:::1:::None
Good luck with yourself, Greenberg. But I think I want to break up.:::0:::1.5/4
Far from the usual slapstick laced with smarts comedy, Greenberg is Ben Stiller's Punch Drunk Love.:::1:::4/5
The characters are so socially destructive that it's difficult to care what happens to any of them.:::0:::2.5/5
full review at Movies for the Masses:::0:::2/5
Roger Greenberg is not the kind of guy you want to wind up next to at a dinner party.:::1:::None
A well-made movie filled with authentic moments of humour and insight, If only the central character wasn't such an unlikeable tool.:::1:::3/5
Some viewers will be turned off by this non-Stiller role but I think he's great. He also gets a few quotable lines thanks to writer-director Noah Baumbach.:::1:::B+
Baumbach avoids the tedious or the overstated, always finding a way to raise the stakes, whether it's through an unexpected plot development or a performance.:::1:::None
Baumbach sends his signature brand of familial dysfunction west to Los Angeles in Greenberg, adding another exceptional character portrait to his resume and excavating unseen layers of depth in his leading man.:::1:::4/5
While slightly patchy and too quirky, Ben Stiller is terrific in the lead role and the film is highly watchable, containing a handful of unforgettable moments.:::1:::None
Greenberg is the latest character comedy from writer-director Noah Baumbach (The Squid and the Whale, Margot at the Wedding). For lovers of the genre, it's a real treat.:::1:::None
As a film about two misfits, Greenberg is a bit of a misfit itself: bright, mysterious and not that interested in making friends.:::1:::None
A beautifully concise and sensitive screenplay (co-written with Jennifer Jason Leigh) and insightful direction, inviting us to become involved in the lives of two complex, confused individuals:::1:::None
There's a lot not to like about Greenberg, the character and the film; and yet, by the end, I found it very touching, and the final scene is so imbued with delicacy and humanity that any stumbles along the way can be forgiven.:::1:::4/5
As a study of stasis and of people conscious of not living the lives they had imagined for themselves, the picture offers a bracing undertow of seriousness beneath the deceptively casual, dramatically offhand surface.:::1:::None
Like the director's Kicking and Screaming and Margot at the Wedding, it works as an almost perfect example of a certain kind of American neurosis.:::1:::4/5
Baumbach is capable of brilliant dialogue, and certain scenes have a tidy truthfulness that recall Woody Allen at his pinnacle.:::1:::3/5
There is none of Stiller's usual knockabout comedy -- it is all brilliantly observational.:::1:::4/5
Baumbach (The Squid and the Whale) has a knack for creating clever, tension-laden dialogue that feels authentic, and there's plenty of i.:::1:::3/5
Everybody hurts, all the time, as Ben Stiller aces his dramatic turn in another witty, discomforting comedy drama from Baumbach. No happy endings here, but a climactic note of hope feels hard-earned.:::1:::4/5
Gerwig has an unaffected screen presence that is oddly compelling: a kind of luminous ordinariness:::1:::3/5
Lurching between comedy and agony, Noah Baumbach's new film appears to be the simple tale of a man recovering from a nervous breakdown. Yet Greenberg resonates for days afterwards, like a hangover after a peculiar and fascinating party.:::1:::4/5
See this film for uniformly excellent performances and a beguiling aesthetic, but approach with caution if Manhattan-era Woody Allen drives you up the wall.:::1:::3.5/5
This is a movie about the awful shock of early middle age, the sudden realisation that you are not one of the young people any more. Like a wasp, it delivers a sharp sting of sadness.:::1:::4/5
This is the kind of low-budget movie that attracts respectful reviews, but tiny audiences. That's because there's virtually no story or character development and the main character's an idiot.:::0:::2/5
Are you a movie star nobody takes seriously? Are you fed-up with being cast in dumb comedies? Do you crave the respect of your peers? Then call Noah Baumbach, a director with a knack for extracting good performances from the unlikeliest of places.:::1:::4/5
Baumbach grows up and suggests he's getting better with age.:::1:::4/5
There's a terrific character profile buried within this meandering, awkward film. The actors create superbly rounded people, but the slow pace and seemingly aimless script make it rather maddening to watch.:::0:::2.5/5
Greenberg may be good with wood, but Stiller is pure Polyfilla as he tries to plug the credibility gaps in a messy script which features one of the most ludicrous sex scenes in history.:::0:::2/5
An awkward moment is comedy gold in Ben Stiller's hands and there are plenty of those in Greenberg.:::1:::3/5
Stiller loses his natural comic appeal chasing after the hero's frowns and tics...:::0:::2/5
Old Ben Stiller has returned.:::1:::4/5
It's an intelligent, original piece of work that totally flouts Hollywood formula while delivering killer lines with the sort of casual abandon that suggests a director totally in control of his material.:::1:::3/5
Enjoyable character study from writer-director Noah Baumbach that makes up for its relative lack of plot with a superbly written script and terrific performances from Ben Stiller, Greta Gerwig and Rhys Ifans.:::1:::4/5
Basically, it's great.:::1:::None
Greenberg is a groundbreaking performance for Stiller who's unafraid, it seems, to risk alienating fans of his more mainstream movies like Meet The Fockers.:::1:::None
A film of powerful, memorable moments -- some striking dialogue, some great performances, a handful of beautifully played, bracingly discomfiting love scenes -- in search of a structure and, perhaps, a soul.:::1:::3/5
Like a lot of human relationships Greenberg is complicated, infuriating, good-hearted, funny, often painful, and well worth the effort. A sad little movie but also a great one, lit by two astonishing central performances.:::1:::4/5
It's Gerwig who's the real revelation ... She'll be around for a long time, but you'd be well-advised to get to know her right now.:::1:::3/4
Woody Allen is an influence, but Baumbach's comedy of discomfort is distinctive -- it speaks to the peculiar anxieties of the 'mean' era that produced it.:::1:::3.5/4
I only kind of like it, and I'll probably never want to see it again, but I respect it on some level.:::1:::4/5
Droll humored and observant modern-day relationship psychological comedy/drama.:::1:::A-
Detest may not be a strong enough word to express what surely ranks as the worst movie of 2010. If you choose to ignore this warning, you may want to jump off a cliff after seeing this debacle for yourself:::0:::.5/4
Noah Baumbach again investigates psychologically screwed-up people, although this time with much less comedic impact.:::0:::None
We can care about irritating characters, sure. But not this one.:::0:::2.5/4
...in some ways a very funny movie, although I'm not sure you could call it comedy ... This is an actors' movie, and the characters portrayed here are authentic, at least to my experience.:::1:::86/100
"Greenberg" succeeds mostly because its characters and story are much more interesting, and Baumbach left the toilet-cam at home this time.:::1:::4/5
Through the casual pacing of the script and Harris Savides' gloriously brumous cinematography, Greenberg becomes more about other people's interpretations of Roger than the man himself.:::1:::3.5/4
The storytelling may not always be sharp enough, but director Noah Baumbach's vision of a Los Angeles where people with dreams slowly age into bland irrelevance is spot-on.:::1:::None
You may well identify with Roger's relentless irritation. But you probably won't like it.:::0:::None
Jason Leigh's acting-writing teaming with Baumbach is just as exciting as Stiller's triumphant return to the neurotic kingdom. Misery loves company.:::1:::None
A funny and observant movie that's quite absorbing and entertaining:::1:::3.5/4
Baumbach's misanthropy may have become shtick by this point, but he keeps returning to the same mode because he's so unbelievably good at it.:::1:::8/10
The movie labors long, but realistically so, before finding hints of light in a very long tunnel.:::1:::2.5/4
As a portrait of self-obsession, Greenberg has its moments but the film never gives us sufficient reason to care about Roger...:::0:::4/10
While "Greenberg" wasn't as funny as I had hoped, I think it's a great film and in the end is a return to form for Baumbach.:::1:::3.5/5
Stiller is expert at playing self-indulgent types unaware of their boorishness, and Greenberg is no exception.:::1:::3.5/5
The only thing that stops it from being completely oppressive is Greta Gerwig's wonderfully believable performance as the awkward, much younger woman whom Roger alternately woos and rejects.:::1:::B
Writer-director Noah Baumbach is hilariously acute in his observation of Generation X in the early autumn of its years.:::1:::3.5/4
The glib stabs at Jean Eustache-like candor from The Squid and the Whale and Margot at the Wedding don't get any less hollow by being transplanted to California:::0:::None
It is always difficult to care for a film with a central character who is whiney, self-centered, and pathetic. This movie and Greenberg the character are no exception.:::0:::3/10
A film that stays with you if you stay with it.:::1:::3.5/5
What saves it, however, is Gerwig. The love story ain't credible, but her performance is, perfectly capturing a young woman who doesn't lack confidence so much as a sense of self.:::1:::3/4
Greenberg doesn't amount to much, really, but it's an enjoyably amusing character study with plenty of little pleasures.:::1:::3/4
In many ways this is Baumbach's best film, filled with his bitter but often funny misanthropic perspective, but buoyed by the undeniable likability of Stiller and Gerwig.:::1:::A-
Unhealthy relationship is focus of darkly funny adult drama.:::1:::3/5
Failed artists -- more specifically, failed writers -- play a central role in most of Noah Baumbach's films. In Greenberg, Baumbach embraces that failure.:::1:::None
Greenberg plays a lot like mature mumblecore (which is to say that it has a plot and a script), with a familiar theme: It is ultimately your relationships that define you.:::1:::3/4
The movie is set up as a quirky romance between two lost souls, but in the end it seems more like a stalemate than a love match.:::0:::2/5
Baumbach reminds us, like golden-days Mazursky did, of the aching elusiveness but absolute essentialness of human connection.:::1:::3.5/5
In L.A., if you squint your eyes just right, it's not all that hard to imagine that the house that you're tending may very well be your own. Yet in the harsh delineation of Greenberg, we're squinting for a whole other reason.:::0:::4.5/10
As well-acted and sporadically charming as Greenberg is, Baumbach's consumption with misery keeps Stiller's character, and the film named for him, from being likable.:::0:::2.5/4
Baumbach proves he's as good as anyone at producing the kind of laughter that sticks in your throat.:::1:::None
The movie has the easy, unforced feel of the temporary timeout in life that Roger himself has embarked on. The script is full of funny, observant lines.:::1:::3/4
The movie ends on strange note, almost as if even Baumbach couldn't stand to spend one more minute with the odious Greenberg.:::0:::2.5/4
After several movies' worth of glib overacting, Stiller is more exposed and vulnerable here than he has ever been on film.:::1:::3/4
Baumbach is as perceptive about aimlessness as he is adept at offhandedness; whether these gifts are ideally complementary may have to remain an open question.:::1:::3/5
It's Stiller's job here to indicate why Greenberg isn't merely repulsive, and on that count he succeeds.:::1:::B
It's mostly all doom and gloom. Fans of Baumbach have come to expect that from him lately, but is it so much to ask for a good story and some likeable characters as well?:::0:::2.5/5
Does well by its hurt and hurtful hero.:::1:::3/4
Parental Content Review:::0:::None
Movies about insufferable people don't have to be insufferable themselves, but when a tangible arc is lacking and no credible change is made in who they are from beginning to end, the viewer is left to question what, exactly, the point is.:::0:::2/4
Though "Greenberg" recalls"Annie Hall" at times, it is crucially different. Allen has an essentially comic view of existence, although there have been exceptions and his vision has grown darker with age. Baumbach's work has been dark from the start and ar:::1:::B+
Baumbach may paint miniatures, but his films are anything but quaint. They're as unsettling as meeting a harmless but difficult stranger.:::1:::3/4
It's a character study that builds slowly to a few pointed moments of karmic awakening, not all of which are ennobling. And it's played with uncanny intensity by Stiller, who has almost no vanity.:::1:::B
Even among the cavalcade of finks and egoists that populate Baumbach's body of work, Greenberg is a doozy.:::0:::1.5/4
A comedy that is so cozily Zen that its subdued laughs might qualify as relaxation exercises.:::1:::3/4
Greenberg won't be everyone's cup of hemlock. Yet we all know people like this -- the ones who only hear their own motors running -- and Baumbach locates and mines a rich vein of appalled comic sympathy.:::1:::3/4
Stiller's portrayal is so acutely real, Baumbach's writing so cutting and specific, and the work of Gerwig so seemingly effortless that Greenberg makes you, if not happy to stick around, then at least agreeable to the idea.:::1:::3.5/4
At times, you'd swear the movie was improvised -- especially judging by the clumsy, contrived and slapped-together third act.:::0:::2/4
Stiller plays a monster, and when Gerwig goes for him, declaring that she sees his tender side, the development seems like a fond indulgence on the part of writer-director Noah Baumbach.:::0:::None
Ben Stiller, Greta Gerwig and Rhys Ifans all shine, but the question is: How long can you stand to hangout with the annoying Roger Greenberg?:::1:::B
Greenberg may not win any popularity contests, but for fans of risk-taking cinema, it's most likely to succeed.:::1:::3/4
Ben Stiller bites reality back:::1:::A
The dramedy is richly written and Stiller's acting delivers, though his unlikable narcissist may put off audiences. The big discovery, however, is Gerwig, whose dreamy blonde -- lost in a post-college haze -- comes off earthy and instantly appealing.:::1:::3/4
Cinematographer Harris Savides captures the relentless, rather terrifying sunniness of LA without ignoring the smog. Baumbach's script and direction has brought out the best in everyone on-screen.:::1:::4/4
I never knew who Ben Stiller was born to play, but now I do.:::1:::3.5/4
Baumbach doesn't have much to offer besides the comfort of malaise, which dilutes the gravity, making the film's uncompromising attitude almost predictable.:::0:::C+
Finds room for feeling among the anger ... Blooms into a study of relatable people, not just Baumbach's own issues.:::1:::3.5/5
How patient you'll be depends a lot on how you feel about Ben Stiller, the reigning icon of squirm-inducing weaselly boorishness. What can I say? I love the guy.:::1:::3/4
As unlikable as Roger is, Stiller finds a way to make you see past his bitterness and sympathize with his aimlessness. You don't like him, but you feel his pain.:::1:::3/4
Noah Baumbach rebounds in a big way with Greenberg, a brilliant triumph for all involved.:::1:::4/5
True to this chauvinistic genre, Gerwig is a vacuum who lives to serve the house, the man and the mechanics of Baumbach's script.:::0:::D
Ben Stiller uses his rather large cranium to host his character's immense ego like a sun he believes all others orbit.:::1:::B+
Greenberg would be a heckuva movie if we could just get Greenberg out of there.:::0:::None
Love is just a screech away as Ben Stiller bares the soul of a crazy man who seems to like it that way.:::0:::4/10

A bore. No story. About a narcissistic, mean-spirited, depressed 40 year old.:::0:::None
The funniest and saddest movie Mr. Baumbach has made so far, and also the riskiest.:::1:::4/5
A lot like spending time with friends of friends that are amusing, maybe even fascinating, but ultimately really annoying:::0:::C
Overmedicated, and squeezing lemonade out of far too many lemons. And though there are a few upbeat surprises like a post-operative get well burger, periodic dramatic CPR is highly recommended slouching towards the credits. Pass the Prozac.:::0:::None
Stiller gives an affecting performance...his best dramatic turn yet.:::1:::B+
Greenberg will do a lot for Stiller's reputation and Gerwig's profile, but its awkward, messy humanity and uncomfortable honesty won't necessarily do a lot for ticket-buyers more used to lighter, warmer and breezier entertainments.:::1:::3.5/5
Greenberg scintillates with intelligence, razor's-edge humor and austere empathy for its struggling lovers.:::1:::None
To really pull off Greenberg would require a lead performance from a master actor. The actor it stars is...Ben Stiller.:::0:::2.5/4
Greenberg is a nasty neurotic. Florence is a passive victim. If you're looking for someone to identify with -- well, pray you don't find one here.:::0:::2/4
The movie has the curious vagueness of intent that makes so many "meaningful" works of fiction not all that meaningful.:::0:::None
it has a few quiet, subtle, satisfying moments that sneak up on you from around and between the dialogue, and they make the movie worth pondering.:::1:::2.5/4
Gerwig is striking in the role of the unlikely ingenue, her face anid for swimming.:::1:::4.5/5
[Writer/director Adam] Green has crafted a potent combination of absolute terror and compelling human drama that will stick with you long after you've left the theatre or turned off the DVD.:::1:::4.5/5
:::0:::2/5
Eastwood fails to infuse any moments of suspense or heart into the story and when all is said and done, Hereafter is an anticlimactic, sleepy and momentum-less mess of a film.:::0:::3/10
This movie isn't about anything. This emperor is wearing no clothes.:::0:::C-
Clint Eastwood's late life/late career fascination with mortality, death and grieving devolves, at long last, into a cheap parlor trick in Hereafter.:::0:::1.5/4
Superficially satisfying but oftentimes disappointing, "Hereafter" focuses on three major stories, one of which works far better than the other two.:::1:::3.0/5
A terrific, albeit dreary, character drama that directly addresses one of humanity's most enduring mysteries.:::1:::3.5/5
Before long, the afterlife starts to sound pretty damn appealing.:::0:::1/5
Thankfully, there is light at the end of the tunnel. Just don't expect any grand revelations before the curtain falls.:::1:::3/5
...The filmmakers choose a period setting for their film, then dispense with it part way into the story, once it's become a hindrance to the interests of the corporate sponsors...:::0:::None
...an engaging, sporadically enthralling drama that ranks as one of Eastwood's better efforts as of late.:::1:::3.5/4
Earnestly heartfelt all the way, this movie goes bonkers right out of the gate and doesn't let up until the final shot of Damon having a vision of his own future, so don't worry if you find yourself giggling.:::0:::1/5
Hereafter can't quite make up its mind what it is exactly about, resulting in a film that builds and builds and builds ... to nothing.:::0:::6/10

...an honest attempt to explore the single greatest mystery of life...with intelligence, open-mindedness, understanding, and compassion.:::1:::7/10
full review at Movies for the Masses:::1:::3/5
All in all, a disappointment from Mr Eastwood.:::0:::5/10
Dull and unmoving, Hereafter offers little more than cop out resolutions to its supernatural themes, and a lack of testicular fortitude in its refusal to utter the words "Heaven" or "God".:::0:::2/5
What is terrific about Eastwood is that he has a real cleanness in his approach to filmmaking and there isn't this claptrap of sentimentality surrounding it.:::1:::3.5/5
In the end, an elevating and in many ways, exceptional experience.:::1:::3.5/5
Hereafter is worth taking seriously because, finally, it's about taking care to live decently -- not piously, or proudly, but honestly, in the here and now.:::1:::3/5
This melancholy tale - not so much about the afterlife as about its teasingly morbid lure on three people in different countries - is far from director Clint Eastwood's best, and comes with a particularly dull performance from Matt Damon.:::0:::2.5/5
Now powering through his 80s, Clint Eastwood is doing the best, most thoughtful work of his career.:::1:::3.5/5
An unusual but absolutely absorbing work which bravely tackles the big questions with thoughtfulness and real emotion.:::1:::None
Hereafter asks for no such leaps of faith. It offers no poignancy or spirit; merely an obtuse interpretation of the never-never, book-ended with shrugs.:::0:::2/5
It is sincere, well-meaning and, I'm sorry to say, quite transparent hokum.:::0:::1/5
With Eastwood stubbornly determined to make one of the quietest films you'll ever see and Matt Damon restrained like never before, the Hereafter could either leave you thinking...or seriously underwhelmed.:::1:::3/5
So ridiculous was Hereafter that I laughed out loud several times at the ill thought-out, quasi-spiritualist philosophy it vomited from the screen.:::0:::2/5
All of the strands are weak in their own ways, but the film at least would have had redemptive moments if it wasn't structured so badly.:::0:::2/5
A baby-brained meditation on the afterlife, it's a cosmic catastrophe, the kind of New Age nonsense a schoolkid might write before realising what a crock of hooey it was and binning it.:::0:::1/5
Has no narrative thrust and nothing profound to say, although it's mostly well acted and features some diverting locations, including a good deal of south London.:::0:::2/5
This is a consoling, romantic, inspirational movie in the mid-1940s manner of Portrait of Jennie and A Guy Named Joe.:::1:::None
Psychic Damon says: "A life that's all about death is no life". We say: A film that's all about death is no film.:::0:::1.5/4
Hereafter tries to do what Crash did but without the superficial gloss, the charm or actors who can actually act. The result is desperately, eye-achingly drab.:::0:::1.5/5
Eastwood's weepy depiction of the 'here' is just as dull and tedious as his superficial exploration of the 'after'.:::0:::2/5
Life, death, the beyond... Ah, the beyond. Such a minefield for respectable filmmakers.:::0:::1/5
A thoughtful and sensitive work, and while it may not convince the sceptics that there is something hereafter, it offers something to think about.:::1:::None
Clint Eastwood is the master storyteller, allowing the story to glide as smoothly as silk transcending time and place to hone from the big picture to the individual story:::1:::None
Well, I guess the winning streak had to end sometime.:::0:::None
This is a bewilderingly pointless drama, weaving together three dreary stories about mortality and the afterlife.:::0:::None
Could it be that Peter Morgan's clout gave him the right to dredge up from his desk drawer some terrible old script? Maybe. Either way, it's one to forget for all concerned.:::0:::1/5
Not his finest, but that's proof of how great this man is.:::1:::3/5
Despite stand-out moments both epic and intimate, Clint's latest is a film about death that's likely to put many audiences to sleep.:::0:::2/5
It thoughtfully reflects on how deep sorrow and melancholy can change existence, with both Damon and de France really making their performances count.:::1:::3/5
The start of each story promises so much. Yet the more often we ask "yes, and then?", the less often Morgan and Eastwood stump up a convincing answer.:::0:::2/5
Disappointing drama that's let down by a plodding script, painfully slow pacing, a number of emotional misfires and an atrocious child performance.:::0:::2/5
Slow, ponderous and as shallow as it thinks it is deep, lifted only by an impressive opening and fine work from Damon and Howard.:::0:::2/5
The result may not plumb Shyamalanian awfulness, but if you did get to the afterlife you'd hope they weren't playing this movie.:::0:::2/5
It remains watchable in spite of some rum narrative and performances from kids that woudn't get them a gig as extras on Byker Grove.:::1:::3/5
There I was, trapped in the dark, staring at a piercing light, and feeling the reaper's icy claw fingering my throat. Did I experience the afterlife? No. Just Clint Eastwood's new film about it.:::0:::1/5
Torna-se profundamente autoral nao apesar de suas falhas, mas - vejam so como e o Cinema - justamente em funcao destas.:::0:::2/5
Un film menor en la carrera de Clint Eastwood, que se presenta como una exploracion sobre algunas interrogantes del ser humano pero que, mas alla de cierto interes y un buen nivel general, se queda en la superficie.:::0:::2/5
We get that the story may not be about answers, but the film could have used a lot more interesting, thought-provoking questions along the way.:::0:::C+
Eastwood effectively taps into a well of our common feelings -- fear of death, the numbing shock of being aware of our mortality, and, most largely, the desperate need for closure.:::1:::7/10
My tepidly positive reaction to Hereafter comes as a pretty big surprise, given my feelings about Eastwood's recent work.:::1:::55/100
Out of all this, Eastwood crafts an often beautiful film:::1:::None
Strangely stiff and repetitive.:::0:::None
According to Eastwood and Morgan (who had much better luck with his screenplays on Queen Elizabeth, Idi Amin, and David Frost), people die so two self-indulgent souls can finally find true love while dreadful music plays in the background.:::0:::None
the climatic interweaving of the narrative strands feels profoundly anticlimatic, delivering a modicum of emotional payoff but little else:::0:::2/4
Let me pull out my crystal ball: "Hereafter" is intriguing in a lot of ways, but not a "Million Dollar Baby.":::0:::2.5/5
Has the same effect as an encounter with a phony physic-it keeps delivering just enough to tantalize, never has a real payoff and eventually makes you realize that you've been conned.:::0:::None
Sinks under a kind of glum, watery mood. Neither particularly poignant nor thoughtful about loss or survivors' spiritual search for meaning, the script just bobs along. Always watchable but rarely memorable, the movie fades silently into the light.:::0:::None
"Hereafter" has some quality parts, but ultimately fails because it doesn't really care about what it's supposed to be about.:::0:::1/5
The climax was just as incredulous as Clint's unconvincing look at the hereafter.:::0:::C+
Somber and thought-provoking, 'Hereafter' is a think piece, a serious film that provides no answers but does supply viewers with a lot of 'what ifs.':::1:::3/4
In the film's far-reaching goals, "Hereafter" fails to connect its meticulous plotting together, leaving the second hour unnecessarily tedious and overtly detached from the audience.:::0:::C+
Hereafter is an entertaining film. That said, it would have been even better had it picked any one of the plot strands and focused exclusively on it.:::1:::3/4
Deep into his career, the great American director Clint Eastwood has made a European movie.:::1:::B+
A meandering, pointless disappointment from the normally exceptional Eastwood.:::0:::2/4
Hereafter doesn't feel like a Clint Eastwood film; it's more like a very special edition of John Edward's psychic TV show.:::0:::C
It's hard to get girls when you are a psychic, even if you look like Matt Damon.:::0:::2.25/5
This is a movie that is, at its root, a romance, wrapped up in an 80-year-old master director's musings about what happens to us when we die.:::1:::3.5/4
When it got to the end, it seemed like a lot of effort for not much payoff.:::0:::3/5
The Eastwood magic still works. This is not his best film but it is still a good one.:::1:::7/10
Along with a plodding script, the key character knows what he wants but takes no bold steps to get it. Even Damon appears confused in the movie.:::0:::2.5/5
A few great performances buoy the proceedings, but the laziness of Morgan's script and the overall lack of focus or momentum combine to sink it.:::0:::2.5/5
A finely drawn human drama, it just fails to go far enough with the supernatural elements.:::1:::3/4
Unrelievedly somber and slow, giving a gloomily portentous feel to ideas that aren't nearly as profound as the makers seem to think.:::0:::C
Harry Potter-style hocus pocus only aimed at folks who came of age in the era of the Ouija board.:::0:::1/4
There are no real answers here, strictly more questions, but Eastwood clearly relishes exploring subjects which can be labeled troublesome.:::1:::None
These "interwoven fate" plots often suffer from severe strains of skepticism, but Eastwood keeps things controlled, and --- it never seems contrived.:::1:::None
Like a wasted appointment at a bad psychic's reading room. All the set dressing is there, but it leaves you with an empty, unsatisfied feeling inside.:::0:::1.5/5
With a deliberate pace and some fine performances, this film makes the utterly preposterous seem almost believable. That is quite an achievement in itself. More than that, Eastwood has made this an enjoyable film, which is just as remarkable.:::1:::B
Contains moments of exceptional beauty as well as scenes of intense emotional anguish. I admire Eastwood for taking on another difficult theme and handling it so well.:::1:::None
Damon breathes some life in to this boring film, but he's only in one-third.:::0:::4/10
Factoring in the on location filming in Paris and London, low key dialogue-speak, the multiple plot structure, and long takes, 'Hereafter' has a foreign film look and feel.:::1:::A
Hereafter unfolds with the patience of a good book, a factor likely to turn off more antsy audience members. Yet those who don't flinch at its meditative rhythms will find much to appreciate.:::1:::3/4
Depicted as a bunch of glowing shadows shuffling around in a blue haze, the hereafter might be the world's last smoking lounge.:::0:::2.5/4
What could have been an interesting exploration of the gateway to eternity takes an uncomfortable eternity to get to the point.:::1:::3/5
There's something disarmingly compelling about the story that keeps working despite the rickety framework Eastwood and Morgan have forced upon themselves.:::1:::7/10
Flat lines in less than an hour and doesn't deserve an afterlife on either DVD or cable television. The movie's only strength is the spectacular computer-generated special effects of the tidal waves triggered by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and the...:::0:::1/4

The best scenes in this international project are among the best work Clint Eastwood has ever done.:::1:::None
Here a mature filmmaker at the top of his game muses on life after death. But this is no starry-eyed, gullible wallow in the bathos of eternal bliss.:::1:::3.5/4
I sincerely cannot help but worry, with no snarkiness intended whatsoever, whether Clint Eastwood has gone senile... I can't imagine what else explains the utterly baffling Hereafter.:::0:::None
The film is a deeply compassionate, decidedly secular and somewhat plodding meditation on what matters now and what lies beyond this life.:::1:::3/4
Eastwood and Morgan skillfully and slowly unveil each character's struggles and then send them on their way to inevitable encounters with one another.:::1:::B-
The last 30 minutes of the film hint at what it might have been if someone had whipped that script into shape; the idea of exploring experiences of the afterlife was a great one, and Eastwood certainly has the vision to pull it off.:::1:::3.5/5
Eastwood's filmmaking here is laboriously tasteful and painfully restrained to the point of complete atrophy.:::0:::3.8/10
A Final Destination movie with the air of respectability that Clint Eastwood commands, but absolutely no fun. Clint Eastwood doing Final Destination may sound awesome, but this is a movie just designed to make you feel miserable.:::0:::None
Though I found Hereafter meandering and occasionally sentimental, I couldn't help but admire Clint Eastwood's ambition in taking on-headfirst-the greatest fact of human existence.:::0:::None
I realize it's bad manners to be flip about a movie that emblazons its heart on its sleeve. But Hereafter, soggy with portentous uplift, invites that response.:::0:::C-
Epic filmmaking is not Clint Eastwood's thing.:::0:::None
Hereafter is deep and deliberate. It requires patience and emotional maturity from its audience. Those willing to give it will be rewarded with a cinematic experience that is complex, heartfelt and spiritually uplifting.:::1:::3.5/4
Coincidences and improbabilities aside, the script sometimes borders on the absurd.:::0:::2/4
... at once comforting and unsettling -- both in the best possible way.:::1:::4/5
Who knew conversing with the dead was so much like a visit to the therapist?:::0:::C+
The problematic concept keeps 'Hereafter' earthbound, but the film contains four sequences that affirm Eastwood's mastery, including the opening tsunami, which is not only spectacular but somehow intimate, thanks to the focus on the character of Marie...:::1:::2.5/4
Skeptics and scoffers will find "Hereafter" the funniest film of the year. Others, however, might simply yawn at its pretentious cravings, funereal pace, and murky intentions.:::0:::2/5

Intense drama asks what comes after death.:::1:::3/5
Hereafter features excellent acting and characterizations and deftly avoids being the kind of bore movies about this subject tend to be but doesn't register on a strong enough level to be considered in the upper echelons of the careers of anyone involved.:::1:::7/10
"Hereafter" asks several questions and wisely does not offer any answers. Those, the director and screenwriter leave to the viewer.:::1:::3.5/4
It works best when it stays away from all the preachy overtones of other multi-character dramas like Crash, but it does stumble a bit in an attempt to spell everything out too conveniently.:::1:::2.5/4
After prompting us to seriously ponder life's ultimate question, Eastwood's final answer seems to be: Don't worry about it.:::1:::3/5
Two pounds of story flopping around in a 10-pound bag.:::0:::2/4
A triptych of tales which argue for a stronger editorial hand and the inherent flaw in such a format - all parts of your omnibus better work, or the failures threaten to pull down the successes.:::0:::2.5/5
Hereafter is content to sit back and do nothing - a smart, well directed, well acted nothing.:::1:::6.8/10
Oh for a smarter story, with a brisker pace, to support such excellent talents. At least we still get to experience the good, the bad and, if not the ugly, then the so-so.:::0:::5.5/10
Nothing that happens later in the movie lives up to the inexorable, thundering, power of the tsunami, which makes the under-imagined images of the afterlife thin and tepid.:::1:::B-
It's not that the film's message is wrong as whether we needed two hours of not very interesting stories about not particularly interesting people to get that lesson.:::0:::2/5
Hereafter should have a lot more life, but instead heads mournfully into the white light. Stay away!:::0:::C
Starts off with a shocking, emotional opening scene, but that's the last exciting and interesting thing to happen in the movie.:::0:::1.5/4
Eastwood seems to have become M. Night Shyamalan. It's a good thing, since Shyamalan has been doing such a lousy job of it.:::1:::3/4
Hereafter is the perfect example of an intriguing concept in need of some collaborative brainstorming between a talented writer and a visionary director, followed by a few rewrites.:::0:::1.5/4
Hereafter is a disappointing flick containing great potential that leads to absolutely nothing.:::0:::2.5/5
It's safe to say that, as a director, Clint Eastwood shows no fear.:::1:::3/4
Morgan and Eastwood's depiction of the afterlife repeats the standard cliches, never examining whether the white light and the unintelligible greeting committee stick around for all eternity or are the result of human brain chemistry firing wildly.:::0:::2.5/5
It starts out with a tsunami -- and ends up standing in a puddle.:::0:::2/4
Hereafter isn't about the hereafter so much as it is about those who are left here, after.:::1:::8/10

[Peter] Morgan's script isn't up to his usual standards and [Clint] Eastwood's also off his game.:::0:::C-
Sadly, after the gripping, engaging and emotionally charged roller coaster of an opening, the film ends up fairly lifeless and in the need of a defibrillator to bring it back. (Parental Review also Available):::0:::None
Eastwood shows off filmmaking so fluid and skilled that it makes you weep with joy.:::1:::4/4
Filmed with a master's eye, "Hereafter" continues the streak of outstanding films directed by Clint Eastwood.:::1:::4/4
Not since "Good Will Hunting" has Damon, who also co-starred in Eastwood's real-life 2009 drama "Invictus," been more vulnerable, boyish or sympathetic.:::1:::A-
Feels like the beginning of a discussion, one Eastwood likely has with his peers as they age.:::0:::2.5/4
A lot of dull hooey about mankind's search for answers. Mankind's slow, interminable search for answers.:::0:::C-
One of those movies that works better on a second viewing; it's a gentle, loosely structured tale of lost souls that'll wash away if you let it.:::1:::2.5/4
Eastwood's directorial output, from Mystic River on, constitutes the 21st century's first cinematic marvel, and Hereafter is among the best things he has ever done.:::1:::4/4
Clint Eastwood's gentle, thoughtful film about the fragility of life and the promise of a life beyond.:::1:::3/4
Hereafter, made in the ghostly image of the concept it explores, lingers after it's gone.:::1:::3/4

Forget Dirty Harry -- this might be Clint Eastwood's most controversial and divisive film ever.:::1:::3/4
The finished product so often feels like an early draft of a movie that's in dire need of further revision.:::0:::2/4
Probably Clint Eastwood should not make sentimentalized, epical films about wish fulfillment. But there's Hereafter. It's a film that might make Clint's mentor the late Don Siegel look away.:::0:::1.5/5.0
Hereafter is less concerned with the metaphysics of existence after we die -- contrasted with the CGI playground of The Lovely Bones -- than the earthly tribulations of people still alive who struggle to cope with the brush of Death's hand.:::1:::3/4
Fans keyed into Eastwood's gentle past work might be more inclined to sit back and allow the filmmaker to find his own way, even if that means a few melodramatic rough patches and a bizarrely pat ending.:::1:::B-
Eventually, you realize the movie isn't comprised of much more than premise, greeting-card wisdom and coincidences, and its two hours start to grow long.:::0:::2/4
Hereafter is really full of half-thoughts. As with Woody Allen's You Will Meet a Tall, Dark Stranger, it's difficult to tell if this film confronts belief or if disbelief simply is being given the upper hand.:::0:::None

Morbid medium hates the dead. Hereafter, Clint must write a new soundtrack or just retire to a Tuscany farmhouse to enjoy old age.:::0:::None
Ambitious to be sure, but this muted exploration of life here and after is one of Eastwood's rare misfires.:::0:::None
Hereafter is quintessential Eastwood, marked by the classic style, level of intimacy and general flair for storytelling that has defined the best of his career.:::1:::4/5
Special mention must be made of Bryce Dallas Howard, who takes a swing at the Manic Pixie Dream Girl role and hits a stand-up double; it's not exactly a good performance, but it briefly energizes a moribund movie.:::0:::2/5
Demeaning both to believers and to unbelievers, and for the same reason: It stacks the deck too heavily in one direction.:::0:::D
Eastwood's latest drama fails to ignite a spark that will bring an audience to see a film involving the afterlife and supernatural.:::0:::2/5
A curiously tantalizing, melancholy meditation on mortality and the afterlife.:::1:::7/10
Well-acted, quietly moving and mildly intriguing, but not nearly as powerful as it could have been with a braver script that took more risks.:::1:::7.3856/10
A soppy, disorganized melodrama with a lot of big ideas and virtually no significance.:::0:::2/5
The filmmaking choices Eastwood has made here range from merely misguided to numbingly dopey.:::0:::5.5/10
For its celebration of the universal yearning for answers to the big questions, Hereafter is an interesting film to look at. It gets more interesting when you factor in a couple of impressive special effects -- yes, in a Clint Eastwood movie.:::1:::3.5/5
It's as if everyone involved in the film figured they could keep Hereafter from turning ghost-story hokey by making it grounded, beautiful and matter-of-fact. And it sort of works.:::1:::6/10
It's meant to make us ask, "All right, what comes after?" But it leaves real Eastwood fans only wondering, "Okay -- what comes next?":::0:::2.5/4
Either you buy their Vaseline-lensed visions of the hereafter, or you watch in stony silence, as I did, wondering why there's no one to care about.:::0:::None
The movie drags, yet it feels like it's missing an hour. It features three characters on three continents who barely interact with one another. And after 130 minutes, it stops without concluding.:::0:::2/4
Hereafter is an overly schematic melodrama that fails to raise a pulse. It's as lifeless as the ghosts that haunt the film's characters.:::0:::70/100
The viewer waits, at first expectantly and later with increasing irritation, as the disparate story strands are forced together in the "are you kidding?" finale.:::0:::2/4
It has the power to haunt the skeptical, to mystify the credulous and to fascinate everyone in between...:::1:::4/4
It's his silliest film since 1990's The Rookie, only without the guilty pleasures of, say, watching Charlie Sheen burn down a bar using nothing more than his natural fire-breathing talents.:::0:::2.5/5
Clint Eastwood's slide into irrelevance continues with this muzzy-headed, vaguely supernatural drama about three people whose lives are shadowed by death.:::0:::None
Hollywood once upon a time made films exploring these kinds of issues, but in today's climate only a filmmaker like Eastwood, determined to never do the same thing twice, would have the nerve and the clout to take it on.:::1:::4.5/5
This is no tale of paranormal activity. It offers no clear-cut answers on life after death. Rather, it calmly examines death, grief and melancholy, packing an unexpectedly profound emotional gut-punch.:::1:::3.5/4
Hereafter makes no grand statement about life after death. It's just Eastwood pondering the subject, as any thoughtful person might, and inviting us to think along with him. It's hard to pass up so sincere an offer.:::1:::3/4
The only thing more disconcerting than seeing an action-disaster sequence open a Clint Eastwood drama is watching the 80-year-old auteur channel M. Night Shyamalan.:::0:::1/5
A poignant, meditative, meaningful, and commendable movie about the afterlife from the uniquely gifted Clint Eastwood.:::1:::5/5
Just because a film takes place entirely in the long shadow of death doesn't mean it has to be this relentlessly dour.:::0:::C
Hereafter is imperfect but it is less about understanding our final destination than how we map out our own course to arrive there:::1:::3.5/5
Hereafter, set to a resonant Eastwood score, truly is haunting.:::1:::3/4
Easily one of the most unusual films in Eastwood's career, and one of the most unique films to come out of Hollywood all year.:::1:::4/5
A trio of thinly-drawn narratives that combine into one triply disappointing mega-"meh", it doesn't so much ask questions about the afterlife as threaten to.:::0:::3/10
Clint Eastwood's somber meditation on life after death is every bit as ponderous as you'd expect. In the hands of this superlative director, it's also very watchable.:::1:::3/4
Another masterful benchmark in Clint Eastwood's illustrious career.:::1:::8/10
Eastwood weaves between these disparate yet intrinsically connected story lines smoothly and without hurry. The pacing may feel a bit too languid, but it allows us to get to know these characters by observing who they are as opposed to what they do.:::1:::None
Damon -- reunited with director Clint Eastwood following their work on Invictus -- makes a sincere, low-key medium, conveying information like a reporter rather than a precious mystic.:::1:::B-
Will eventually be remembered as one of Eastwood's best films of this period of his remarkable career.:::1:::4.5/5
Shifting gears to a softer, gauzier mood, Clint Eastwood's Hereafter finds the masterful icon charting new terrain.:::1:::3/4
d body slack and impassive one moment, radiantly expressive the next, and Stiller plunges pretty fearlessly into barely redeemed unlikability.:::1:::7.5/10
The clashes between Roger and his old friends and bandmates shine a light on the fact that you either have to accept your lost dreams, or fight for them all over again, no matter how much your knees ache or your joints creak.:::1:::B
Greenberg is all about that halting, forward movement. Maybe there's no happy ending for Roger Greenberg, but there's no going back, either, and that counts as progress.:::1:::None
Greenberg's inconclusive last scene hints at the possibility that even the bitterest basket case stands a chance of finding someone who loves him. That's sort of my hope for this movie, too.:::1:::None
perceptive and very beautiful new film:::1:::4/5
Baumbach tracks Roger without glib condescension. That's why Greenberg pulls you in. Even when you laugh, like in the climactic party scene, it hurts.:::1:::3/4
In Greenberg it's sometimes difficult to figure out whether it's Roger or Baumbach who has lost his way.:::0:::2.5/5
Quietly, unobtrusively revealing, and pretty funny too--a shrewdly observed comic portrait of a thoroughgoing egomaniac.:::1:::B
Bittersweet and beautifully realized, harsh but humane, Greenberg is a self-consciously small film that nevertheless leaves an indelible mark.:::1:::A-
As played by Ben Stiller, the character of Greenberg fails to transcend his abhorrent exterior.:::0:::2.5/4
An original and endearing romantic comedy about a difficult person who is trying to get unstuck from his bad habits, cynicism, and fear.:::1:::4/5
...it is Greta Gerwig that is truly the beating heart here.:::1:::7/10
Noah Baumbach's newest serio-comedy is many things, but the word that I keep coming back to is brave.:::1:::None
While Baumbach may not have written Roger Greenberg as his most unlikable character yet, as played by Ben Stiller that's exactly what he becomes.:::0:::2.5/5
Nothing good happens during the course of the movie -- and Baumbach seems to be saying, Take it or leave it. I, for one, take it.:::1:::B+
Baumbach fails to create a compelling case for investing oneself in Greenberg's quest for self-actualization.:::0:::2/4
It's one of my favorite Stiller performances, perhaps precisely because it is such a surprisingly nuanced turn.:::1:::None
Greenberg only slightly misses the top flight by settling for too weak a foil.:::1:::4/5
Greenberg is a perceptive look at coming to terms with, if not entirely embracing, the life you weren't expecting and by no means wanted.:::1:::None
The style is observational, the drama is understated, and, when the time comes, it knocks you out with the subtlest of badda-booms.:::1:::None
You have to hang with it, squeezing pleasure and the occasional chuckle out of its bitter beauty where you can. It's not for everyone but it rewards those who are open to it.:::1:::None
This is tricky, ambiguous material, seemingly better fitted to a short literary novel than to a movie, and it could have gone wrong in a hundred ways, yet Baumbach handles it with great assurance.:::1:::None
American 21st century post traumatic stress and economic desolation gets filtered through the mid-life crisis of Ben Stiller's troubled character Roger Greenberg in Noah Baumbach's edgy romantic comedy that puts a premium on how we treat one another.:::1:::B+
The main reason to see Baumbach's serio comedy of one severely flawed, neurotic New Yorker is not Ben Stiller (who's reliable) but the gorgeous-looking and talented Greta Gerwig as his masochistic love interest, who should become a star.:::1:::C+
Although Ben Stiller's brand of nervy comic ticks can prove irritating on occasions, here he is kept in check so that the humor and the pathos shine through.:::1:::3/5

Inception is the best film of the year and one of the best films of the decade, this is Nolan's masterpiece and it is perfect in every regard.:::1:::10/10
Nolan's eyes here were a little too big for his stomach.:::1:::B-
A smart and inventive thriller, this drama is one of the year's best movies.:::1:::5.0/5
Nolan has cemented himself among the great filmmakers of our time, not only with this film, but with most of his other works as well.:::1:::4/4
Despite its two- and a half-hour length, it flies by and just like a great dream you don't want to wake up from, even after the end credits start, you'll desperately crave five more minutes.:::1:::10/10
Ambitious, sure, but ultimately too far-fetched for its own good.:::0:::60/100
The technical virtuosity pouring from every frame is astounding.:::1:::A
It's intentionally, thrillingly, disorienting.:::1:::4/5
Flaws aside, there's a lot to like about Inception and Nolan keeps his eye on the ball throughout, offering up a lush treat of a thriller with nerve and wit:::1:::8/10
Taken at theatrical value, director/writer Christopher Nolan's tale of purposeful memory-travel is a fun and exciting trip into the creative subconscious.:::1:::3.5/5
A film trying feverishly to spin your head whilst feverishly trying to explain how it's spinning it.:::0:::None
It is the film by which to measure the density of all others.:::1:::3.5/4
What is the point of having an imagination, I ask you, if the only thing that can be imagined is mayhem, perpetrated without regard for even the appearance of human life?:::0:::None
A brain-twister to be sure. But the fact that the plot demands attention only adds to the exhilaration. This is a story about dreams that requires the audience to stay awake.:::1:::None
It's a bold, stunning feature of impossible technical virtuosity. It also has the tendency to be about as emotionally stimulating as a college lecture.:::1:::B
This is architecture as cinema, on every level: Narrative, conceptual, symbolic, visual...:::1:::None
Christopher Nolan has created a Lynchian fantasy set in the mind that is devastating in its originality and innovation...:::1:::None
...there's no denying those special effects. They are spectacular and creative in the extreme.:::1:::7/10
The reality isn't quite as enthralling as one would hope.:::0:::None
The action set pieces are deliriously spectacular; one involving a gravity-impaired Gordon-Levitt in an ever-rotating hallway is wondrous to behold.:::1:::4.5/5
A trippy, complex, thrill-driven action-adventure that demands (and rewards) repeat viewings.:::1:::9/10
Un thriller inteligente aunque algo menos complejo de lo que aparenta, que cae en varios excesos narrativos y visuales. Probablemente la pelicula mas ambiciosa de Nolan hasta la fecha.:::1:::3/5
See it more than once, you'll see something different every time.:::1:::None
I'm somewhat disappointed that Nolan didn't make a different movie, I heartily enjoyed the one he did make.:::1:::3.5/5
Nuevamente Nolan nos sorprende con un ejercicio inteligente y vibrante, con un DiCaprio maduro y un cast perfecto. La cinta del ano para Hollywood.:::1:::5/5
Nolan gledateljima prua zabavu za osjetila i intelekt na na&#269;in koji se &#269;ini iznad mogu&#263;nosti najve&#263;eg broja njegovih kolega:::1:::8/10
full review at Movies for the Masses:::1:::5/5
Conceptually alluring but laborious and visionless:::0:::None
A classic-in-waiting that will keep you guessing and thinking while you pick your jaw up off the floor.:::1:::5/5
Nolan's script keeps the parallel narrative threads concise, and through gorgeous cinematography by Wally Pfister and sharp editing by Lee Smith.:::1:::4/4
Is the movie over-thought? Sometimes, yes. But challenging material is rarely as satisfying as in this blockbuster from one of the dream factory's most gifted artisans.:::1:::3.5/4
A marvelous, highly enjoyable film that continues Nolan's climb toward the very top of the list of the best filmmakers working today.:::1:::4.5/5
Intelligent and imaginative Inception is eye bending and mind bending in equal measures.:::1:::5/5
It's too easy to see not only that Mal is trouble, but also that Dom will walk right into that trouble she is.:::0:::None
Uma ficcao cientifica que faz jus aos melhores do genero, apresentando-nos a conceitos intrigantes e dedicando-se, entao, a explora-los ate suas consequencias mais extremas.:::1:::5/5
Inception, which has been talked up to crazy heights and showcases the best, as well as the most problematic, aspects of Nolan's directorial chops.:::1:::65/100
If you think "Lost" was complicated, let's just say it's kitten chow when compared to this.:::1:::B+
Inception made my brain hurt. And it hurt in the most wonderful way.:::1:::4.5/5
Must-see? Absolutely. But let's not get carried away. Primer was every bit as challenging but populated with characters who seemed real and spoke like human beings.:::1:::B
Especially recommended for diehard film lovers, this cinematic archaeological dig will interest anyone fascinated by one of filmdom's great might-have-beens.:::1:::None
Brain, meet spasm. Inception is the cleverest, most original use of a Blockbuster budget we've seen in years. Shame some of the characters are a bit underdeveloped.:::1:::4/5
Christopher Nolan proves himself as both a man of action and ideas, as he delves into the male psyche and enriches the soul in Inception.:::1:::4.5/5
"Hooray!":::1:::4.95/5
Visually stunning Inception trips on its own cleverness, sacrificing character development in the pursuit of ingenuity. One can forgive its hubris and give it credit for being a thinking man's action movie.:::1:::3.5/5
Nolan has spun an elegantly cerebral story that is primal, compelling, and as visually disconcerting as it is completely captivating:::1:::5/5
This is a long film with a lot of fiery explosions, intelligent ideas, sputtering machine guns, and violent car crashes.:::1:::8/10
The best, most believable entry to date in an inherently imaginative genre. Excellent cast.:::1:::A
An at-times dizzying Mobius strip of a sci-fi thriller, it's both a tremendously challenging and tremendously rewarding movie, the type that will have audiences talking -- and debating -- long after the credits roll.:::1:::3.5/4
A giant win for audiences and the degree to which filmmakers can respect their intelligence.:::1:::5/5
Inception may be the most intelligent action film you will ever see.:::1:::A+
The film has a dark, sad emotional puzzle at its core, and the suspense of this held me as much as the planning of the ultimate caper. DiCaprio and Cotillard between them resonate grief.:::1:::None
Nolan repousse les limites de son cinema pour nous offrir - une fois de plus - son oeuvre la plus dense et stimulante a ce jour.:::1:::9/10
This metaphysical 'Mission: Imposible' is motivated by a challenge as great as that facing its heroes: It's Nolan's attempt to crack the Great Film vault. Mission accomplished? Yes -- and more crucially -- no.:::1:::3/4
Inception a dynamic, moving mind-bender.:::1:::4.0/4.0
For all of its capacity to bewilder and befuddle, Inception still must be endorsed purely on the strength of its ambition, and the awesome heights to which it sometimes soars.:::1:::4/5
Nolan is having the time of his life in his own personal playground and, for all its heavy technical and narrative machinery, Inception remains one of his lightest films.:::1:::3.5/5
It is irritating for an hour, being so gloomily lit that you need fog lights, then it opens up into a marvellously inventive, somewhat silly but enjoyable heist movie, with a good cast doing things I doubt even they could explain.:::1:::4/5
It's just streets ahead of anything I've seen in a long time.:::1:::4.5/5
One of those films, like Blade Runner or 2001 A Space Odyssey, that will repay many viewings in order to grasp all the intricate details of these multi-layered trips into the dreams and nightmares of the central characters.:::1:::4.5/5
[Nolan] has planted the idea that his film is the most brilliant, original and smart film in years. And everyone thinks they realized this on their own.:::1:::4/5
And [Nolan] said, "let there be originality", and there was originality. He called it Inception and audiences and critics alike saw that it was good.:::1:::4.5/5
Even its flaws are brilliant -- and without its flaws and a few evidences of self-mocking humor, I'm not sure I'd like it nearly as well as I do.:::1:::5/5
Nolan clearly has great fun with the action stuff - zero gravity fights in a hotel corridor, an assault on an artic fortress and a car chase through a dreamed city are all cracking - and it all looks as spectacular as you'd hope.:::1:::None
I thought this film was going to be a real brain-twister like "Memento" or "The Prestige," but "Inception" is not all that complicated, which is helpful, given all those special game-type rules you have to keep track of.:::1:::B
Inception is a diverting gambit, but you might want to check your watch a few times to see when the dreams are going to be over.:::1:::2.5/5
The film's promise is watered down in the execution by a sense of it being a novelty, a plaything for Nolan to bamboozle his audience with his clever mind trick:::1:::None
A scintillating exploration of dreams, reality and the fine line that divides them, Inception toys with our minds on a massive scale, sending us on a dizzying trip which makes all our preconceptions spin relentlessly:::1:::None
Indeed, Hollywood's obsession with 3D has extended to the storytelling process, and with Inception, it also reminds us that story and characterization still rule in the land of a thousand digital vistas.:::1:::4.5/5
Nolan borrows from classic heist and caper movies to design the clockwork tension but this particular clock is more like Dali's dripping watch.:::1:::4/5
Cinematically, this is a keeper, a fireworks grand finale that goes on flashing and booming for two hours and twenty-eight minutes. But, oh, for some genuine heart.:::1:::4/5
Once in the dreamspace, Nolan's command of multi-layered storytelling is nothing short of astounding.:::1:::8.9/10
the balance of philosophical ideas and narrative tension are more than enough to keep the film not just engaging, but utterly riveting for its entire duration:::1:::4/4
Inception is the exception to a boring summer!:::1:::5/5
A well-constructed, narratively audacious blockbuster released at a time when such things are in depressingly short supply.:::1:::4/5
An astonishment, an engineering feat, and, finally, a folly.:::0:::None
A patently-preposterous, endlessly-elliptical mindbender that's worth the investment just to be able to say you sat through it, even if you can't follow all of its meandering machinations. It's that hip!:::1:::2/4
Despite the fact that some details of the labyrinthine plot are simply too obscure to comprehend on a first viewing, Nolan sells the emotion -- and the consequences -- visually.:::1:::3.5/4
Cinema is rarely this engaging on so many levels.:::1:::5/5
This is the kind of film studios need to green light more often... all orchestrated by the crafting hand of a director who knows what he wants and makes it happen.:::1:::3.5/4.0
Preposterous, but so ingeniously done that it's an entertaining ride.:::1:::7/10
Just like a spinning top, you keep hoping Christopher Nolan's movie will last a little bit longer.:::1:::10/10
It's heartening to see that the quirky sensibility Nolan brought to 'Memento' has never left him.:::1:::4.5/5
It's bold. It's exciting. It makes you think. It engages. It impresses. It frustrates. And it does it all a helluva lot better than Shutter Island.:::1:::3.5/4
The first masterpiece of 2010. A perfect blend of performance, story, music and effects.:::1:::4/4
A dream within a dream.:::1:::4/4
The complexity of the plot works to make the film a must see, but it also ends up frustrating the audience because it all can't be figured out on the first viewing:::1:::8/10
...one of the strongest science-fiction concepts to come along in some time...:::1:::A-
I suspect even repeat viewings won't be enough to nail this one down: Like 2001, it's both knotty enough and ambiguous enough to lead to conflicting opinions. Besides, our dreams are open to different interpretations, so why not some of our films as well?:::1:::4/4
The ending will leave you debating in that glass half-full, half-empty kind of way. Let's just say, it's a movie that needs to be seen more than once.:::1:::3.5/4
Only someone who never saw (or appreciated) Dark City would be able to call it visionary.:::0:::2/5
This is not only the best movie ever made about dreams, it is also one of the best films of 2010, and certainly one of the most entertaining pictures I've seen in a decade.:::1:::4/4
It is a fascinating visual feast, The Matrix with heart and soul, a rollercoaster ride into layers of the subconscious mind that challenges our ability to keep up.:::1:::3.5/4
What it is (an action-heavy heist movie with several mind-blowing setpieces) is an entirely pleasant substitute for what it isn't (a psychologically complex investigation into dream logic).:::1:::8/10
Nolan has basically done the impossible. He's taken $200 million and, instead of coming up with a highly generic product, he's made a real movie.:::1:::None
There are plenty of reasons to like Inception, whether you found it obvious or impenetrable. You'll wish you could dream as lucidly as this, but be grateful here you have Nolan as your tour guide.:::1:::4.5/5
In its perfection Inception is unsurprising - it's about what I expected, and that's good enough.:::1:::None
If you recall the scene in Dahmer (2002) where Jeremy Renner as the deranged killer drills holes into his victims' heads, you'll know what watching this Freudian claptrap of a thriller is like.:::0:::None
It makes 'The Matrix' look like a Dick & Jane book.:::1:::4.5/5
It requires more concentration to just figure out what's going on than most summer blockbusters do.:::1:::B
This is a drama built around ideas and images; it is a cinematic maze that Nolan makes his audience traverse in order to follow, understand and appreciate his world.:::1:::3.5/4
It's hard to connect with a movie when it tries so hard to fool you; is this a dream, is it not, is it a dream within a dream? Who cares? Just commit to something and get on with it. A crushing bore.:::0:::D
Inception is a nightmare for audiences looking for coherent fiction.:::0:::2.5/4
A groundbreaking, intriguing, exhilarating and brilliant sci-fi thriller that's destined to become a timeless classic. Mark my words: It will be remembered for years to come.:::1:::9.88/10
Who are we to complain when a filmmaker lets his thoughts get the better of him, especially when most summer blockbusters aren't thinking at all.:::1:::84/100
The movie is almost hypnotic -- a mind-bending experience laced with palpable tension and fueled with drama. Sweet dreams.:::1:::3.5/4
Inception is elegantly realised. DiCaprio powerfully embodies a tortured soul while Gordon-Levitt has all the fun in the best action sequence.:::1:::None
After a couple of days' reflection, while I still would happily recommend the film as one of the best blockbusters I've seen this year, the flaws of the movie became increasingly apparent.:::1:::None
Inception is an intense, complex story, but it's always coherent, imaginative, and entertaining.:::1:::4/5
More time wasting than time bending, Inception is a shoot 'em up masquerading as a thinking person's sci-fi film.:::0:::2.5/4
This sophisticated and uniquely clever cinematic concoction is a refreshing change from the usual lineup of mindless summer fare. The acting and dialogue take a back seat to the mind-blowing action that is...:::1:::3/4
DiCaprio and co. manipulate thematic fetishes like a dream of Mission Impossible envisioned by Phillip K. Dick:::1:::B+
"Inception" is a sci-fi psychological thriller that doesn't always know when to coast or how to take emotional advantage of its over-the-top visual effects.:::1:::B+
Nolan is a very clever fellow, no argument there. He's skilled at juggling big ideas and making us think. Now if he can just make us feel.:::1:::2.5/4
The final half-hour alone is a miracle of clockwork-precise showmanship.:::1:::4.5/5
It's only the latest indication that Christopher Nolan might be the slyest narrative tactician making movies today.:::1:::4/4
This seems to be the year of taking visuals in movies up a notch. Cameron did it with 'Avatar,' Nolan does it with 'Inception.':::1:::B+
Pretty good, not bad, but brilliant it surely ain't.:::1:::3/4
Inception is a boldly constructed wonder with plenty of -- as one character describes it -- "paradoxical architecture.":::1:::4/4
I found myself admiring the movie's stubborn adherence to its own universe and logic.:::1:::4.5/5
Nolan, like Cobb, is an assiduous extractor, and he knows how to wow audiences. But scaling big and thinking big are not the same thing. And dark, just because it's dark, isn't more artistic than light.:::1:::B
Nolan's tale is not only a trip through mental labyrinths but a reminder that memories may cripple us, unless we learn to let them go.:::1:::3.5/4
Nolan hypnotizes us with his elegant dreamscapes, but uses them to draw attention back to the figures at the heart of it all.:::1:::A
Inception, the latest in Nolan's long list of awe-inspiring films, proves to be his most ambitious and satisfying project to date.:::1:::5/5
The good news is, I'm not going to give away any of the mind-bending twists at the center of Inception. The bad news is, that's because there aren't any.:::1:::6/10
Like his protagonist, Nolan excels as an implanter of subversive ideas. This time, alas, he didn't dig quite deep enough for them to take root.:::1:::None
Inception is so slow and so confusing that you may actually fall asleep. Or wish you were really dreaming and could wake up and dream another movie.:::0:::2/5
Mixes arcane talk about dreams with traditional action sequences resulting in strange and ineffective hybrid.:::0:::2/5
DiCaprio is his usual terrific self. He is the Paul Newman of this generation.:::1:::None
Visually spectacular, without resorting to 3-D.:::1:::None
Are they handing out joints at the box office for this?:::0:::1/5
There are so many dreams within dreams, I thought I might've been dreaming. 'Inception' isn't a bad movie, but I could never sit through it again. It's up to the viewer to decide whether or not they will ride it out with Prince Valium.:::1:::B-
A what's on your mind invasive sci-fi noir specializing in homo sapien interior decorating, that operates at a level way beyond viewer comprehension. Though this messing with your head nap time thriller boasts intermittent mind bending imagery.:::0:::None
This is a movie people will go see and then argue about and then, very likely, go see again. It is instantly the must-see film of the summer.:::1:::5/5
By turns overpowering, spectacular and truly awe-inspiring. Nolan has just taken it to the next level.:::1:::4/5
Inception is that rare film that can be enjoyed on superficial and progressively deeper levels, a feat that uncannily mimics the mind-bending journey its protagonist takes.:::1:::3.5/4
By convoluting the various planes of experience, by overlapping and obscuring ostensible realities and ostensible dreams, Mr. Nolan deprives us the opportunity of investing emotionally in any of it.:::0:::None
You know how much of a cheat it is when a movie concludes with a character waking up and realizing it was all a dream? Inception goes another way: Its characters wake up from their dreams to figure out what's real.:::1:::4/4
The most audacious and multifaceted Hollywood entertainment for grown-ups I've seen in years.:::1:::4/4
It wins points for trying to convey difficult, ambitious themes, and even more points for actually succeeding.:::1:::A-
Wrapped up in the logistics of various dreamscapes and the technical details of dream sharing and inception, the picture all but abandons its most essential thread.:::0:::2.5/4
Inception becomes its own nightmare by trying to be "too" smart.:::0:::2/5
The visual effects are outstanding, including a fight scene that rivals any ever put on film.:::1:::3.5/4
Christopher Nolan's films are things of beauty, precisely constructed and expertly executed. But you wouldn't want to live there.:::1:::B-
Inception is the most astonishing thing you will see all year. It may be one of the most astonishing things you will ever see.:::1:::9/10
The first of [Nolan's] films that I would call flat-out fun.:::1:::9/10
Does the long-anticipated Christopher Nolan film Inception deliver what we've been hoping for? In a word: Yes.:::1:::5/5
t has all of Nolan's strengths, and some of his weaknesses, and it is undeniably his. It is a $160 million action film about loss and regret, and it is exciting in part because of its flaws.:::1:::4.5/5
Inception is often thrilling to watch, but there's something hollow at its center.:::1:::3/4
(S)tories should show, not tell, and Nolan keeps telling us that he can't tell this story.:::0:::2/10
The first of many major achievements in this memorable and haunting film is to render other people's dreams - not the most interesting of topics normally - absolutely riveting.:::1:::4/5
In a decade dominated by the three dreaded Rs of remakes, reimaginings and reboots comes a truly original blockbuster.:::1:::5/5
The most intelligent and visually stunning film of the year. Literally mind-bending.:::1:::5/5
All it asks of viewers is that they do something rare: engage the intellect.:::1:::3.5/4
In it we see the promise of a brilliant career realized undeniably. It's a great achievement, and, yes, a great film.:::1:::A
A grandiose exploration of the subconscious and a blazing piece of puzzlemaking.:::1:::4.5/5
Nolan's greatest aspect might be his own ability to show restraint when he could easily over blow everything. It worked miracles in Dark Knight and it has crafted a masterpiece in the form of Inception.:::1:::None
It's the kind of thing that only comes along once every few decades.:::1:::4/4
An intellectualized action flick or an action-packed intellectual film? The answer, of course, is that it's both.:::1:::4/4
Like any traditional narrative, it starts at point A and ends at point B. It just goes backward through the alphabet to get there.:::1:::3/4
A rather juvenile brain-teaser lacking an effective emotional core but bursting with cool visuals. Unlike the most powerful dreams it doesn't stick with you.:::0:::C+
Nolan dares the viewer to jump into his multi-layered world, his own maze, and dedicated moviegoers will not be able to resist - even for a second, third, or fourth time.:::1:::A-
Worth every penny spent in the making, and worth every dollar forked over for a ticket, Inception may just be the best movie of 2010.:::1:::A
A smartly scripted, big-budget action/heist movie of the sort you'd expect from the director of The Dark Knight.:::1:::A
A heist picture at heart, the dream-world-set thriller harkens back to the reality-shifting days of "The Matrix," but edges toward intelligence in all of the places the Wachowski brothers opted for visceral popcorn thrills.:::1:::3/4
Rule of thumb: if a movie uses the word "deep" as much as this one does, it probably isn't.:::0:::2/4
I absolutely loved every minute of it.:::1:::3.5/4
The ambition on display is so huge, and the filmmaking so intelligent, you'll emerge feeling as if you've just watched an entire season of the greatest sci-fi series never made.:::1:::5/5
You have to love a movie that dares people to think big.:::1:::4.5/5
This is a popular entertainment with a knockout punch so intense and unnerving it'll have you worrying if it's safe to close your eyes at night.:::1:::4/5
Nolan's film is surely the most ambitious psychological thriller ever, and yet also the most personal. His baroque imagination makes most directors' efforts look like beach-pail sand castles alongside Mad King Ludwig's Neuschwanstein Castle.:::1:::4/4
A superior summer movie, one with heart and brains and loads of razzle-dazzle.:::1:::None
Meanwhile, explanations are offered, buildings collapse on themselves, DiCaprio frets moodily, henchmen fall over and that white van keeps falling off that bridge ... It's all very beautiful, and mostly very empty.:::0:::2/4
With its James Bond-on-acid action scenes and puzzle-within-a-maze-within-a-puzzle mind games, Inception is certainly the most daring and original blockbuster of the year, as well as a visual tour de force. If it only had a heart.:::1:::A-
unlike anything you've seen:::1:::5/5
As the dreams build upon each other and Cobb's past creeps through, Nolan has us just where he wants us -- deliriously lost in a world where dreams and reality are indecipherable, and curious enough to stand in line for another showing.:::1:::3.5/4
This is what movies can be like if you try.:::1:::4/4
Inception is the blockbuster we've all been thirsting for, a sleek brain-twister that makes the other 2010 mainstream releases look puny, drab and empty-headed in comparison.:::1:::A
Inception delivers dazzling special effects and a boatload of stars, but it sags and eventually buckles under the weight of its complicated premise.:::0:::None
Nolan is a thinker, all right, a very busy explorer of mind functions, but capable merely of diagrams when it comes to the heart and soul.:::1:::None
Inception is an extraordinarily ambitious work. It's a bit overlong at 148 minutes, but I couldn't tell you what I would have cut out of it.:::1:::None
Arguably the best film of the summer and most likely all year, the latest film from writer/director Christopher Nolan is a heady trip that comes off as a thinking person's action flick. (Parental Review also Available):::1:::None
Beautiful and bloodless. Like a dream, it doesn't implant ideas you'll carry with you outside of the multiplex:::1:::B-
With its cityscapes hinged like drawbridges, "Inception" resembles something Dutch illusionist M.C. Escher might have conceived. At other moments, the film invokes the great Stanley Kubrick, another artist specializing in chilly mind-mazes.:::1:::B+
Mr. DiCaprio exercises impressive control in portraying a man on the verge of losing his grip, but Mr. Nolan has not, in the end, given Cobb a rich enough inner life to sustain the performance.:::1:::3/5
Inception is the rare blockbuster entry as sophisticated and intelligent as it is exciting and spectacular.:::1:::3.5/4
If the career of Christopher Nolan is any indication, we've entered an era in which movies can no longer be great. They can only be awesome, which isn't nearly the same thing.:::0:::None
..it all becomes a bit too much, a little exhausting, even a little boring...gets by on its Escher-esque visuals which Nolan tries to give more import to by cranking Hans Zimmer's doom laden, fog horn score.:::1:::B
One way to salvage some fun with this blunderbuss would be to fall asleep while watching and dream up a better movie yourself. Try it. You'll avoid a headache.:::0:::None
The fact that it manages to be both unmissable and maddening doesn't kill the immediate buzz, since half the film's thrills consist of simply keeping up with it.:::1:::4/5
In this smart sci-fi puzzle box, director Christopher Nolan transports the audience to a dreamscape that begins with the familiar and then takes a radical, imaginative leap.:::1:::3.5/4
Like a dream, Nolan's film fades swiftly in the light -- but while it lasts, it feels like there's nothing more important to decipher.:::1:::4/5
Leonardo DiCaprio's new thriller is as good as live action cinema gets...and you're about to have some very deep dreams to prove it.:::1:::5/5
This truly remarkable movie represents imagination of the highest order conducted by a true master of the art of motion pictures.:::1:::5/5
Without a substantial story to support the whole, the piece is as weightless as the 'Zzzzzz team' itself, floating through the multiple levels of dreams within dreams.:::0:::5/10
Even minor roles are filled by sterling talent (including Michael Caine as Cobb's mentor), which is testament to the originality and precision of Christopher Nolan. His is a mind that's definitely worth getting lost in.:::1:::4/5
Inception may be the brainiest hokum ever released in a cinematic summer. Imagine Last Year in Marienbad wandering into the orbit of producer Jerry Bruckheimer.:::1:::3/5
Inception is one of the most original, thought-provoking, intense, mind-blowing pieces of entertainment I have ever seen. I would pay money to watch people's reactions.:::1:::5/5
Emotional intimacy is lacking, with some characters functioning merely as devices to explain an increasingly complicated scenario, but there's no doubt that Nolan knows how to craft an enthralling brainteaser.:::1:::4/5
After thinking it'd take "a couple months" to ink, director Christopher Nolan took eight years to painstakingly write the "Inception" script. And you can tell. It's his first pure masterpiece.:::1:::5/5
Nolan's concept is as irresistible as its execution.:::1:::None
Kaboom plays out like a a ridiculously campy, and poorly written comic book. It's not very coherent and has a terrible ending.:::0:::4/10
Araki has crafted an entertaining, violently funny movie that's amongst his best work yet.:::1:::None
After walking out of KABOOM, I wanted to take a nice, hot shower to wash myself of this filthy film, but holy hell I had a blast.:::1:::None
there's no method to Kaboom's utter-insanity; it crumbles badly in the final minutes and reveals its central mystery as little more than a meaningless whimsy.:::0:::3/5
Araki movies used to feel dangerous. This one feels like underfunded kitsch.:::0:::None
Enjoy the audacious, electrifying and subversive components thrown at the audience in scattergun style.:::1:::4/5
Isn't anarchic and invigorated but sloppy and limp.:::0:::C-
While the cast is good-looking, making them wear quirky hats doesn't always work. But, despite all the oddness, it is strangely compelling with some sharp and witty lines.:::1:::3/5
The tone and production values suggest a mixture of daytime soap, gay porn and Twilight slash-fiction, but the film's greatest asset, as ever with Araki, is sincerity.:::1:::None
It's the kind of film that refuses to draw lines between what's real and what's hallucination, just as the characters resist defining their identity by sexual orientation.:::1:::3/5
This is a wild movie in a Lynch-lite mode.:::1:::None
A very peculiar campus comedy in which the students seem to have abandoned any pretence of intellectual endeavour for a non-stop merry-go-round of bed-hopping.:::0:::2/5
The soundtrack's the perfect mixtape, the visuals the perfect day-glo trashpop video - just don't expect too much in the way of boring old depth and meaning.:::1:::3/5
A delirious, demented cross between Donnie Darko and Twin Peaks with an undeniably handsome cast and a good deal of film-making skill. Don't expect it to make a lot of sense but just enjoy the wild trip.:::1:::3/5
Think Eyes Wide Shut with its legs wide open.:::0:::2/5
Two very different films have been mashed up in Kaboom...:::1:::3/5
Watching films whose characters spend much of their time staring at computer screens or waking up from dreams is a bit of a drag.:::0:::2/5
Kaboom also resembles nothing so much as an episode of Scooby Doo without the dog, and with an awful lot of penetrative sex.:::1:::3/5
Squarely aimed at a student demographic, the entire affair plays out like an episode of Scooby Doo on acid with the added fuel of frequent sex.:::1:::3/5
Araki's trademark comic book-vibrant visuals and a cool, indie soundtrack intensify the overall trippy experience, keeping everything cohesive even when the narrative goes entirely off the rails in the rushed final act.:::1:::4/5
Bright and intoxicating, but too cluttered to be placed alongside the director's best.:::1:::3/5
Its permanent entry into the cult canon may be scuppered by its cheap cinematography, and a general lack of charm.:::0:::2/5
[Araki] made The Living End, Mysterious Skin and other anthems to gay America. Kaboom is less an anthem, more a discordant impromptu.:::0:::2/5
Enjoyable, stylishly directed teen sci-fi comedy with a gleefully bonkers script, a strong cast and a star-making supporting turn from Juno Temple, though it's all a bit too chaotic to really engage on an emotional level.:::1:::3/5
If there's an undercurrent of impending cataclysm in today's culture, 'Kaboom' senses that feeling, seizes it in a surreal clinch and hurtles with it off a cliff.:::1:::4/5
Designed to have its own fun, filled to the brim with bangs of all kinds but mostly landing with a whimper.:::0:::None
Gregg Araki's sci-fi is a weird and, just occasionally, wonderful skew on the college comedy. Slight but fun.:::1:::3/5
I've often thought that I'd like to see a bit more of Juno Temple. After seeing Kaboom, I don't think it'd be possible to see more of Juno Temple.:::1:::3/5
It's good to see the respectability Araki won from 2004's Mysterious Skin hasn't sapped his subversive streak.:::1:::4/5
... a freewheeling mystery-satire about friendship, flip-flops, campus conspiracies, paranormal activities and The Big Bang Theory.:::1:::2.5/4
What pop spectacle!:::1:::3/4
The film is Araki's most ambitious to date, with a quick pace, music that's hip and cool and a mood that alternates between playful and eccentric.:::1:::2.5/4
All that's truly strange here though is that Araki gets so few jolts or laughs from this hodge-podge of genres.:::0:::None
It's an apocalyptic fable for the cool kids, and while most of the comedic elements work, the faux supernatural stuff is just dopey. That's probably the point. Never mind.:::1:::3/5
Any aging hipster harbouring feelings of nostalgia for the scrappy movies Gregg Araki made before the relative maturity of his 2004 molestation drama Mysterious Skin will be thrilled by the American director's latest salacious story of youth gone wild.:::1:::3/5
A crazy 'college kids' sex fantasy with horror and sci fi elements possibly written and directed while on illicit substances:::1:::None
...Araki is in fine form here; nearly every scene in the film is either hyper-real or frankly artificial and there are lots of references to the conventions of genre films, horror films in particular.:::1:::6/10
Araki deserves credit for maintaining his independent spirit. But "Kaboom" is short on impact.:::0:::2/4
With Kaboom, Araki takes a huge step backward from the maturity and restraint he demonstrated in 2004's Mysterious Skin, his best and most-assured film to date (and, tellingly, his only adaptation of someone else's material).:::0:::None
The fact that the characters spout snappy, profane dialogue while all this is, or isn't, going on around them is more "fun" than fun; Araki's like the too-drunk guy who won't go home when the party's over.:::0:::D+
What's going on? Who cares?:::0:::D
It's certainly all Araki up there, and the film is handsome and swiftly paced. But it also feels terribly routine and even, strangely, for all the trangressiveness it strives for, retrograde.:::0:::C
Araki has been making movies for more than 20 years now, and his ideas haven't evolved all that much.:::0:::2.5/4
Its deranged pastiche of soap opera, science fiction, apocalyptic thriller and teen film with Araki's punk sensibility, wicked humour, New Queer Cinema politics and cinematic craftsmanship is pure fun.:::1:::4/5
"Kaboom'' is currently having all the sex other American comedies are too shy and too commercial for.:::1:::3/4
Less a boom than a whimper.:::0:::2/4
A vaguely Lynchian thriller with snarky comedic twists that works well -- right up until Araki lets all the air out with a lazily expository final sequence.:::0:::5.6/10
Copulation practically overcomes the alleged premise.:::0:::None
Sort of likable, despite Araki's utter lack of interest in charming anyone who isn't already a member of his small following.:::0:::2/4
Gregg Araki likes to call his new film Kaboom, "a bisexual 'Twin Peaks' in college." But it's more like a hipster take on Scooby Doo with a lot of indiscriminate sex thrown in.:::0:::5/10
This isn't satire, it isn't that funny and the only bits that work are the titillating ones.:::0:::1.5/4
Takes a half-hearted stab at horror/thriller, but the only thing it's really about is young people having sex.:::1:::None
Much of the film seems to make no sense, and when all is finally resolved, it feels arbitrary and pointless.:::0:::2/4
A horny, hallucinogenic fantasy whose descent into nightmare doesn't stop it from becoming enjoyably silly in its final, here's-the-bonkers-thing-that's-happening explanation.:::1:::3.5/5
The movie has been cast, designed, clothed, scored and edited to the bleeding edge of hip, but it hasn't exactly been written.:::0:::2.5/4
...like Araki's own "Rocky Horror Picture Show" with its fetishized aliens, hetero, homo and three-way sexual couplings and its hero's obsession with an iconically named blond surfer dude.:::1:::B
Sexy, dark, occasionally funny, good performances--but it's just too stupid to recommend.:::0:::2.5/5
Gregg Araki has made a career out of sex and sexuality parables; his work is sexy, and at first glance perhaps low-brow exploitation, but like few filmmakers, his work eagerly ponders the sliding scale of human sexuality.:::1:::3/5
Is it wrong to wish that Araki had taken the care to bring his audience to at least one of the multiple climaxes enjoyed by his characters?:::0:::5/10
The film is so disjointed and chaotic that the usual pleasures of Araki's films-which arise from the freedom that his lost boys enjoy-never take hold.:::0:::None
There is only one director who can adeptly blend sinister religious cults, apocalyptic conspiracies and kinky sexual escapades of all varieties...and his name isn't Ron Howard.:::1:::B
Araki lets his absurdist imagination run wild, and "Kaboom" takes the time-honored gambit of gradually revealing that nothing is as it seems to delightfully cockamamie extremes.:::1:::3.5/5
...zips along entertainingly, even when the ending runs off the rails.:::1:::None
A comedy shot in bright colors, sending up horror movies, sci-fi and Araki's constant theme of voracious sexuality. At times too cerebral, but his most playful film yet.:::1:::None
Gregg Araki's Kaboom may be the most cheerful movie ever made about the impending apocalypse.:::1:::8/10
The planet's annihilation has never been so ineffectual.:::0:::1.5/4
Kaboom might be borderline camp, but there's no spillover. Or perhaps it's the other way around. Perhaps Araki's vision of human sexuality is so fluid that the borders are always expanding.:::1:::None
The movie's hot, bathed in an erotic glow, but horribly empty.:::0:::1.5/4
New Queer Cinema progenitor Gregg Araki backslides into remedial artsy filmmaking with a poorly conceived story about the end of the world.:::0:::C-
Kaboom is an erotic blast of sinful flesh, fun and fantasy that you don't want to stop.:::1:::3/4
"Kaboom" is a return to Araki's frivolous past -- fun to watch but mostly forgettable.:::0:::2/4
[A] chaotic, trifling, oddly likable film.:::1:::3/5
A delirious and lighthearted pop spectacle with a dark undercurrent of apocalyptic horror, "Kaboom" is about 95 percent of the movie that writer-director Gregg Araki's fans have been waiting for.:::1:::None
It's in the sack where the film cuts loose, where the characters loose their aloof attitudes and the only honest moments in the otherwise glib gabfest occur.:::0:::2/4
An aching melodrama that turns the lingering pains of youth into paranormal puzzles that the hero keeps trying to solve.:::1:::B+
A film that speeds through a dizzying array of silly plotlines in its 86 rambunctious minutes.:::1:::3.5/4
Writer-director Gregg Araki makes an unwelcome return to the facile sexual-outlaw posing of his '90s movies.:::0:::C
It's a cream puff... full of maggots. I loved it!:::1:::None
Araki discovers modern morality within the blueeyed ruins of a Hollister model the same way archeologists uncover ancient totems.:::1:::None
I found myself digging the vitality, the aliveness, the mischief and wit of Araki's script and ideas...casually shocking and consistently, surprisingly witty.:::1:::None
It's as if Araki simply decided to make the horniest episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer ever.:::1:::3/5
[Araki's] assembled the best-looking cast in town and it's largely his gaga appreciation that makes the movie so much fun.:::1:::None
At least it's out there, but I don't ultimately enjoy the ride.:::0:::None
Repetition or refinement: Kaboom is yet another Araki youth movie that chronicles alienation, eroticism, and sexual identity.:::0:::C+
Araki is back to his young-boy tricks, ready to rock the world:::1:::3.5/5
Araki, who must be applauded at least for brazenly championing bisexuality, really should have saved the title of his 1994 effort for this one: Totally F***ed Up.:::0:::5/10
You have to admire [Araki's] sense of style and ambition even if the convoluted narrative begins to grate.:::1:::3/5
Unfortunately, as is so often the case, it all went downhill in the last half hour.:::0:::None
It's both silly and creepy, with honest subtext about youthful searching and the complexities of human sexuality.:::1:::4/5
Finds Gregg Araki seeking a balance betweThe tagline says Hyenas is 'The urban legend no one wanted to talk about till now!' Hm. I don't think anyone wants to talk about it, even now.:::0:::None

It could be argued that you can't have your cape and eat it, but for the most part Kick-Ass is witty, knowing and hugely fun.:::1:::3.5 / 5
With its electrifying action sequences, a killer storyline and a maverick comic sensibility, the brilliance of Kick Ass will hit those who want to see it like a thunderbolt.:::1:::4.5/5
If you're not too put-off by lots of violence and profanity, and enjoy a good action-filled popcorn flick, then chances are you're going to love "Kick-Ass.":::1:::3/4
If you want to get serious, you could say that Kick-Ass is the movie that could finally drag comic-books into the credible mainstream. But being serious is to miss the point of Kick-Ass completely.:::1:::5/5
Where do I stand on Kick-Ass? On the fence, goggling with a mix of appalled fascination and guilty pleasure at the film's dark comedy and over-the-top violence.:::0:::None
Kick-Ass gains significant momentum in its second half, once it abandons the arch origin-story material and starts staking a claim as a straight-up action flick.:::1:::3/5
Fast, funny, and a hell of a lot of fun, Vaughn's film does, indeed, live up to the brash punch of its title.:::1:::3.5/4
... It feels fresh, with an edge about it that allows you to think anything can happen to any character at any time.:::1:::A
Both its plot and inconsistent message seem little more than an excuse to show us a man explode inside an industrial-strength microwave.:::0:::None
Most of the lessons in Kick-Ass are juvenile, but Lordy are they stylishly told.:::1:::A
Defiantly irreverent and gleefully violent.:::1:::B-
The movie just decided that thoughtlessness and splatter was its own reward. I'm okay with that.:::1:::3.5/5
Never has a title been so true, so funny, and so simple as that of Kick-Ass.:::1:::4.5/5
Kick-Ass is so refreshingly iconoclastic, it's a wonder it was made at all.:::1:::None
Kick-Ass is such an exciting, refreshing development in comic book filmmaking that I want to shout it from the rooftops:::1:::4/4
Kick Ass is about as exciting as movies get. Not just because it is a (mostly) anarchic splatter-fest that celebrates (nay, encourages) acts of ridiculous violence, but also the fact that it was made completely outside of the studio system.:::1:::4/5
A bait-and-switch movie that lucks out because its switch is so much more appealing than its bait.:::1:::6/10
Your appreciation will depend in how much you can appreciate it's utter wrongness as a twisted virtue.:::1:::None
America could probably use a good laugh just about now, what with all the problems plaguing this society. But the exploitation of children even if they are actors and the special effects are occasionally awesome, is way beyond just not cool.:::0:::None
A genre dress-up play date from hell.:::0:::C-
Uma diversao atipica: choca e provoca o riso na mesma medida, conseguindo tambem privilegiar seus personagens sem jamais sacrificar a historia.:::1:::4/5
Finally, a comic-book superhero movie for people who are sick to death of comic-book superhero movies.:::1:::None
A serviceable two hours with some entertaining moments...:::1:::None
It's deeply immoral to turn a ten year old girl into The Bride from "Kill Bill" and pretend it's just a cartoon.:::0:::0/5
Kick-Ass speaks volumes about where our entertainment is heading. We can either take noisy offense or go along for the grisly and giddy ride.:::1:::4/5
Beware, beware of films designed to tickle Comic Book Guy's undercarriage:::0:::None
it doesn't follow a formula, but...there is a certain point in the movie where things do start to become a little conventional.:::1:::3/4
This adaptation of Mark Millar's comic books has enough biting wit and bone crunching action to justify the title.:::1:::4/5
This is the good stuff.:::1:::4/5
No one moment is like any others, and for some this will prove simply exhausting, while for others it will be positively exhilarating.:::1:::3/4

When the movie is cool, it's very, very cool %u2014 and when it's disturbing, it's very, very disturbing.:::0:::2.5/4
Hit Girl flips like a gymnast, curses like a sailor, kills like a maniac and ignites yet another useful if irresolvable debate on the limits of screen violence, the desensitization of the culture and the wisdom of exploiting children for entertainment.:::1:::3/4
I found it mighty painful sitting through all the bone crushing and blood-letting.:::0:::D+
As long as Kick-Ass remains focused on Dave and his exploits in and out of costume, it remains a clever modern riff on the classic Marvel tale, like watching Peter Parker's travails reimagined for Napoleon Dynamite. But this is only half the movie.:::0:::2/4
Kick-Ass is only half right.:::0:::2.0/4.0
The movie gives us good reason to ask why we've become so accustomed to adults behaving like invulnerable comic-book characters in pretty much every action movie, even those with serious pretensions.:::1:::7/10
Matthew Vaughn and company turn the super hero image on its ear, reinventing the genre.:::1:::B+
The select audience it is aimed for will thoroughly enjoy it while the rest of us will suffer through it.:::0:::4/10
The best comic book screen adaptation since The Dark Knight!:::1:::4/4
It isn't terribly good, nor terribly fun, nor terribly anything - not even terribly violent, though you've probably heard otherwise from an assortment of moral scolds.:::0:::5/10
Certainly entertaining enough as an action film and it works well enough as a love story, but there are some serious problems with the dramatic portions of the film and its warped moral message.:::1:::B
However the film also has major pacing issues, is pretty damned boring and saddles the audience with the least interesting character in the entire film, Kick-Ass. As a result I felt the film was simply o.k. when it could have been much, much better.:::1:::3/5
Comic scribe Mark Millar and director Matthew Vaughn's pitch-black love letter to the genre, Wertham's greatest fear is fully realized in an irresponsible blitzkrieg of irony-tinged fun.:::1:::84/100
This film delivers on that fantasy with a world where bad guys are real and superheroes are geeky high school comic-book fans.:::1:::3.5/4
The funniest, tongue-in-cheekiest, most outrageous version of a superhero ever.:::1:::4/4
I know it's all supposed to be tongue in cheek and lots of fun, but frankly this turned my stomach.:::0:::None
When filmmakers nudge a child into viewing savagery as slapstick, are we not allowing them to do what we condemn in the pornographer -- that is, to coarsen and inflame?:::0:::None
Kick-Ass is ultra-funny, ultra-silly and ultra-geeky, but what Kick-Ass mostly is, is monumentally cool - this is the film the kids will be swearing about.:::1:::5/5
Smart, fast-moving, and deadly, this flick makes all the right moves as an adult tale of revenge sparked with black humor that is a hair-trigger removed from tragedy:::1:::4/5
'Kick-Ass' OWNS.:::1:::4/4
With an overload of characters and contrasts and disconnects, Kick-Ass tears itself apart. And that leaves its ultra violence untenable.:::0:::2/4

Kick-Ass lives up to its name ...:::1:::3/4
The movie has a high cool quotient for sure, but it also has some substance underneath it all. This is an enormously entertaining film that offers plenty of style, humor, and excitement.:::1:::3.5/4
This movie has everything I love, Comedy, Elvis, Heroes, and Over the top Action all executed perfectly. I left the theater giddy with happiness. Best movie of the year.:::1:::A+
A kick-ass action flick that feels more like 3D than most of the recent films actually employing the technology yet it also manages to comment on the violent action it creates and celebrates.:::1:::9/10
It is violent, it is vulgar and the story is off-the-walls at times. But in the end, Kick-Ass is a relentlessly fun, irreverent film that doesn't even care to take names.:::1:::None
It's painted...like a funny bit of mayhem. That's really a ruse to get you in to have a really balanced but insane movie experience.:::1:::4/5
Things start slowly while introducing the characters, but once the explosive action and over-the-top gore-filled violence begin, this movie becomes an unstoppable dynamo.:::1:::3/4
Gory as a Japanese horror film, action-packed as an early John Woo, hip as prime Tarantino, Matthew Vaughn's riot of fun and violence, Kick-Ass gains singular laurels in the comic fanboy hall of fame.:::1:::4.5/5
An irreverent send-up of comic book movies that's as hilarious as it is badass.:::1:::3.5/4
A rockin', rowdy good time - up to a point. For all its alleged edginess, Kick-Ass actually plays it safe.:::0:::None
With a half dozen superhero movies every year that feel as if they were created by a Hollywood blockbuster machine, it's so refreshing to see one with its own distinct, subversive personality.:::1:::None
Kick-Ass is a movie carefully engineered to appeal to the child in some of us.:::0:::D
After watching very safe PG-13 superhero movies it's refreshing to see a film that's made for us chubby, bearded thirtysomethings that still crack open the polyurethane bags.:::1:::4/5
The longer it goes on, the more revolting it becomes.:::0:::C
On the page and on the screen, Kick-Ass riffs on the wish-fulfillment afforded by tales of derring-do and the ill-advisedness of taking on the task in real life.:::1:::3/4
An exhilarating, brilliant and outrageously funny thrill ride. It's one of the most wildly entertaining, rousing and crowd-pleasing action films of the season.:::1:::8.25/10
Kick-Ass gives the superhero genre a jolt, but you'll feel queasy rooting on an 11-year-old killing machine.:::1:::3/4
Don't tell the people who will line up to see a tween girl kill bad guys, but Kick-Ass is a lot smarter than it might look.:::1:::3/5
In its own lunatic way, it seriously grapples with the foundations of the genre.:::1:::A-
It's an extreme dream that hilariously acknowledges its own ridiculousness every step of the way.:::1:::4/5

The sensitive will surely faint in horror, but there's something incredibly thrilling about a little girl who can mow down a room full of big men with big guns.:::1:::None
Everything you've likely heard about Kick-Ass is true, providing you've heard it's profane, outlandish, ultra-violent, shocking, funny and wildly entertaining.:::1:::B+
Nicolas Cage is a hoot, a hollar and a fright as Damon Mac ready, a.k.a. Big Daddy. How can he be otherwise? He's a good cop gone mad.:::1:::3.5/4
While it's by no means a perfect movie, it often feels like the purest distillation of adolescent male power fantasies ever portrayed on screen.:::1:::3.5/5
The film has the courage of its genre convictions. It doesn't have even a whiff of market testing. It does everything on its own terms, and in this age of McMansion movies, that's a super accomplishment.:::1:::4.5/5
Simply put, Kick-Ass is a lot of fun, but it's packed with edgy content.:::1:::4/5
Fast, periodically spit-funny and often grotesquely violent, the film at once embraces and satirizes contemporary action-film cliches with Tarantino-esque self-regard -- it's the latest in giggles-and-guts entertainment.:::1:::3.5/5
Sitting through "Kick-Ass" is like seeing a Tarantino movie for the first time. Terrible things are happening, and yet, somehow, they're breathtakingly funny.:::1:::4/5
I expected some comedy, some teen angst, some great stunts, and I got them, oh yes. I did not expect mob bosses, crazed double crosses, intense and squibbulous violence, a classic revenge plot, and a pretty decent little love story.If this is even close t:::1:::4.5/5
Amounts to a bunch of clever stuff uselessly circling a void; a superhero comedy without compelling heroes, villains, or subtext.:::0:::C

a fun experience and one of the best representations of the genre put to the big screen yet.:::1:::5/5
Surprisingly, Kick-Ass is the least interesting character in the movie:::1:::3/4
Here, the power is an extra dose of the hallmarks of adolescence-an affect of ennui about everything but smashing through limits and a sense of irony about everything but sex.:::1:::B
Suggested subtitle: Iron Man, You Just Got Served.:::1:::3/4
Prepare for amazement: This thing makes Nicolas Cage cool again.:::1:::3.5/4
A mosh pit of a comic-book movie that dares you to dive into its anarchy.:::1:::3/4
The film is post-modern surgery into the superhero myth, driving a scalpel into the warped logic of misanthropic killers who masquerade as civic do-gooders.:::1:::4/4
Just when you think it is no longer possible to subvert or reinvent an exhausted genre, something like Kick-Ass comes along to blow your presuppositions right out of the water.:::1:::8/10
[It] thinks it's so brave and bold. But it's more like the title character, a dweeb who just thinks he's tough.:::0:::1/5
A couple of times, I was in the middle of thinking, "They did not just do that," when I had to interrupt my own thoughts to think, "OK, maybe they did just do it, but they did not just do that, too!":::1:::3/4
If you're going to play this game, you have to keep doubling down. Kick-Ass can't. The fights never grow in complexity; halfway through, the director has nothing to add.:::0:::2/4
Works early on while focusing on Dave's story, but Big Daddy defines the movie's unpleasant soul.:::0:::1.5/4
Parental Content Review:::1:::None
A film that actually lives up to its title.:::1:::A-
An R-rated invitation to get in touch with your inner 8-year-old, "Kick-Ass" is some of the most cynical mainstream filmmaking I've seen lately. From its high-school-dweeb-turned-superhero hero to its foul-mouthed-11-year-old-killing-machine heroine, it's:::0:::C
A bawdy, bone-crunching, often hilarious, somewhat uneven action comedy brimming with outrageously vulgar jokes.:::1:::B
Taken on its own delightfully twisted terms, it is bold and uncompromising. It knows its audience, and delivers a fable for the ages, deliciously uncensored.:::1:::4/4
For better or for worse, Kick-Ass has been constructed to shock and awe rather than to support and value deep thought.:::0:::2.5/4
It brings together several popular strains of contemporary moviemaking and combines them into one big, shameless, audacious, compulsively watchable, irresistibly likable piece of pure entertainment.:::1:::4/4
...a pop confection that owes as much to Quentin Tarantino as it does to Mark Millar's comic book series and its titular hero isn't really very interesting.:::1:::B-
The picture's saving grace is Hit-Girl, an exuberant cinematic original destined to become iconic. Without her, as the saying goes, the makers would have nothing.:::1:::2.5/4
Peppering an action flick with comedy is hardly original, but the mocking tone and off-kilter vibe set this film apart. It even has a hearty dose of charm, thanks mostly to the most outrageous performance by a child in recent memory.:::1:::3/4
It soars, jet-propelled, on its central idea of matching a superhero's exploits with the grinding reality of urban teen life and on the aerodynamic smoothness of the film's style.:::1:::None
Vaughn cheerfully mines the queasiness of ... contradiction for satire, but the movie takes the reality of its characters seriously. When good guys die, their loss actually stings.:::1:::3/4
Kick-Ass stands as an intriguing fantasy of social networking. To achieve superhero status, you simply put up your own Web site, announce it on MySpace and Facebook and you're on your mythic way.:::1:::None
Vaughn has provided an imperfect but still wickedly hilarious take on Mark Millar's deconstruction of superhero mythos.:::1:::B+
A wonderfully unlikely amalgam of Hong Kong-era John Woo and Shaolin Soccer/Kung Fu Hustle-era Stephen Chow:::1:::4/4
Kick-Ass is being promoted like Watchmen, from the writer of Wanted, and while it has elements of both, it's far more purely entertaining than either.:::1:::A-
I know this would never happen but Chloe Moretz deserves an Oscar for her performance as Hit-Girl. The film perfectly balances graphic stylized violence with major laughs.:::1:::4.5/5
It's as if all the arguments about these hyper-violent films -- why they are so popular, what they have done to our culture -- are open for business in one convenient location.:::1:::4/5
You can tell from scene 1 this was made by someone with vision and conviction, willing to risk offending some so he could wow others. This is no film-by-focus-group. Thank God:::1:::4/4
Kick-Ass is a guilty pleasure of the highest order, a guns-blazing, media-savvy superhero comedy designed to thrill geeks and outrage prudes.:::1:::3.5/4
Vaughn has the spirit and storytelling confidence to tweak superhero movies and in the process deliver a comic-book classic equal to the best of the bunch.:::1:::3.5/4
A bizarre and ultimately self-sabotaging movie that defies categorization, Kick-Ass is at times cheap and cynical, while in other moments is ingenious and strangely noble.:::0:::2.5/4

Kick-Ass has punk energy, ace action moves, and a winning sense of absurdist fun.:::1:::3.5/4
After the deluge of huge, effects-laden superhero blockbusters that has dominated cinemas in the past decade, there's something pleasing in seeing the modestly budgeted Kick-Ass come out of nowhere to provide more imagination and entertainment than almost:::1:::4/4
At some point it becomes exactly the big, boneheaded movie it was making fun of in the first place.:::0:::2.5/4
A film about wannabes who use attitude and bluster to emulate their inspirations, this ersatz blockbuster ends up seeming a little too much like its heroes.:::0:::C+
It's a star-making role for Moretz, but everyone holds their own even in the face of their biggest enemy: lax pacing that makes this fun film drag and lurch.:::1:::B-
This is the ultimate fanboy product.:::0:::None
Memorable performances from Johnson, the terrifically weird Cage and, especially, Moretz as the nimble Hit-Girl, make this an underdog adventure that will have you laughing, gripping your armrest and bursting into applause.:::1:::3/4
Rarely has a film lived up to its title so well!:::1:::4.5/5
By turns scathingly satiric and fan-boy celebratory, ridiculously violent and politically incorrect (at least when it comes to our notions of childhood), Kick-Ass is an absolute hoot.:::1:::3/4
Knowing, impatient, and prone to shuddering violence as both a substitute for plot and shorthand for exhilaration, Kick-Ass oozes a supreme confidence in the knowledge of its audience.:::0:::None
Give Vaughn his due - bubble-gum black comedy (from a Mark Millar comic) is a tough tone to manage, and he mostly hits the mark in Kick-Ass.:::1:::B
Despite flaws and inconsistencies, a geeky teen-superhero flick can be worth seeing.:::1:::B-
"Kick-Ass" isn't just broken by its flaws ... It's flawed to start with, a hypocritical mess whose attempts to swagger turn into clumsy stumbling and whose knowing wink blinds it to its own problems.:::0:::1.5/5
Lurking beneath the flat panels of this adaptation lies a contemporary and sophisticated message about everything from free will to the ambient morality of popular culture.:::1:::3.5/5
The scenario may have pimples, but it doesn't need braces.:::1:::None
Funny, unexpectedly violent romp lets a regular kid play superhero for a while.:::1:::None
With a name like Kick-Ass, you know what you're in for. Or maybe you don't, and that's the beauty of this gloriously entertaining superhero satire.:::1:::4/5
What do these characters consider worthy of killing and dying for? That a protagonist lacks superpowers is no reason for him to lack motivation, conviction, or purpose.:::0:::None
This is the most brazenly funny bloodbath unleashed on the public since Pulp Fiction.:::1:::3.5/4
A particularly timely story about civic-mindedness and the pursuit of fame.:::1:::3/4
It dwells in some morally hazy netherworld that allows it to be, technically, pretty kick-ass without being all that much fun. Heck, even Bruce Wayne had to go to the ninja academy.:::0:::2.5/5
Slick, savvy, ultra-violent send-up, offering a brazen, aptly-named counter-culture diversion.:::1:::7/10
Kick-Ass isn't dangerous, it's juvenile ... like hearing a fourth-grader proudly detonate his first F-bomb in front of a teacher while his friends are watching.:::0:::1.5/4
The promising setup and rousing climax of Matthew Vaughn's film contradict each other and we walk away partly exhilarated but more with the nagging feeling that the questions it raises were never fully explored.:::0:::2.5/4
What should have come across as a darkly funny riff on the likes of "Watchmen" winds up coming across like "Hero at Large" with a significantly higher body count.:::0:::2/5
When a movie's called "Kick-Ass", the best you can hope for is that it lives up to its name. This one lives up to it, and then kicks its ass.:::1:::3.5/4
Kick-Ass slips into a groove most "real" comic book movies can only dream of.:::1:::A-
One of the best revenge flicks since Kill Bill, the badass Kick-Ass is packed with little pockets of awesomeness waiting to be activated.:::1:::4/5
All is slick, stylish, well-made and totally amoral. The characters are amusing, the dialogue is racy.:::1:::3/5
I started hating this movie around the midpoint.:::0:::1.5/4
Let's say you're a big fan of the original comic book, and you think the movie does it justice. You know what? You inhabit a world I am so very not interested in.:::0:::1/4
So in love with itself and its own supposed transgressions that it loses sight of the fact that it's become the very thing it's supposed to be taking down.:::0:::2/5
Kick-Ass earns its name in every way.:::1:::3.5/4
Watching this four-and-a-half-foot-tall schoolgirl -- a type that is usually the epitome of movie victimization -- rise up, lay waste to legions of bad guys, and battle to save the day should rouse everyone's inner child to cheers of vindication.:::1:::3.5/4
For all its posturing, Kick-Ass doesn't risk taking the superhero genre seriously and hence is all too happy to be impotent.:::0:::None
It will soon be a well-known part of the comic book movie pantheon.:::1:::None
I want to return to this hyper-violent, awesome world and get lost in laughs and sympathetic pain again.:::1:::10/10
While not all of the elements fit together tonally, on the surface level -- the level that the title suggests -- Kick-Ass does exactly what it's supposed to, as long as you're game for the language and the gutting.:::1:::4/5
Is it a problem that Kick-Ass is by far the most violent movie ever to feature kids as heroes? Parents should consider themselves warned, though personally, I just wish that the film had ended up a bit less of an over-the-top action ride.:::1:::B+
[T]he notion of a comic-book geek who has not read Watchmen is akin to a serious thespian who has never heard of that Hamlet dude...:::0:::None
Kick Ass. It's epic. Intimate. Genuine and genuinely messed-up.:::1:::4/5
Kick-Ass seems to have cult hit written all over it, except that in this interactive age, cults have gone mainstream. The box office should be massive.:::1:::3/5
Based on the comic of the same name, Kick Ass combines elements of superhero films, dark comedies and strong action flicks, and it does them extremely well.:::1:::None
Action and comedy is no new cocktail, but there's something striking about the particular blend in Kick-Ass.:::1:::None
Despite the violence and the swearing, Kick-Ass has something you don't usually see in superhero films: charm.:::1:::4/5
Kick-Ass is a gloriously bloodthirsty action romp that is funny, violent and stunningly entertaining.:::1:::5/5
Johnson sports an inflexion-perfect American accent as the eponymous do-gooder and Cage delivers his first decent performance for years, but it's pint-sized Moretz who steals the show.:::1:::None
Doing for superheroes what Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels did for gangsters, Kick-Ass is colourful, irreverent, Tarantino-ish fun, especially when the brilliantly oddball Cage is on screen.:::1:::None
For those of us who find somber superhero movies faintly ridiculous, Kick-Ass is a one-film justice league.:::1:::4/5
Never as shocking as it thinks it is, as funny as it should be, or as engaged in cultural critique as it could be.:::0:::None
Director Matthew Vaughn has made an action comedy so bloody funny -- double emphasis on bloody -- fans might need to see it again just to catch the gags they missed from laughing so hard the first time.:::1:::None
Kick-Ass is a rabid puppy of a movie, energetically bounding off the screen and into your lap, where it proceeds to chew off your face.:::1:::3/4
I won't bore you with the plot. Just go, OK?:::1:::4/5
It's all about tone -- dark enough to be anarchic, playful enough to amuse.:::1:::4/5
Crude, bloody and moody, Kick-Ass embraces, at arm's length, its fanboy origins. But maybe they should have decided if they loved these stereotypes, or wanted to ridicule them to death before rolling the camera.:::0:::2/4
A tone-deaf pantsing of the superman cause, creating an incredible ruckus as it breakdances on hallowed ground, preferring noise over wit when it comes to giving funny books a comprehensive noogie.:::0:::C
At odds with itself, initially a darkly comic indictment of fanboy fanaticism carried to its logically violent ends before succumbing to the very superhero formula that it purports to subvert.:::1:::None
As a subversive dissection of a genre, the film has no grit or imagination, and as a work of stock wham-bam entertainment, it's a sloppy trifle, merely the latest piece of disposable Friday night mainstream-cinema juvenilia.:::0:::1.5/4
Big on energy and boasting some fine performances, "Kick Ass" is also too juvenile in its irreverence and too enraptured in its bloodletting:::1:::None
Crazily inspired....If you can stomach the violence--cartoonish but still abrasive--you'll find it giddy fun and almost shamefully enjoyable.:::1:::B+
We never thought we'd say this about a movie, but Kick-Ass is too violent . . .:::0:::None
The real star of the film is young Moretz, whose caped crusader "Hit Girl" is one of the baddest super heroes to grace the screen.:::1:::A
The first great alternative to our superhero movie era, and one that comes dazzlingly, if a little frustratingly, close to perfection.:::1:::4/5
Kick-Ass is a compendium of all sleazy things, and it sings like a siren to our inner Tarantinos.:::1:::None
If only Kick-Ass were as nervy and entertaining as its brazen title. Unfortunately, the weakest part of Kick-Ass is, well, Kick-Ass himself.:::0:::None
Fanboy culture reaches an apogee of sloppy diminishing returns intended to clearly draw a dividing line between adult fanboy poseurs and the under-17 crowd who can only get into the R-rated picture with the accompaniment of said pandering grown-up.:::0:::D-
A fanboy's kick-ass wet dream of a movie that could be a surprise spring smash. Kick-Ass has it all, the triumphant comic book movie fans have been waiting for.:::1:::4/5
The film's misjudged moments and uneven tone make it incapable of sweeping the audience away with the absurd, innocent exhilaration of the 'what if' premise.:::0:::None
This ribald romp, thanks to its unrelenting violence, ultimately outstays its welcome.:::0:::2.5/5
An extremely funny, extremely violent, gloriously foul-mouthed and decidedly adult comic-book adventure that offers the most refreshing reboot of the genre since 2008's Hancock.:::1:::3/5
The film is amusing, but it's gaspingly inconsequential.:::0:::2.5/5
The fact that an 11-year-old is doing the killing -- shooting and stabbing bad guys -- all of whom die very bloodily -- will be understandably concerning for many.:::0:::2.5/5
A lazy script makes for a cheesy and predictable film that features two crummy performances from stars who are hard to dislike.:::0:::3/10
A ridiculous and lifeless comedy, this mess of a motion picture is trite and easily-forgettable.:::0:::0.5/5
Robert Luketic's "Killers" takes a worn out premise and somehow manages to make it feel even more tired than before.:::0:::2/4
A fluffy but harmless action comedy.:::0:::5/10
Everything has a thrown-together feel, as the characters are tossed from romcom situations to action set-pieces and back again with no thought to applying any sort of grace notes to ease the transition.:::0:::2/5
Robert Luketic's latest flick is a palette cleanser -- a flavourless sorbet if you will -- guaranteed to scrape the flavor of any recent enjoyable film from your sensory memory.:::0:::2/5
Bland spy rom-com mines violence, stereotypes for laughs.:::0:::2/5
Perhaps some future social scientist will explain why the traditional romantic comedy transformed during the first decade of the 21st century into the screwball action-comedy, in which bonds of love are strengthened by gunplay, car chases and explosions.:::0:::2/4
Neither action nor romance, Killers will please all those who see it for Kutcher, disappoint those in search of a story.:::1:::3/5
I was tested by Killers' gaping lack of a single distinguishing characteristic.:::0:::1/5
The murderously boring Killers firmly belongs in the dregs of the ever increasing number of rom-com-action movies.:::0:::1.5/5
A concept masquerading as a full blown movie, in which the story is undercooked but the delivery is overdone:::0:::None
The storyline and script lack credibility, but more than that, Robert Luketic's direction misses the light, crisp fun the situations require, leaving us saddled with a questionable tone in Nowhereland:::0:::None
Heigl and Kutcher's romance has about as much crackle as a bowl of soggy Rice Bubbles.:::0:::1/5
Far from the knock out we hope for.:::0:::None
full review at Movies for the Masses:::0:::1.5/5
It's trying to be funny and it's trying to be cool but Killers doesn't quite get there.:::0:::C+
A bloated mess that's not remotely funny -- or suspenseful.:::0:::1/5
The script is ludicrously overcooked, with too much unnecessary exposition at the expense of laughs, while Heigl's habitual decision to play each role as a nostril-flaring, wild-eyed, squealing shrew is growing tiresome.:::0:::None
It's pretty much dead in the water as soon as a shirtless Kutcher tries to play suave and utters some terrible French in his first attempt to woo his co-star.:::0:::1/4
Only the underplaying Selleck gets out of this with any dignity, while O'Hara is totally wasted as Jen's one-note tippling mom.:::0:::1/5
Call us critics jaded, but Killers puts the "kill" in "kill-joy." Try it and see for yourself. Or not.:::0:::C-
Killers goes wrong so quickly and obviously it's almost hard to believe -- did collective deafness strike on set?:::0:::1/4
The whole film is scripted like it didn't matter, and directed in a similar fashion.:::0:::1/5
100 minutes killed, to be precise.:::0:::2/5
Heigl and Kutcher are both easy on the eye but neither of them quite have the charisma required to overcome the flat script and uninspired direction.:::0:::2/5
Vapid movie stars screeching their way through frantically edited action sequences.:::0:::2/5
Killers feels like the build-up of Mr And Mrs Smith, only that's the whole movie and the chronic lack of a third act when even the second act is wafer thin is almost unforgivable.:::0:::2/5
Kutcher and Heigl have such forced chemistry that it's hard to believe they'd ever fall in love, much less stay married in blissful blah-dom.:::0:::2/5
It's us they are killing with this screamingly abysmal romcom-thriller, drearily similar to the hitman'n'her Brangelina picture Mr & Mrs Smith.:::0:::1/5
What have moviegoers done to deserve releases like these?:::0:::None
Kutcher and Heigl are unable to bring any warmth to what is at heart a bitter, cynical script. Just awful.:::0:::1/5
It's better than The Bounty Hunter, with the two leads making a more charming couple than Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler, but it's still difficult to view Killers as anything more than throwaway fluff.:::0:::2/5
The script's bowel-rupturingly bland - you can almost sense the bits where they wrote [INSERT JOKE HERE] and never got round to it.:::0:::2/5
Katherine Heigl and Robert Luketic are like The Osmond Siblings of the movie world.:::0:::2/5
Heigl and Kutcher make a cute enough couple, but a cringeworthy opening and ludicrous (even by the standards of the genre) ending mean that this is one to watch only when your brain is switched to the "off" position.:::0:::2/5
I laughed a few times and was fairly entertained. I just wish it had a better structure and not such a flat ending.:::1:::3/5
A disjointed and unnecessarily lengthy comedy which has a number of flaws but still manages to garner enough laughs throughout to make it worth a watch.:::1:::3/5
This should be and could be a really fun and entertaining, silly movie and it isn't.:::0:::None
Certainly no worse - faint praise alert - than your average sitcom.:::0:::2/5
A boobs 'n biceps fluffy espionage burb romance, helped in no small part by a host of unlikely everyday unneighborly assassins. Though a homicidal Kutcher, recently caught with his pants down as a conniving baby-faced gigolo in Spread, is another matter.:::1:::None
Just how wretched an actress is Katherine Heigl? Ashton Kutcher has delivered his own share of poor performances, yet whenever he's asked to share a scene with Heigl, he comes across like Laurence Olivier by comparison.:::0:::1/4
Killers is a lifeless romantic action comedy that might as well have been concocted in a broken beaker, given the paucity of chemistry between the lead actors.:::0:::1.5/4
There is a potentially rich satirical situation there, as everyone in the couple's dull planned community turn out to be undercover killers. But whatever germ of an idea there is, it's quickly killed by witless writing and migraine-inducing direction.:::0:::1.5/4
If you count the number of hairstyles Katherine Heigl wears in this dreary romcom-with-guns, the tally is likely to be four or five. Ashton Kutcher's facial expressions, one.:::0:::None
If you think the trailers look bad, just imagine how insufferable the movie is.:::0:::3.5/4
It's as if you'd tuned into an episode of Punk'd with Kutcher parading around in full Bond parody -- not good.:::0:::1/4
This thing is a mess -- as a comedy, as a thriller, as an action vehicle, as a movie.:::0:::D+
This is not a bad movie. It is three bad movies. "Killers" is trying to be a romantic action comedy and it fails all three times.:::0:::D
The comedic talents of Luketic, Kutcher, and Heigl overcome a dismal script, a ludicrous contrived setup, and innumerable plot holes.:::1:::7/10
For someone so classically handsome, Kutcher is surprisingly anticharismatic as a star. A smarmy grin and looking good while shirtless does not equal screen presence, dude.:::0:::2/5
The film's awareness of subterfuge and assassination as contemporary habit represents a change in how people perceive loving, citizenship and morality.:::0:::None
little more than a potentially good idea badly executed:::0:::2/4
Starts out fresh and funny but quickly bogs down and never recovers. Heigl and Kutcher drown with the silly plot:::0:::4/10
Maybe filmmakers should shoot what Ashton's up to off-camera, because not many laughs are making it to the screen.:::0:::1/4
Bob DeRosa and Ted Griffin wrote the script, whose plummeting one-liners leave no actor unscathed.:::0:::None
It's to die for. Seriously, you could kill yourself. The script is idiotic. The leads display little chemistry. The deathly struggles go on so long that we pray that both sides collapse from boredom before we do.:::0:::2/10
A sour action comedy that delivers few thrills and even fewer laughs.:::0:::None
Bungled rather than flat-out terrible.:::0:::None
Director Robert Luketic has confused helming a frothy action romp through silliness with remaking Ingmar Bergman's Scenes from A Marriage. Star Katherine Heigl may be many things, Liv Ullman is not one of them:::0:::0/5
...an acceptable time-waster that just barely gets the job done.:::1:::2.5/4
Occasionally, a production company is so acutely aware that it's stuck with a dud that they refuse to schedule press screenings, hoping the public will blindly buy tickets. This is just such a loser.:::0:::2/10
You could do far worse at the multiplex this weekend than Killers, a modestly pitched rom-com actioner that outdoes most of the competition on compulsive watchability alone.:::1:::2.5/4
I found 'Killers' mostly fun and suspenseful to watch, despite its intermittent blah dialogue and schmaltzy ending.:::1:::None
Killers is a forgettable waste that will have you wanting to kill to get that part of your life back.:::0:::2.5/10
Worth the investment for the cinematic capture of the Southern France backdrops, as well as the badinage between Heigl and Kutcher reminiscent of those classic Doris Day-Rock Hudson exchanges in flicks like Send Me No Flowers. Send Me No Hit Men!:::1:::2.5/4
Banal, asinine and frustratingly preposterous while lacking chemistry, laughs or even a modicum of cleverness.:::0:::2.75/10
Overall, "Killers" makes for good quick, date-movie-ish entertainment, but it's hard to hold it against anyone who would find the whole thing an unbearable mess.:::0:::C+
This hybrid of marital strife and action comedy barely worked in Date Night, but that's because Steve Carell and Tina Fey were authentic as married grown-ups.:::0:::1.5/4
At a certain point, it actually becomes embarrassing to watch Heigl and Kutcher play at being in love.:::0:::1/4
Other than being an utterly miscast, ill-advised combo of rom-com and spy thriller distinguished by lousy writing and featuring two people with no screen chemistry, Killers is perfectly mediocre.:::0:::1/5
There's nobody delivering the laughs in this arid action comedy.:::0:::1.5/4
The mismatch isn't quite of Justin Bieber-Charlize Theron proportions, but Ashton Kutcher and Katherine Heigl play an oddly disjointed pair of lovers, partners and reluctant assassins in Killers.:::0:::None
Ashton Kutcher produces his latest film, the Robert Luketic-directed romantic-action-comedy-thriller, which is very light on romance, well-choreographed action, laughs or thrills.:::0:::D-
Killers does have a couple of good punch lines, but in the context of all of the film's other shortcomings, it's difficult to laugh and betray any enjoyment at all.:::0:::None
Is it some monstrosity of awfulness, as its lack of advance screening suggested? No, that would imply at least a spark of some kind. This is just an empty summer hodgepodge of stale romantic comedy exchanges, witlessness and lackluster action.:::0:::0.5/5
The screenplay has pages I imagine remain only half-filled. Not long after Heigl and Kutcher meet in an elevator, they share this exchange. She: "Huh-huh." He: "Huh." She: "Huuuuuh." This is the language of love for two people coming out of a coma.:::0:::1/4
Killers leaves Heigl and Kutcher to bicker over issues of trust and betrayal; being in danger causes more problems in their marriage than it resolves. Killers isn't an entertainment, it's a high-speed spat.:::0:::D
It's the summer movie equivalent of Cheetos -- totally unnatural, bad for you, possibly cancerous, but a guilty pleasure to indulge in with your girlfriends, possibly while drunk.:::1:::None
Don't tell me I'm making too much out of nothing, because the steady drip-drip-drip of nothings like this are killing us all.:::0:::D
It's so ineffectual and unfocused that after it's over, you're not even sure you watched a movie.:::0:::5.5/10
What does work here has little to do with the leads, but rather some scene-stealing performances from Tom Selleck and Catherine O'Hara as Heigl's overprotective parents.:::0:::C-
A brain-deadening collision of high concept and low standards.:::0:::0.5/5
Haven't we seen the oh-my-gosh-my-spouse-is-secretly-an-assassin-but-you-know-a-nice-one routine once too often?:::0:::1/4
Robert Luketic's bland action comedy focuses on the uninteresting relationship between itsen the gleefully anarchic impulses of his early New Queer Cinema efforts and the newfound technical control of Mysterious Skin.:::1:::3/4
Funny, sexy and mad, Kaboom may not be vintage Araki, but it's more than worth watching regardless.:::1:::None
:::1:::3/5
:::0:::None
 two bland main characters, and that's the deadliest thing in sight.:::0:::1/5
Luketic and Heigl are totes besties when it comes to setting women back half a century, to the time when women were believed to be nothing more than adorable children and that's the way it should be.:::0:::None
Mindnumbingly boring and unfunny ... throws a bunch of things that wouldn't necessarily work together onto the screen hoping movie audiences are too dumb to care.:::0:::3/10
Yeah, Ashton Kutcher's a CIA agent. And I'm Pauline Kael.:::0:::1/5
Kutcher's reputation as a shrewd businessman just got knocked beneath the basement.:::0:::D-
After this bomb, Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher may qualify as two of the most attractive and prematurely washed-up screen actors Hollywood has ever produced.:::0:::1/5
Bullets fly and jokes land with a thud.:::0:::None
A dreadful rip-off of 'True Lies'...a disaster so complete that...it will easily earn a high place among the year's worst pictures.:::0:::F
The audience is the real victim.:::0:::None
It's not a perfect film and it's not a piece of cinematic refuse, but Killers is able to find happiness in the middle:::0:::2.5/5
Everybody's cyber-pal Ashton Kutcher is perfect casting for Killers, since the screenplay is shallow as a Tweet and the movie appears to have been shot with a Nikon point-and-click camera he plugs on TV.:::0:::D-
Meant to be a wild, witty and playful comedy-actioner, Killers disappoints on both counts, unfolding as a series of ideas and cliches borrowed from pictures like To Catch a Thief, True Lies, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and others.:::0:::D
It's slightly miscast (Kutcher) and once again Heigl isn't given a character worth remembering. So for me, my mind wanders, and wonders if there was really a good enough reason to make Killers.:::0:::4/10
Have you seen True Lies? Well, then you have already seen Killers minus the great action scenes, great performances and a clever script.:::0:::2/5
Even if Lady Gaga herself were to turn up to meet you in the bleachers during the screening, there is no earthly reason for anyone to spend their time or money on "Killers,":::0:::None
And if [Killers] proves anything, it proves that Lionsgate can make a big stupid noisy "comedy" that is almost entirely laugh-free, just like the big studios.:::0:::None
What have audiences done to deserve this? Summer 2010 has been a roundly disappointing season for movies, but no major release so far has been as brazenly low-rent as Killers.:::0:::1/5
Dares to be a little more dangerous and different, darting from black comedy to action to romance with a smooth hand. Madcap and surprising in a lot of ways.:::1:::2.5/4
Predictability is the least of this picture's concerns. Luketic doesn't provide any whiff of excitement, kinetic energy, or snappy repartee -- there's not a laugh or a thrill around.:::0:::D+
:::0:::1.5/4
Cena?s a game actor, but imagining him in the same gene pool as the petite Clarkson or the scrawny Graye is too much of a stretch.:::0:::1.5/4
Not nearly cinematic enough or well-written enough to take that doozy of a step that so often separates "inspirational" and "hokey.":::0:::2/4
As schmaltzy after-school special/Hallmark Hall of Fame family fare goes, Legendary isn't so bad.:::0:::82/100
There is something comical about the way the movie tries to integrate Cena's massively muscled torso into its chosen atmosphere of casual realism. He looks like something out of Transformers.:::0:::C
Clarkson cries on cue, perhaps recalling what an awful film she's in.:::0:::None
Follows a straight narrative line to its cliched ending without a deviation from formula.:::0:::2.5/5
Predictable but moving sports drama goes beyond wrestling.:::0:::2/5
Even in our current culture of devalued vocabulary, it takes a lot of chutzpah to make a movie about a high school kid who wins a few wrestling matches and title it 'Legendary.':::0:::1.5/4
This isn't paint by numbers - it's color by numbers, with dull crayons. The only reason to see it is if you happen to want to be a Patricia Clarkson completist.:::0:::None
Exactly what you might expect, right down to the montage of blindfolded tussling, jogging and high-fives to the tune of unrelenting inspirational music.:::0:::2/4
It may not live up to that grandiose title, but this rousingly sweet little flick is certainly nothing to go out of your way to avoid.:::1:::3/4
A by-the-numbers sports drama with a death grip on cliches and acting every bit as flat as the mat...:::0:::1.5/4
Stix Dig Hick Pix? A firmly Middle American high-school drama, set in small-town Oklahoma, about classical wrestling, starring a sports-entertainment wrestler and produced by World Wrestling Entertainment.:::0:::None
The kind of fake movie that you sometimes see in the background of real movies as a joke.:::0:::1/5
Legendary relies heavily on veteran actors Patricia Clarkson and Danny Glover. However good they are, they're incapable of making it any better than a made-for-TV movie.:::0:::2.5/5
Patricia Clarkson's charismatic warmth elevates an awkward inspirational sports drama.:::0:::None
Better thesped and helmed than its schmaltzy premise probably warrants.:::1:::None
Every emotional moment is punctuated by plinking piano, and every wrestling match is underscored by hard rock.:::0:::2/4
An unpretentious film with a predictable storyline benefits from some sharp dialog and the always watchable Patricia Clarkson.:::1:::B-
Riddled with as many predictable moves as any pro wrestling match...so trite a collection of cliches that it wouldn't even pass muster as a Hallmark special.:::0:::C-
For a movie with a star wrestler at the center of it, Legendary doesn't pack much of a punch.:::0:::2/4
A school wrestling drama so mired in family-film cliches it can never shake loose the suspicion that -- not unlike certain high-gloss mat bouts -- the emotional fix is in from the get-go.:::0:::1.5/5
Will the whole family come together and heal its wounds? The answer is as contrived as the outcome of a WWE match.:::0:::2/5
Like the inspirational sagas that show up on low-grade cable, Legendary follows a familiar blueprint designed for maximum feel-good effect.:::0:::2/4
1985's Vision Quest is still the best movie on the subject, and that isn't saying much.:::0:::1.5/4
low-key and refreshingly simple:::0:::3/5
Finally, WWE Studios has made a film that wouldn't feel out of place on the Hallmark Channel.:::0:::C
Through all the emotional heaves and tosses, Cena is dead on. Unfortunately, the direction by Mel Damski isn't.:::0:::2.5/4
Legendary is so intent on paying heartfelt tribute to dogged young athletes that it neglects basic story needs.:::0:::2/4
It's a feel-good Kleenex(TM) dispenser of a movie, and there's nothing necessarily wrong with that, but it's routine Hallmark Hall of Afterschool Special material.:::0:::2/4
A well-meaning dud that'll put you out faster than a sleeper hold.:::0:::C-
The script, by actor turned writer John Well, at least someone is trying to emulate the Farrelly brothers -- except "Knucklehead," director Michael W. Watkins' half-assed, halfhearted attempt to copy the Farrellys' out-there style is missing both their jackassical riffs and their heart.:::0:::1/5
World Wrestling Entertainment continues its effort to meld violent sport with gooey, throwback family comedy in the claptrap road movie Knucklehead.:::0:::2.5/5
Wight is appealing, but let's hope he gets better opportunities than this.:::0:::1.5/4
Knucklehead's candy corn heart and shameless predictability are almost touching in their obliviousness to anything that's happened in movies in recent decades. Cute orphans? Really?:::0:::1/4
The ho-hum premise picks up steam as the goofy humor escalates during the course of this bumpy road movie. Kicking off with a synagogue showdown with the infamous Kosher Killer, and later fearsome female sidebars including sisters of mercy who nun up.:::1:::None
A schmaltzy family comedy that won't pass the smell test for kids, parents, or even stoner second cousins.:::0:::None
Those multi-media moguls at World Wrestling Entertainment haven't quite got the hang of this "family friendly" turn they've taken with their motion picture division.:::0:::1.5/4
The perfect follow-up to "Jackass" if only because it's equally moronic, although in this case, it's not even remotely funny.:::0:::3.5/10
A distinctly shameless and shoddily made family comedy, this WWE production for wrestler Big Show turns an already saccharine plot into a toxic, fart-laden piledriver.:::0:::1/5
If a WWE-produced film can't get squared-circle action right, what can be expected of it?:::0:::.5/4

There are so many things that could have been done with this premise that the movie simply doesn't do. Doesn't even think of doing.:::0:::None
An utterly ludicrous entry in the biblical-horror subgenre.:::0:::1/5
Why spend your money watching an extended trailer?:::0:::None
I really enjoyed this stupid movie.:::1:::2.5/5
Heaven help these fallen angels.:::0:::1.5
A bold faced rip off of the "Terminator" films...:::0:::None
A few minutes shorter, and an ending that doesn't outright quote the beginning of the movie, and we might have had something here.:::1:::3/5
...a disappointingly uneven and thoroughly pointless horror effort...:::0:::2/4
"It's a labored, darkly photographed, cringingly acted hodgepodge of fanciful geek-bait genre ideas and hideous connect-the-dots scripting. Who knew the end of the world could be such a screaming bore.":::0:::D
Inane dialogue, a bad, derivative storyline and evil angels make up this overblown, poor-man's would-be Terminator in which an exploding upside-down crucified man is one of the low points. Just when you think the film couldn't get any worse, it does.:::0:::None
It's up to the Archangel Michael (Paul Bettany) to save the human race - or at least the denizens of a desert diner - after a disappointed God loses his temper and sets off the Apocalypse.:::0:::67/100
While entertaining--and you do get the Angel Explodo--it does stretch its silliness factor just a bit much.:::0:::2/5
Ah well. At least we know Paul Bettany's mortgage is covered.:::0:::1/4
Strangers thrown together by fate are trapped inside an isolated diner as zombies converge outside %u2014 an army sent by God to clean out humankind.:::1:::None
Oh, what a wacky bunch of stereotypes in this diner! There's a rich guy, a black person and even Dennis Quaid!:::0:::None
In the end, you're left wondering why the Almighty has so much trouble disposing of a small group hiding out in a diner and why Paul Bettany signed up for such a pointless venture in the first place.:::0:::1/5
Legion has the audacity to set itself up for sequels without giving the audience enough compelling reason to care about this first installment.:::0:::0/4
Could have been T2 with seraphs, or Assault On Precinct 13 crossed with Revelations. Instead, it's a lazy genre bore. Doesn't bode well for Priest, the next Stewart/Bettany film in the pipeline.:::0:::1/5
Celestial tosh of less than Biblical proportions.:::0:::2/5
The sort of confused mess liable to provoke an apocalyptic cull of humanity by any rational supreme being with an interest in cinema.:::0:::2/5
Bettany's job: rescuing the modern Mary, a skanky waitress, and saving her unborn child. Our job: holding back the laughter.:::0:::2/5
The first time, God did it with a flood. Now he's doing it with creepy monsters who can only be repelled with deafening fire from sexy weapons. At least it will keep you awake.:::0:::2/5
The movie is close to a guilty pleasure but it is also a very silly, crummily-scripted mess with no idea how to get from one sequence to the next in that way they call... storytelling?:::0:::2/5
Angels with machine guns? It was probably great fun to make; just don't expect to have quite as good a time watching it. As a piece of action horror it suffers from an identity crisis.:::0:::2/5
ILM visual effects wizkid turned Director Scott Stewart has (literally and metaphorically) thrown up the world's dullest horror actioner, although its premise and beginning do at least offer some promise.:::0:::2/5
First-time feature director Scott Stewart is a former ILM special effects wizard who's been given the keys to the store and it shows. There's little sense of narrative cohesion - or any explanation for the moments of madness.:::1:::3/5
More than a little silly, it veers between high camp and supernatural hokum as an overqualified cast gives the portentous, Bible-based action far more conviction than it deserves.:::1:::3/5
Apocalyptic sci-fi movies are becoming regrettably common, and Legion is the daftest yet.:::0:::1/5
Despite the religious trappings, Legion is an old fashioned shoot-'em-up with satisfying gunfights, a pacey plot and barely a dull moment. Dumb fun.:::1:::3/5
By the tedious climax, the desert setting was reminding me a lot of Resident Evil: Extinction, except this isn't as good.:::0:::2/5
I haven't had more fun since Eight Legged Freaks.:::1:::4/5
More apocalyptic twaddle, this time the setting a scuzzy diner named Paradise Falls - groan - on the edge of the Mojave Desert.:::0:::1/5
If you like biblical tales and fancy a bit of action mixed with angelic references this will be worth a rental. The main message is, have faith. But be warned, this film will test yours.:::0:::2/5
At the end of the day - or should that be end of days - it boils down to nothing more than a glorified apocalyptic zombie movie.:::0:::2/5
A series of set pieces offer individual moments of self-satisfied gratuity, but collectively add up to precious little.:::0:::2/5
If it wasn't taking itself so bloody seriously one could at least laugh with it, but as it stands Legion is a film that one can't help but laugh at.:::0:::1/5
Entertainingly trashy thriller, elevated by strong performances and some gleefully over-the-top moments.:::1:::3/5
That flat middle chunk is the problem, the only thing keeping it from being a respectably stupid B-movie.:::0:::C
Angels we have heard on high. coming down to kick our sorry butts. God can't make up his mind whether he wants humans to survive like they did after the great flood. The battle of the ages singles down on a pregnant woman about to give birth to a holy:::0:::C-
There's nothing wrong with being preposterous, but this guilty pleasure thriller has a tendency to be pretentious as well.:::0:::3/5
Winged things are flitting in two movies, one of which is aimed at adults and the other which is aimed at children. Neither of them is worth seeing.:::0:::.5/4
God could have saved himself a lot of trouble if he'd only have taken the words to 'You Can't Always Get What You Want' to heart.:::0:::1/5
[A] mediocre picture.:::0:::None
There's a lot going on, a lot of theology, a lot of bad horror movie effects.:::0:::None
Legion will have you wishing for the end.:::0:::1.5/4.0
Goofily entertaining, especially when the cast isn't speaking, this rip-roaring blasphemous diversion is worth a gander or two, especially for those who enjoy bug attacks, exploding crucified humans, grossly expandable limbs, and loads of gunfire.:::1:::7/10
Anne Rice was right; angels are just as hot and just as deadly as those bloodsuckers from Twilight and True Blood.:::1:::3.5/5
I'm quite confident Jesus would hate this movie.:::0:::2/5
It's Terminator plus Dogma times Supernatural as set in a Stephen King novel reinterpreted by someone without a sense of humor or knack for dialogue operating on a low budget. But God help me, I liked it!:::0:::2.25/4
A love story and a quest for faith gurgle in the background, but it all fades to exploding stomachs and the Archangel Gabriel's chainsaw.:::0:::1/4
I would prefer to think that Legion was written by a Final Draft program possessed by Pat Robertson's subconscious.:::0:::3/10
The down time between action scenes is deadly dull and the film's hoary cinematic shorthand (i.e., a young Black man enters the film to the sound of hip-hop and fights with his baby mama) is more terrifying than anything else served up.:::0:::None
If you're really that hard up for yet another apocalypso horror show, you'd could do worse than renting 1995's The Prophecy, which at least had the good sense to cast Christopher Walken as the angel Gabriel.:::0:::1/4
Essentially a B-movie dressed up with A-level special effects, Legion looks spiffy but sounds bad with a lot of overwritten dialogue scenes and predictable action.:::0:::2/5
This feature debut by writer-director Scott Stewart may sound like an enjoyably goofy theo-horror romp, but it's a serious penance.:::0:::None
The screenwriters... don't have anything remotely like the training, talent, or the apparent inclination to do anything with this material that is in the least bit entertaining or insightful.:::0:::2/10
Would-be supernatural thriller ... tries too hard to play B-movie material serious and goes straight to hell by the ... second act.:::0:::2/5
Movies don't get much more wick wick wack than this amusingly God-awful -- and yes, that's God with a capital 'G' -- horror-action spectacle that alternates between outrageous camp and sobersided sanctimony as it slouches toward cable immortality...:::0:::2.5/4
Every time an M16 with teflon-coated bullets fires, an angel gets his wings.:::0:::C-
There's a fumbled excuse that "God got tired of the bullshit" and decided to wipe out humanity. In this regard, the audience will probably be on God's side.:::0:::D
A holey mess.:::0:::1.5/4
For maximum enjoyment concentrate on the action and let the theology slide.:::0:::5/10
If you wanted to see a new movie about a dude sportin' a six pack and fluffy white wings, you could do worse than Legion. And by doing worse, you could see Dwayne Johnson snatching spent molars in the family attraction, The Tooth Fairy.:::1:::1.5/4
It's a wonderful life where every time you hear a whelp ring out, another angel gets his head blown off!:::1:::2/4
Films with angels as characters usually fascinate me, but 'Legion' is not one of them. Its story makes no sense, and the movie's religious theme rings false.:::0:::None
Legion is hellishly bad.:::0:::D
Out of the 8 characters that could save the world, I wished 7 would just die and get the apocalypse over with.:::0:::3/10
It's something of a mess, unsuccessfully combining elements of Night of the Living Dead with The Terminator.:::0:::2/5
Often resembles a prime John Carpenter thriller -- call it Assault on Manger 13 -- until an overcaffeinated angel-fu climax significantly lowers the intelligence quotient.:::1:::3/5
End of the world much? As yet ANOTHER twist on the apocalypse, Legion could have done with a lot less pontificating and much more action to mask the muddled plot.:::0:::1.5/4
A faith based shoot 'em up of biblical proportions, with god guns and angel wing weapons of mass destruction. While God's sidekick, a Brit and possible obstetrician, wards off an entire planet of pro-abortion busybodies in his midst.:::0:::None
Legion has the good sense to mimic a classic but otherwise makes no sense at all.:::0:::1/4
I'm not sure who the target audience is for Legion - it's too talky for the action crowd, and anyone who knows the Bible will find it ridiculous:::0:::2/5
It's one of those movies you just want to hate, you just have to hate because deep down, you know it hates itself.:::0:::1/5
an incoherent flick positing, amid all the apocalyptic mayhem, that the Almighty is out of touch with His/Her inner Deity:::0:::1/5
[Has] at least a semi-awareness of the ridiculous hooey it's slinging ... a B-movie that's almost as much fun to laugh with as it is to laugh at. Note: I did say almost.:::1:::None
Legion may traffic in signposts of the apocalypse, but the whole affair mostly indicates that we're in the movie wasteland that is January.:::0:::1.5/5
I am dubious about the theological underpinnings of Legion. And I don't even believe in this crap. I generally like my fantasy to hang together in some sort of semblance of sense, however.:::0:::None
There are no orgies of planetary destruction; the action almost never leaves the diner, which may be just as well, since a short scene in heaven looks as if it were filmed on the set of a community college Shakespeare production.:::0:::1.5/5
Where many a movie falls into a vat of cheese is when it tries to show us "the other side." The angels' barracks turn out to look like the loft of an industrial-sized stable.:::0:::2/5
Parental Content Review:::0:::None
A cartoonishly grim supernatural thriller that could stand a lot less talk and a lot more thrills.:::0:::D-
A ridiculous piece of hokum that is far more fun than it has a right to be.:::1:::None
In the end, Legion is damned not by God but by dopey and long-winded dialogue, its inherent cheesiness, bland characters, and a very confused take on the Almighty.:::0:::2/5
Even if you overlook the lousy lighting, awkward editing, and uneven acting, therePosey, has structural problems and motivational issues in between the cliches. And Cena, a few movies into his career, is still all presence and no acting.:::0:::1.5/4
Talk about movies that cannot possibly live up to their titles.:::0:::None
An after-school special on steroids, Legendary is the story of a fake wrestler teaching his kid brother how to be a real wrestler.:::0:::1.5/4
A wonderfully crafted coming-of-age drama about the love that can heal the brokenness of an estranged family.:::1:::4/5
It's as if the filmmakers swallowed the sports-movie handbook and regurgitated every cliche in half-digested form.:::0:::1/5
[A] slow drip of high-fructose corn syrup.:::0:::None
Patricia Clarkson knocks an especially solid home-run as Sharon, a small-town mother of two polar-opposite sons.:::1:::B-
A down-home fable of familial healing that asks wrestling star John Cena to hold his weight opposite Patricia Clarkson.:::0:::1.5/4
John Cena radiates subdued menace and cool daring on screen. The problem is that he's intended as strictly dramatic wallpaper to this more suds than steroids coming of age wrestler story derivative of countless other sports tales.:::0:::None
...the good-hearted nature of the film and the solid cast helps to pull John Posey's stodgy screenplay up from the boot straps. The result is an entertaining Rocky style story in more ways than one.:::1:::C+
This schmaltz is better suited for TV's Hallmark Hall of Fame.:::1:::B-
Machete is enjoyable to a point, but the novelty soon wears off and there isn't enough inspiration to sustain the concept for a full-length feature film.:::0:::2/5
Though it starts off well, Machete becomes boring and slow towards the end as Trejo's shtick starts to feel a bit stale. Still, you'll definitely find some entertainment here.:::0:::6/10
First and foremost, this is a badass action film, with not only ever-badass Trejo doing ever-badass things, but everyone in the cast gets their badass moment.:::1:::3/4
Machete is the coolest revenge-driven, gore-splattered, star-studded Mexploitation flick ever!:::1:::4.5/5
Basically what we have here is a very silly exploitation film similar to what Rodriguez did with his half of "Grindhouse.":::1:::3/4
The end result is a disastrous waste of time that is as tedious as it is misguided...:::0:::1/4
... 105 minutes of ludicrous fun, but you can see the best parts in the trailer.:::1:::B-
At the end there's the humorous promise of sequels, but if Machete is a neat, bloody full-stop on the mainstream Mexploitation genre Rodriguez has done so much to resurrect, it's a fine one.:::1:::4/5
It may be thin but it's fun and for some that will be enough.:::1:::None
It's taken 15 years and umpteen billion supporting tough guy roles, but Robert Rodriguez has finally managed to make a major studio film starring Danny Trejo.:::1:::7/10
It's a big, messy, gloppy red bucket of fun, but it falls short of the impact of the Grindhouse punch by this much.:::1:::3/5
Yes it's a lot of fun and great to see such an illustrious cast get in on the act of making lowbrow cinema with a smile on their face, shame the cult element remains and only fans of the grindhouse genre will be fully engaged from start to finish.:::1:::6/10
Robert Rodriguez... brings his A game to the Z-grade, revelling in the cheesiness and over-the-top violence.:::1:::3/5
The lack of subtlety and discipline is what can make Machete a disreputable pleasure and less than a full success.:::0:::C+
Social commentary, you ask? Quite how can a film centrally preoccupied with Danny Trejo stabbing and shooting people and having sex with lots of women have any sort of pretension to political currency?:::1:::3/5
Starts out strong but things get a little wonky toward the finale. Sadly, the film is far too married to the faux trailer footage.:::1:::7/10
[Robert] Rodriguez's politics are right on the surface and about as complex as the film's revenge plot, a kind-of populist response to the anti-immigration rhetoric...:::1:::None
Turning all known manifestations of the classic western on their heads when not simply decapitating them in droves, Machete detonates the battle around immigration like no Tea Party rally ever could, in this get even bilingual guerrilla warfare satire.:::1:::None
While it's riotously entertaining, there's nothing much to it.:::1:::3.5/5
Un entretenimiento crudo, basico, con personajes de una sola pieza, algunos dialogos increibles y generosas dosis de sangre y desmembramientos. Un homenaje de Robert Rodriguez al cine clase B que tanto le gusta.:::0:::2/5
The film has some outrageously enjoyable set-pieces, but overall, the convoluted plot and Rodriguez' agenda spoil the fun.:::1:::3/5
Yet another missed opportunity from Rodriguez who relies on hammy performances from acting legends instead of adequately attempting to recreate the genre he claims to love.:::0:::2/5
[A] tongue-in-cheek, knife-in-guts action thriller...:::1:::None
This gleefully excessive pastiche of an exploitation picture delivers everything promised by its own faux trailer.:::1:::3/5
If your taste is for exploitation-style B-movies with an abundance of decapitations then director Robert Rodriquez's Machete is for you...:::1:::3/5
Machete is a supremely violent exploitation movie that's nowhere near as enjoyable as its trailer.:::0:::1/5
A loving homage to the B-movies that played in fleapit cinemas in the 70s, replete with oodles of violence, gore and gratuitous nudity.:::1:::4/5
Basically very silly and wastes the time of some talented celebrities (including Lindsay Lohan, as an addled nymphet). But it has its moments.:::1:::3/5
All set up and no punchline.:::0:::2/5
When the movie sticks to being a long-form version of the trailer, Machete delivers deadpan laughs and bloody, tongue-in-cheek action thrills.:::1:::3/5
The trouble with Rodriguez is that, while full of ideas, he sometimes struggles to balance quantity with quality. For all its manic action, Machete feels strained and oddly familiar.:::1:::3/5
If only Rodriguez had taken a machete into the edit, this would be the stuff of legend.:::1:::3/5
Inventive, assured and absurdly entertaining, Rodriguez's latest retro-exploitation movie is a gloriously gratuitous ride.:::1:::4/5
Disappointing, frequently boring and weirdly humourless thriller that fails to deliver on the promise of the trailer...:::0:::2/5
May prove that the mock trailers are better left alone as mock trailers...:::0:::None
full review at Movies for the Masses:::1:::3.5/5
Rodriguez - king of the stretch-a-budget, DIY mentality - is once again paying homage to all the B-grade schlock that inspired him, and having a hell of a lot of fun while he's at it.:::1:::4/5
Machite.:::0:::1/5
In true grindhouse form, Machete will win fans by wearing its action-filled lack of depth on its sleeve whilst still having its heart in the right place.:::1:::3/5
Machete has more brains than most movies out this year, even if a good portion of them are splattered across the pavement.:::1:::4.5/5
The selective charm of this badass brawn-fest might be lost on the non-action crowd after the initial novelty value subsides.:::0:::2.5/5
An irreverent and comically bloody tale of revenge and racism on the USA-Mexico border, brought to you by Robert Rodriguez as a parody of 1970's exploitation cinema.:::1:::3/5
A dreadful effort, a loud and self-satisfied movie that is brazenly short-sighted.:::0:::0.5/5
There is excess galore and plenty of gore as well, there's tongue in cheek, a completely original use of entrails but somewhere towards the end it just became a bit too silly for me.:::0:::None
Machete is essentially a fabulously fun cheap-thrill ride of fights, chases, muzzle flash, sexy ladies and over-acting designed to please the genre-loving generation of filmgoers unfortunate enough to have been born after the demise of the drive in.:::1:::3/5
The exposition-heavy dialogue and barrage of one-liners all fall terribly flat and what should be a fun romp feels more like a cinematic chore:::0:::None
While it's well made and Danny Trejo is an amazing presence on screen, the sustained over-the-top violence becomes tiresome.:::0:::None
A macho picture with a hero who is assailed by every conceivable hurdle and impending death many times, to give audiences a high octane, stunt-driven action thriller which takes no prisoners:::1:::None
The plot with its themes of revenge, honour and power might be a bit everywhere, but there is much to enjoy with this wild, theatrical joyride from Rodriguez, whose enthusiasm is infectious:::1:::None
It?s a pleasure to see Danny Trejo, the bad-ass character actor, take the lead in this homage to ?70s exploitation flicks, but co-director Robert Rodriguez doesn?t take exploitation all the way.:::1:::3/4
Machete don't text, but he will hack your limbs off.:::1:::2.5/4.0
Disreputable without being outright sleazy.:::1:::7/10
It's one joke, sure. But "Machete" is so delightfully ridiculous and over the top that it's actually highly enjoyable.:::1:::4/5
New film spoofs real-world failures of immigration policies:::1:::B+
Supremely self-aware and steeped in the aesthetics of vintage exploitation movies,Machete is a loving, blood-spattered homage to the gritty grindhouse action pictures of yesteryear.:::1:::None
It is hard to call this a good film. But it is tough not to have a good time (your taste and politics allowing).:::1:::6/10
Machete occupies the space of last year's violent comedy, Tropic Thunder, although not as funny.:::1:::7/10
"Warped, violent, dark, funny, sexy. Great stuff.":::1:::4/5
With an all star cast and creative writing Machete is the best film I have seen this year.:::1:::5/5
a bracing concretion of advocacy filmmaking and raucous hyperbole:::1:::4/5
The spirit of "Grindhouse" lives on.:::1:::3/5
What better way to attack a divisive and ridiculous culture clash in the real world than with a similarly ridiculous, testosterone-filled revenge fantasy?:::1:::2.5/4
Whether it's a beefy Steven Seagal or a topless Lindsay Lohan, viewers never quite know who or what Machete will throw at them next.:::1:::3/4
The trailer was better...:::0:::2.5/4
"Machete" Makes For Interesting Politics if Not For a Fully Satisfying Flick Due to Problematic Casting.:::1:::3/5
Alas, not even Lindsay Lohan -- doing a cartoonish riff on her tabloid persona (is this even possible?) -- can bring this rotten egg to a boil.:::0:::1.5/4
A surprisingly fun action-comedy mash-up... if you saw Grindhouse, it's more of the same here.:::1:::4/5
This violently refreshing entertainment functions as a rowdy political satire, sort of a Wag the Dog for fans of hot lengua tacos and cold Negra Modelo.:::1:::None
Rodriguez can't help being who he is, and that is something to smile about.:::1:::7/10
One of the best action movies in a long time.:::1:::B+
There's a lot of action but too much politics in this latest from Rodriguez:::0:::5/10
This "Mexploitation" action film packs a real action punch while mixing in a heavy dose of political satire. It is very entertaining if you enjoy it in the same spirit it was made.:::1:::B
The movie is ham-handed, repetitive, and rhythm-less -- a mess that's uglier than its hero and nowhere near as likable.:::0:::None
its mixing of the old and the new has an infectious vibe at times, but you can't help but wonder if Rodriguez will ever grow past his obsession with recreating the gutter past:::0:::2.5/4
Machete is a day laborer's wet dream that men and women of all immigration and employment status can enjoy together in peace, harmony and wanton blood lust. The only one who might ask for a refund is Shaft.:::1:::3/4
I have nothing against films that take political stances, but an exploitation flick? It's off-putting. I'd prefer to sit back and bask in the carnage and R-rated silliness.:::1:::2.5/4
Pretty damn fine Mexploitation.:::1:::4/5
The filmmaker, having spent his career making various iterations of the same nonsense, has lost his verve.:::0:::2/4
A salsa-covered middle finger to racist, anti-Latino factions, the audacious, outrageously fun Machete is pure Tex-Mexploitation with all the gunfire, gore, explosions and two-fisted action that can fit into one film.:::1:::4/5
Check out that cast of all-stars and never-were-stars and certainly-no-longer-stars. This must be what it's like when the Sheens and the Baldwins have a barbecue.:::1:::B
Robert De Niro, Lindsay Lohan and Steven Seagal all give equally stilted performances, and if you didn't know better you would think all three thespians were losers.:::0:::C
Campy, slice-and-dice, testosterone-fueled homage to violent '70s exploitation pictures - and I don't have to be a betting woman to suggest that men will like this R-rated guilty pleasure much more than women.:::1:::7/10
I had a good enough time.:::1:::6/10
For its first hour, Machete really gives hope that the concept, which started as a three minute trailer, could be sustained for an entire feature film.:::1:::56/100
(VIDEO) There were, what...seven, eight, nine decapitations and two naked women in the first five minutes of the movie? It's kind of hard to dislike a movie like that, but you HAVE to know what you're going to see.:::1:::7/10
(VIDEO) Machete doesn't need no stinking card to prove his citizenship, and neither does anyone else. You can taste the fury.:::1:::A
Don't get me wrong, there are moments, but Rodriguez found a way to make extreme violence boring.:::0:::5/10
Machete brings director Robert Rodriguez's career full circle and emerges as one of his very best films.:::1:::4/5
A fun B-movie. You're not likely to remember it a year from now, but sometimes lightweight entertainment is okay, especially when it's done with a wink, a smile, and a severed head.:::1:::3/4
Like last year's Black Dynamite, Machete deftly walks the border between self-aware parody and legitimate exploitation entry.:::1:::3.5/5
With 'Machete,' Robert Rodriguez demolishes subtlety with the same force that Rome unleashed on Carthage.:::1:::4/5
on the whole, Machete is a fun ride. But it's like me in a pair of skinny jeans... there's just a little too much in there to be comfortable.:::1:::3/5
One of the most outrageously entertaining, tongue-in-cheek guilty pleasures since Kill Bill---as long as you're willing to check your brain at the door from start to finish.:::1:::7.0/10
Funny and violent and propulsively scored, Machete is pure exploitation gold, more revival than satire, and it is tense, dirty fun from end to end:::1:::None
Needless to say, Machete would make for an excellent triple feature alongside Planet Terror and Death Proof.:::1:::4/5
For about an hour...the silliness works. Unfortunately, the last 45 minutes go south, as it were.:::0:::C+
Exuberantly and unrelentingly wrong.:::1:::None
Machete is almost completely devoid of any entertainment value. It's trying to be a spoof of low-budget action movies, except it keeps forgetting to poke fun and becomes that which it mocked.:::0:::1/4
You know a movie is going to be a blast when the credits say, "and introducing" in front the name of 1980s TV icon Don Johnson.:::1:::4.5/5
Rodriguez plans "Machete" sequels. Here's hoping the next is sharper and cuts closer to the bone.:::0:::None
The vehemence with which Machete articulates its morass of views makes the 'just kidding' claims very difficult to swallow.:::0:::F
All this, plus Cheech Marin as a gun-toting priest, Steven Seagal as a Mexican druglord and a rolling army of low-riders in the last act.:::1:::3.5/5
It's basically a one-joke exercise heading toward the inevitable big battle between vigilantes and Mexicans. There's lots of gore, flesh and fun along the way, but it gets repetitious.:::1:::B-
hack-and-slash nonsense:::0:::1.5/4
Machete is everything the Grindhouse movie wasn't. It doesn't posture. It doesn't pretend. It doesn't feel like idol worship.:::1:::8/10
There are film fans and there are film fetishists, and Robert Rodriguez might be the most hardcore film fetishist of all.:::1:::B+
After a while, even the most hopped-up moviegoers will find themselves looking at their watches and wondering if it is ever going to end.:::0:::3/5
If Machete suffers from anything, it's that it doesn't have ENOUGH action, blood and gore.:::0:::2.5/5
Worth seeing for fans of Rodriguez's brand of Tex-Mex splatstick. Just don't expect it to be anything more than what it is.:::1:::3/4
It's perfectly campy, but it doesn't go far enough often enough.:::1:::2.5/4
Casting surprises spice up this fully armed, gore splattered, amusing action explosion. It doesn't precisely capture the miracle of Grindhouse, but it's a fittingly head-chopping offshoot, smartly timed to feed on current immigration hysteria.:::1:::B+
Rodriguez should petition the Oscars to create an award for the greatest death scene. I was practically in tears trying to comprehend the awesome nature of this flick.:::1:::4/5
Sorry, mis amigos, wrong decades. The modern B-movie would seem to be devoted to self-conscious fun. More laughs, but fewer real chills.:::0:::2/4
The pace is swift, the tone playful, the screenplay peppered with one-liners.:::1:::3.5/5
Machete may not be all that original, but it is fresh -- fresh as a steel blade to the gut.:::1:::3.5/5
In patches, it is entertaining and ingenious. However, the director seems fatally uncertain whether he is making a full-blown action movie or a spoof.:::0:::2/5
It's a movie that just wants to have fun. To a large degree, it succeeds.:::1:::2.5/4
[It] may be a weird combo of speechy and pulpy but it's also what another all-star bloodbath, The Expendables, should have been -- self-aware, flashy and fun.:::1:::2.5/4
Machete makes no apologies for its absurdities or silliness, making it an over-the-top thrill ride.:::1:::3/4
Trejo's dignity gives the movie a soul, telling us that none of this stuff amuses Machete, who takes violence very, very seriously.:::1:::3/4
When you add in the ample violence...and the over the top action scenes, Machete makes its case as major escapist entertainment.:::1:::3.5/5
Brimming with infectious energy -- a well-made movie in the style of poorly made movies.:::1:::B+
Machete works because at no time does it ever ask the audience to take any of this too seriously, yet the nudges and winks are never so forceful that it feels like it's begging for your laughter.:::1:::7.2/10
The film is proof that even extremely over-the-top films can be monotonous in that their one tone is "ARGH!":::0:::2.5/5
Machete shouldn't be a movie - the idea itself defies Hollywood logic - but maybe that's the charm...Maybe there's a cult movie hiding within? Maybe with the right audience, the right drink, & the right friends Machete would be more exciting?:::1:::3.5/5
Machete's as bloody as you want it to be and just as violent as you'd expect.:::1:::B
Its evolution from a quick and to-the-point mockery to an overstuffed and tonally shifting feature has not served the material well.:::0:::2/4
While clearly not for all viewers, the first few minutes are quite entertaining for those who can stomach the material and appreciate what the filmmakers are trying to achieve. (Parental Review also Available):::1:::None
Unwilling to consistently push its violence, sex or comedy to the extremes demanded by its grindhouse roots, Machete turns out to be a mixed bag of monotonous exposition and tasteless fun.:::0:::5/10
Strong and mostly silent, Trejo brings to mind the late Charles Bronson, an underrated actor who made it big as an action star.:::1:::3/4
An orgy of hot babes, rugged men and blood-strewn weaponry, the picture has been made with giddy, people-pleasing aplomb.:::1:::2.5/4
Rodriguez combines sharp satire and timely political commentary with a decidedly B-movie ethos.:::1:::3/4
Perhaps most surprising is that Rodriguez has done for Robert DeNiro what his frequent collaborator Quentin Tarrantino has done for many far lesser stars...:::1:::B
Robert Rodriguez has expanded that two-minute dose of goofy Mexploitation thrills into a somewhat ungainly, but mostly fun 105 minutes.:::1:::None
Making a parody of bad movies that is itself not a bad movie is a delicate balancing act, and Rodriguez and Maniquiz get it right about half the time.:::1:::3/4
There's still a lot of fun to be had when he actually does pick up that signature blade and start chopping, but when it comes to Trejo taking the spotlight, we were hoping for more snarly, less sedate.:::1:::B-
A loud, giddy, carnal blast from one of cinema's most relentless schlock auteurs.:::1:::4/5
The whole thing is monumentally gruesome and just as monumentally cynical, a riot of grisly cliches designed to titillate and amuse.:::0:::1.5/4
Machete runs out of steam pretty early.:::0:::2/4
Rodriguez miscalculates his audience's desires at every turn, flogging the material thoroughly until it's as ugly and unpleasant as a movie can be.:::0:::1/5
Not only doesn't Machete have good taste, it has never *heard* of good taste.:::1:::B
There's a fine line between clever and stupid, as the Spinal Tap lads reminded us, and Machete grinds that line on a razor's edge.:::1:::2.5/4
Now we have a full-length Machete movie, and it turns out that, as usual, less is more.:::0:::2/5
It's absurd, absolutely insane and a lot of fun.:::1:::3.5/4
It's hard to think of another film this summer that offers such sheer anarchic fun.:::1:::3/4
"Machete" is gratuitously smutty, sadistically violent, politically aware and somehow also politically incorrect. Put more succinctly, it is awesome, and delivers every goofy gory guilty pleasure "The Expendables" was supposed to but did not.:::1:::4/5
The movie's an unexpected end-of-summer tonic: a trash guilty pleasure with a healthy (if really violent) sense of outrage. It's also Rodriguez's freest movie yet, and possibly his best.:::1:::3.5/4
Rodriguez's dullest, shallowest, and most self-satisfied film to date:::0:::2/5
With this cynical, self-conscious exercise in blood, guts and mayhem, Rodriguez goes back to his roots as a filmmaker in the early 1990s (El Mariacchi, Desperado), making a trashy, fast-moving cartoonish actioner.:::1:::C+
Robert Rodriguez's unofficial sequel to his half of Grindhouse is a lot like its predecessor--gory, funny and, in the end, somewhat disappointing.:::0:::None
It was Rodriguez's evident intention to make the most tasteless, weirdly cast, wildly irresponsible grindhouse movie of the year, and he's succeeded.:::1:::B-
It's often stylish and exciting, but the pile-up of cool kills, hot bodies, and other unprocessed bits of juvenilia doesn't add up to a good time.:::0:::C+
Rodriguez emphasizes style over substance, but the sheer audacity of his vision - the energy, the inventiveness, the extremes to which he's willing to take his gruesome sight gags - is his salvation.:::1:::3/4
Everyone in the film underestimates Machete, dismissing him as some mere Mexican day laborer just as Hollywood has underestimated Trejo, relegating him to supporting roles and villains. But in Machete, he's both the star and the hero.:::1:::None
This unholy mess replaces the artful ambition of The American with torture, blood spray, kinky sex, twisted fun and a bizarro critique of U.S. policy on illegal immigration.:::1:::2.5/4
Forget modulation, nuance or storytelling, this is a movie that hits hard from first to last, no questions asked or logic followed.:::1:::7.5/10
At this point, I can't tell if Robert Rodriguez ("Grindhouse," "Sin City"), co-directing with editor Ethan Maniquis, is spoofing grade-Z, 1970s-era, drive-in trash or if that is all he can make, outside of "Spy Kids" films.:::0:::D
Pro-illegal ideology won't win any fans at Fox News, but it's the only thing close to a point of view in an otherwise unfocused, overstuffed trip to the grindhouse.:::1:::3/5
For sheer entertainment value, Machete easily surpasses glossy action features like Takers and The Expendables.:::1:::None
Never fully justifies its expanded status nor does it feel like a movie that anyone's going to relish beyond one viewing, but far more satisfying and effective than The Expendables:::1:::6.5/10
At 105 minutes, Machete is at least half an hour too long for its own good.:::0:::2/4
When Machete yields a weed-whacker as a weapon, there is a subtle beauty to it.:::1:::3.5/5
If other movies feel increasingly emo, Machete is heavy metal. This manly feast eats The Expendables for breakfast.:::1:::3.5/5
It's disappointing that a film with this many decapitations and naked Lindsay Lohans can be so boring.:::0:::2/5
See Machete for Trejo, who barely cracks a smile, or even an emotion, but makes grade-Z stoic invincibility cool again.:::1:::B
Robert Rodriguez finally delivers on the promise of 2007's "Grindhouse" with this gleefully campy Mex-ploitation flick about a knife-wielding anti-hero doling out bloody slices of justice.:::1:::3/4
Trejo has one gnarled, weather-beaten mug, as if he had a staring contest with the sun - and won.:::1:::3/4
Machete's politics are a cringe-worthy mess but when it comes to over-the-top fun his blade is razor sharp.:::1:::3.5/5
You might be surprised by some of the more ingenious ways to deliver D.O.A.s - stiletto shoes, wine corkscrews, and of course an array of badass, beheading machetes that would make Jason Voorhees weep with envy.:::1:::None
If this kind of selfconscious cinema junk is to be enjoyed, it can only be enjoyed by morons.:::0:::None
It's a Hispanic American version of a blaxploitation film of the Super Fly school, with bloody action, titillating nudity and a catch-phrase riddled script.:::1:::2.5/4
Trejo brings both playfulness and gravitas to the archly juvenile proceedings, even as codirector-cowriter Rodriguez treats him like a cutaway sight gag...:::1:::3/5
[T]here's a refreshing nothing-sacred attitude to Machete, which is exactly the kind of eccentricity that this kind of movie demands, and gets exactly right...:::1:::None
The good news for fans: there isn't all that much downtime between the relentless action,'s so much talking -- and so little story -- that your mind is likely to wander.:::0:::2/5
The goofiest plundering of the Bible since Christopher Walkin's 'Prophecy' pictures...a combination of horror movie cliche and pseudo-religious mumbo-jumbo that proves a pretty fetid brew.:::0:::D-
While it's hard to give the movie a whole-hearted recommendation, Legion is better than it should have been due to Stewart's attempts to NOT make it into just another high concept video game existing merely to set up a franchise.:::1:::6.5/10
If you've seen it in the endlessly running ads, you've "seen it" in the film itself:::0:::1/5
Just a random cast playing caricatures of themselves, who are occasionally interrupted by half-baked otherworldly attacks. Movie over. Shrug.:::0:::1.5/5
Legion is USDA Prime Fail.:::0:::1/4
Director Scott Stewart, a former special-effects man, has not made a film for the ages, but he has made a decent piece of mindless entertainment.:::1:::B-
Alas, after a brisk start, the script turns out to be a rough and humorless beast slouching its way towards utter ludicrousness.:::0:::C-
God's given up on the human race and plans to wipe it out. Again.:::0:::1/4
A dramatically muddled but surprisingly involving Bible-themed fantasy thriller...:::1:::None
Bettany's presence keeps Legion from becoming just another zombie variant.:::1:::B-
Beneath its superficial religious facade, Legion is really just a run-of-the-mill zombie flick. A Biblical 'I Am Legend'.:::0:::2/5
Legion makes absolutely no sense and while the action scenes are cool, the dialogue bits in between are way too drawn out and boring. The ending is so unsatisfactory.:::0:::1.5/5
Whoever is responsible for the final cut must get the brunt of the blame. Sadly, a far better, more cohesive picture probably exists somewhere on the cutting room floor.:::0:::2/4
... just because I enjoyed [The Terminator] doesn't mean I want to sit through a witless dinner-theater retread of the movie featuring a cast that is capable of much better.:::0:::None
When all is said and done, Legion is all talk and no "do", a prude film with some seriously wasted potential. It's boring, slow-paced and takes itself way too goddamn seriously.:::0:::1/5
The finished product is shockingly bad ... an exercise in futility. Spare yourself the agony.:::0:::1.5/5
:::1:::3/5
a gross mis-use of CGI animals:::0:::2.5/5
full review at Movies for the Masses:::0:::1/5
Marmaduke sinks to Beverly Hills Chihuahua levels of awfulness and only reaffirms that talking animals aren't funny -- they're boring.:::0:::1/5
Spectacularly sentimental, full of ridiculous computer-animated action, and makes sure its animals are a good deal less pallid than the humans on view.:::0:::1/5
There is only so much fun you can have with a talking dog and Marmaduke quickly exhausts the possibilities.:::0:::None
Better than Cats & Dogs, but praise hardly comes much lower.:::0:::1/5
Fans of the single-panel cartoon that has run in newspapers since the 1950s will find plenty to disappoint them in this live-action adaptation.:::0:::1/5
The incoherent, moralising script demeans a number of actors, including William H. Macy, Judy Greer and David Walliams, reduced by a kindly editor to an ineffective cameo.:::0:::1/5
Dogs may be for life but the memory of this film will last about 20 seconds.:::0:::1/5
Oh dear.:::0:::1/5
Mirthless family romp that hits all the lowest comedy dominators.:::0:::2/5
Once upon a time, there was a promising young acting talent who went by the name of Owen Wilson.:::0:::1/5
Generally has its heart in the right place, there's some good slapstick and you have to admire the patience of filmmakers who are prepared to work with this many animals on one set.:::1:::3/5
Although comfortably under 90 minutes, Marmaduke is an epic chore to sit through.:::0:::1/5
With his eyes goggling and his gob smudging all over the place, he looks like a haunted painting.:::0:::1/5
Never veers from The Hollywood Guide To Mid-Budget Family Fare.:::0:::2/5
While not quite as bad as it could have been, this is very much Hollywood-schmaltz-by-numbers.:::0:::2/5
You could do worse with young kids, and they'll romp along with Marmaduke's throwaway adventures, it's just there's much better stuff out there that will entertain viewers above the age of 10 too.:::0:::2/5
It's as if Pixar never happened.:::0:::2/5
The novelty quickly fades since -- you guessed it -- the story's just not there.:::0:::2/5
It's dull and conventional, turning a half-century of mischief into 80 minutes of yawns.:::0:::None
[It] sounds like the makings of a totally rad John Hughes movie. Instead, it's an intermittently amusing parable about an outcast's ascension, as performed by a pack of digitally manipulated dogs. Next.:::0:::1.5/5
Marmaduke was never meant to star in his own movie; trying to strap a story to his back ends up a clunky and often lame affair.:::0:::None
'The conventionality and predictability of every scene, the lame puns, the absence of comic rhythm, the fart jokes butt-ending the film--all was sly metafilmic parody of the sheer banality and crassness of so much present-day film comedy, yes?' (Silence.):::0:::None
The movie works in a way that toddlers and early primary schoolers will definitely dig.:::1:::None
...a bottom-of-the-barrel family film...:::0:::1/4
It's not like the movie's target audience has fond memories of a newspaper comic strip. They probably don't even know that newspapers were things people used to read.:::0:::2.5/5
Previously, director Tom Dey made "Failure to Launch" and "Showtime," the latter of which was one of the worst movies of 2002. Congratulations Tom, you've done it again in 2010 with "Marmaduke.":::0:::F
Crammed with more recycled offal than a can of Alpo, Marmaduke exults in fart jokes, offensive stereotypes (the cat, voiced by George Lopez, laps guacamole), and sloppy storytelling. Bad, bad dog.:::0:::0/4
Well, here's another talking-animal movie, full of computer-generated imagery and body-function humor.:::0:::2/4
It's a talking-animal movie based on a one-joke, not-very-funny comic strip. That should be sufficient information for anyone old enough to read this review.:::0:::.5/5
Truly a milquetoast Scooby Snack for pet-friendly families who thrill to computer-generated mouth movements on real-life four-legged critters.:::0:::2/5
What's next: a Family Circus movie? Where o where is the hero who will save us?:::0:::None
Insipid and lumbering - with a title character perpetually emitting noxious gas fumes.:::0:::4/10
Will entertain the kids but it should have been a Disney Channel movie:::0:::4/10
I had a Scooby-Doo nightmare flashback.:::0:::None
This movie is one big dog.:::0:::None
Biting the neighbors' tires for 90 minutes seems like a far better use of time. Like an overpopulated puppy park on a Fourth of July weekend, this shaggy dog story stinks to high heaven.:::0:::2/10
A low-impact kid's comedy, "Marmaduke" may have little in common with the comic strip upon which it's based but remains a perfectly viable flick for dog-loving families.:::1:::B-
This threadbare film mostly feels like a way to keep out-of-school kids occupied during summertime.:::0:::None
Instead of spending $20 or more on tickets to Marmaduke, read the original strip for free at http://comics.com/marmaduke. In addition to the more agreeable price, it also has more laughs.:::0:::1/5
Insulting and vile... Marmaduke presumes that [children] are the most loathsome, stupid beings in the world.:::0:::1/10
The only revelation in this movie is that stilted dialogue doesn't sound any better coming out of a computer-animated dog's mouth than a human's.:::0:::1/4
Scripters Tim Rasmussen and Vince Di Meglio have cobbled together a plot from bits and pieces of other family-friendly pics.:::0:::None
This tale of a philosophical Great Dane who speaks with Owen Wilson's voice is not entirely without merit. Well, actually, it is, but never mind.:::0:::2/5
In a genre so choked with cynical films, this one was made with enough skill and heart to make its emotional payoffs believable and welcome.:::1:::3/4
Brad Anderson's long-running saga of the melty-looking Winslow family and the gangling, interfering Great Dane that should've been put to sleep ages ago gets a film treatment.:::0:::None
This is another opus to take that small, well-trodden step from the funny pages to the big screen. But we're in live-action territory here, meaning that real people actors compete for camera time with real dog actors.:::0:::2/4
Bland sitcom romp based on the long-running comic strip features wisecracking canines in a beach-set family story.:::0:::None
The dogs are cute -- I'll say that for it.:::1:::2/4
Kids deserve better. Heck, dogs deserve better.:::0:::D
Like most movies aimed at the kindergarten set, Marmaduke balances its giggly, gross-out gags with a stern moral agenda.:::0:::2/5
A bland, predictable blend of bad comedy and sentimentality.:::0:::1/5
It's a lot of twists and turns for very little reward. But bottom line, will the kids like it? Quite possibly.:::1:::3/5
For any adult, to watch Marmaduke is to stare into the gaping, digitally-enhanced maw of fluffy mediocrity for a ninety-minute stretch of valuable lifetime.:::0:::None
This is a film that begins and ends with a fart joke. And those are two of the highlights.:::0:::None
Somewhat amusing, but often cringe-worthy, cheesy, silly and, worst of all, fails to engage kids and adults simultaneously.:::0:::5.0/10
America's favorite Great Dane is more "O.C." than "Lassie.":::0:::2/5
Because nobody demanded it, here's a live-action version of the five-decade-old comic strip about an abnormally large Great Dane. Insert your own "dog days of summer" joke here.:::0:::None
Well, at least the dogs are cute.:::0:::C
If the phrase ''From the producer of Garfield'' doesn't scare you off, then step right up.:::0:::C-
There is only one word that can aptly describe this film --- painful!:::0:::None
These low-jinks wouldn't even make it on Letterman's Stupid Pet Tricks.:::0:::None
Lines like "Get your bark on," "Who let the dogs out?" and "Cowabarka" abound. Many of the jokes revolve around excretory functions.:::0:::1/4
It contains approximately twice the laughs of "Sex and the City 2" and half the number of bitches.:::0:::1/5
Remember when talking animals used to be funny?:::0:::0/4
I'm envisioning a sequel that joins together two towering franchises, only with an R rating for excessive gore: Marmaduke Versus Alvin and the Chipmunks, which, after all, is what that fake Machete trailer promised, and what the audience has come for.:::1:::None
Silly bloodbath without a soul. De Niro plays Senator Focker and Lohan is ridiculous. She needs an acting coach or a strong director.:::0:::None
Robert Rodriguez returns to the grindhouse with this entertainingly over-the-top, ultraviolent exploitationer.:::1:::None
If Rodriguez could think of it, he has included it in this film. He's a maestro of mayhem, throwing caution - and, occasionally, dramatic logic - to the wind.:::1:::None
Wildly uneven as it doggedly strives (sometimes with obvious strain) to sustain a free-wheeling, anything-goes air of exuberant junkiness.:::0:::None
How often can you see Cheech Marin nailed to a cross or Lindsay Lohan in a threesome with Trejo and the actress playing her mother?:::1:::3.5/5
Because there's no real character drama or consistent critique grounding the spoof, when Machete isn't laugh-out-loud funny, it's deadly boring.:::0:::None
Robert Rodriguez loves exploitation cinema but his homages to the disreputable genre are defined by italicized self-consciousness that leaves his humor without any room to breathe.:::0:::2/4
Extraordinary, astonishing, revealing, unique:::1:::None
Truly inspiring:::1:::None
The film is never flippant, never disrespectful and always approaches Mark's hobby with eyes wide open and no agenda other than fascinated admiration.:::1:::5/5
Alternate realities help us work through issues, but might keep us from confronting the world:::1:::None
By allowing his emerging post-trauma experience into his pretend kingdom, the man is reconstituting his self-consciousness, reclaiming the dignity of his whole mind, recovering his soul.:::1:::82/100
First-time director Jeff Malmberg does almost everything right in this stunningly empathetic documentary.:::1:::A-
Marwencol provides a deeply empathetic view of loneliness and powerful evidence of art as an outlet.:::1:::A
Speaks to the addictiveness, the catharsis, the unpredictability, and the eternity of the creative process.:::1:::9/10
A heartwrenching tale of wish fulfillment on a nearly molecular level...:::1:::4/5
Marwencol is a mesmerizing documentary, and like Mark Hogancamp it continually surprises you. It may also be one of the best films you'll see all year.:::1:::10/10
Hogancamp didn't know he was creating art ... he was merely surviving, spinning stories for his sanity. In an era of 'look-at-me,' this type of agenda is as far away from our world as Marwencol itself.:::1:::8/10
Cinematically raw, untidy and sometimes positively odd, but it's also revealing, fascinating, unsettling and ultimately quite touching.:::1:::B+
"Marwencol" is inspiring but also insightful because it refuses to gloss over complex, even discomfiting questions surrounding its endearing but troubled central character.:::1:::A-
Malmberg instead takes a gentle approach. He's patient and coaxing, and he lets Mark grow comfortable for the camera.:::1:::3.5/4
Simultaneously hypnotic and unnerving, it asks some rather uncomfortable questions about the nature of art and the potential and limits of self-healing.:::1:::3/4
Director Jeff Malmberg sees something in Hogancamp that he wants all of us to see, an imperfect human scarred by horrific trauma who nonetheless finds a reason to live.:::1:::3/4
Enthralling and deeply strange.:::1:::4/5
The film Marwencol is as mesmerizing as Mark's imaginary town and treats him and his world with absolute respect:::1:::9/10
Hogancamp's alliance with director Jeff Malmberg in this artful and poignant film marks a victory in the war against the self.:::1:::3.5/4
A painfully intimate, mysterious, joyous film.:::1:::4.5/5
Director Jeff Malmberg documents Hogancamp's twin worlds with care and restraint; "Marwencol" is an example of how a documentary filmmaker can delve into the life of an eccentric person without exploiting them:::1:::3.5/4
A fine, delicately nuanced portrait of an artist compelled by mysterious forces to create something utterly unique.:::1:::3/4
Mark, who is on camera much of the time, comes across as an amiable burn-out case, primitivist, artist, obsessive childman, battered soul, horny guy, charming, weird and, by the way, a collector and wearer of women's high heels.:::1:::A-
If you have even a passing interest in outsider art, you owe it to yourself to see "Marwencol.":::1:::3/4
The beauty of "Marwencol" is that, by the time it's over, wanting to live in a doll village doesn't sound so weird because we understand exactly where Hogancamp is coming from.:::1:::3.5/4
Producer/director Jeff Malmberg tells the amazing true story with tenderness and tact.:::1:::4/4
This is truly inspirational filmmaking.:::1:::A-
May be aesthetically rough around the edges but it nonetheless offers an empathetic view on a stunningly unique figure.:::1:::B
...either an amazing example of self therapy through art or the most elaborate ploy to get laid ever. Then it gets really weird.:::1:::A-
Marwencol is about Hogancamp and his miniature alter-ego, about his photographs and his creative process. But it is also, on a deeper level, about how we process our experiences...:::1:::3.5/4
What makes this documentary film interesting is the unique world Hogancamp creates to cope wit anyone?:::0:::2/4
Its only redeeming values are an insane dog-surfing competition that feels like a weird dream you may have once had, and a mangy street mongrel whose slobbery lips give perhaps the finest Sam Elliott performance ever. The rest is pure kibble.:::0:::1.5/5
If Hollywood insists on cranking out movies about dogs that won't stop yapping at us, I hope they'll all be as well-made as Marmaduke.:::1:::2.5/4
No, the farting, peeing and dancing dogs don't add anything -- at least on the positive side -- to the proceedings that mercifully clock in at less than 90 minutes. (Parental Review also Available):::0:::None
How bad is Marmaduke? Let's put it this way: Garfield, come home - all is forgiven.:::0:::1/5
Basically a Saved By the Bell episode performed by talking animals.:::0:::1.5/5
Is there really a reason to insult the intelligence of children so?:::0:::1/4
The first of many instances of doggy-doo humor comes about three minutes into the film.:::0:::C
A pathetic waste of time and money for all concerned, the movie pushes one's patience to the brink.:::0:::.5/4
There is a special place in hell for filmmakers who deliberately force audiences to endure a worse dog movie than both Marley & Me and The Shaggy Dog remake put together.:::0:::2.5/10
one long cringe-fest that starts out abysmally and gets worse with horrifying determination.:::0:::0/5
It's kind of fun. For about five minutes.:::0:::2.5/5
In terms of his longevity in the newspapers, 'Marmaduke' is a very old dog. And the movie has no new tricks up its paws.:::0:::C-

Marmaduke is a dog of a film that deserves to be put down.:::0:::0.5/4
Marmaduke the movie is exactly the kind of mind-numbing kiddie trash that parents dread taking their kids to.:::0:::1/4
Even by talking-critter comedy standards, Marmaduke lacks mirth and imagination.:::0:::1.5/4
As talking-dog movies go, Marmaduke makes Beverly Hills Chihuahua look like Up.:::0:::2/4
Too bad Marmaduke wasn't released a few years ago, when forced viewings of it might have been offered as a suitable punishment for Michael Vick.:::0:::D
It's no Babe, but it's no bomb either.:::1:::3.5/5
When one of the last sounds you hear in a work of family entertainment is a Great Dane passing gas, there's only one conclusion to be drawn. The movie hates your family.:::0:::0.5/4
Will future film historians, looking back, consider these CGI animal comedies to be the true horror movies of the 2000s?:::0:::1/4
You have to wonder what it was that got the talented Macy onboard, aside from a paycheck.:::0:::1.5/4
Kids love dogs and fart jokes. The goods are being delivered to the target audience. All others should look away.:::0:::D
A sprightly family comedy about a frisky Great Dane and his human companion who both learn new things during a major transition in their lives.:::1:::3/5
The unenviable task of adapting a famously mediocre newspaper comic is one the filmmakers meet with noticeable strain.:::0:::5/10
The flea-bitten screenplay seems to have been plucked from the wastebasket of recycled ideas and rewritten by someone whose third language was English -- after Danish and Dog.:::0:::1/4
Staple of newspapers since 1954, leaving the producers over 50 years of canine antics to help build a screenplay. So, naturally, they invent a series of urine and fart jokes to best service the enduring legacy of the rascally Great Dane.:::0:::C-
The moment I saw Marmaduke's big drooling lips moving, I knew I was in trouble.:::0:::2/4

[Megamind] has splendid visuals, a good story, and enough witty dialogue to turn it into an enjoyable experience that's worth checking out.:::1:::3/4
It may not raise the bar of this rapidly developing genre, but it manages to pack a lot of fun and spectacle into its running time.:::1:::3/5
It does have the odd cheeky nod for the grown-ups -- and it is presented in inglorious 3D -- but it's also got a screenplay overflowing with charm, intelligence, wit and a real spark.:::1:::4/5
Would be lost in the crowd, perhaps deservedly so, if it didn't pull aces on its execution.:::1:::7/10
If you have to choose between this and the superficially similar Despicable Me, choose Megamind. It's less predictable, funnier, cleverer and generally more enjoyable.:::1:::4/5
This is a harmless animated movie that's full of empty laughs. The main problem with all those empty laughs is that they arrive wrapped in a package you've seen before, probably even if you're still a kid.:::0:::2.5/5
Hardly a knockout, but Megamind is an immensely enjoyable animated adventure that spoofs and pays homage to the superhero genre.:::1:::7/10
There's a distinctly deflated ambiance to the shenanigans, leaving the picture serious eye-candy on the prowl for bellylaughs it infuriatingly never finds.:::0:::C
Megamind is dramatically and comedically inert.:::0:::C
...often shrewd, colorful, witty, and well animated, I found it oddly flat, too.:::1:::6/10
Straying from a predictable, easily defined structure, Megamind instead serves up consistent surprises, challenging audience expectations and engaging the mind as well as tickling the funny bone.:::1:::4/5
Falling short of a mind-blowing experience, Megamind is still fine family entertainment that doesn't require deep thinking.:::1:::3/5
Its story's third-act inversions still provide a pointed rebuke to superhero narratives' set-in-stone dynamics.:::1:::B
What it lacks in originality, this wickedly funny take on a superhero villain makes up for in a multi-layered plot, terrific voicing and well balanced energy.:::1:::B+
full review at Movies for the Masses:::1:::3/5
What is a villain if not someone who has been pushed too far in life and has started to push back? And with nothing to push against, what do they become?:::1:::4/5
A well-plotted, genuinely fun spin on the Superhero/Supervillian genre with talented voice talent put to good use rather than simply stunt-cast:::1:::4/5
'Megamind' may not be thought-provoking, but it is fun. And, come to think of it, it does give us something to ponder along the nature-or-nurture concepts of destiny.:::1:::3/4
A snappy script and superior voice work make this animated action-comedy much more fun than expected:::1:::4/5
It's a sassy comedy with a lot of one-liners, some of which apparently came from improvisation between Ferrell and Fey, both in good vocal form. The quality of animation is outstanding, as you would expect.:::1:::3.5/5
Megamind is more like a comedy for adults that children will feel comfortable tagging along to.:::1:::None
A moderately amusing experience... will play better to a younger, less discerning crowd.:::1:::3/5
In its attempt to spoof the superhero genre, Megamind just may be too smart for its own good.:::0:::2.5/5
Is Megamind just a vehicle for Will Ferrell to use funny voices and shout a lot?:::0:::C+
The movie around Ferrell's performance isn't nearly as good as he is.:::0:::3/5
A full-bodied, busy-as-heck, funny-as-heck comedy adventure from Dreamworks that merrily riffs -- in its own fractured way -- on the Superman legend.:::1:::3.5/5
If you understand what it's trying to do, you will like it a good deal better than if you don't.:::1:::3/5
It's never quite slap-your-knees hilarious, but Megamind will still have you smiling from dimple to dimple for every one of its 95 minutes.:::1:::4/5
It's just a shame the filmmakers didn't have any tricks up their sleeve to enliven a rather rote superhero movie experience.:::0:::None
The action is big and mostly spectacular, the performances are all spot-on (even Hill, who once again plays himself, is well cast), and most importantly Megamind himself is actually kind of likable.:::1:::None
Despite the terrific voice cast and eye-catching animation, this seems disappointingly formulaic and fails to offer real laughs.:::0:::None
These days the bad guys have all the fun.:::1:::4/5
There's are some decent laughs to be had, mainly courtesy of a feisty, pneumatically animated Lois Lane-esque reporter, voiced by Tina Fey, who remains thoroughly unimpressed with superpowers of any stripe.:::1:::3/5
Ferrell's voicework is spot on, Pitt gamely sends up his squeaky clean image and Fey is a joy as the conflicted heroine.:::1:::4/5
The film appropriates elements from Shrek and The Incredibles and produces an entertaining hybrid that should have parents chuckling with glee.:::1:::None
The plot is wildly shaken as it does U-turns and some sleight of hand, but director Tom McGrath has a feather-light touch as inventive ideas play out with humour and appeal:::1:::None
Every potential for real emotion is squandered. It feels like a superhero film made by people who don't believe in or care about superheroes.:::0:::2/5
Good stuff, up to a point, but nothing like the passion and brilliance of The Incredibles or Toy Story.:::1:::3/5
'You're so predictable,' Roxanne tells Megamind early in the movie, and I'm afraid it's fair criticism.:::1:::3/5
Though clearly derivative and with a good dash of The Incredibles, Megamind is breezily directed by Madagascar's Tom McGrath and there's plenty of fun lines, too.:::1:::4/5
Eyeball-opening 3D digimation with eyelid-closing plot.:::0:::2/5
A fun ride but just that.:::1:::3/5
It's terrific fun from start to finish, even if it doesn't quite match the good-versus-evil japes of The Incredibles or Despicable Me.:::1:::4/5
Gleefully subverting the standard good vs evil hokum, while delivering an eye-popping adventure with characters you can really root for, Megamind is simply super.:::1:::4/5
A retro-stylised fantasy-satire that balances knowingness with affection, winning kids and olds over in the process. Wry, spry and very funny.:::1:::4/5
For a film whose stock in trade are tongue-in-cheek reversals of comic-book cliche, it too often settles for trite audience-pleasing.:::1:::3/5
Hugely enjoyable, brilliantly funny comedy with superb animation, terrific vocal performances and a witty script that's packed with great gags and a multitude of fan-pleasing superhero references.:::1:::4/5
The resulting product is a serviceable parable about 'being good' that is aimed low enough to at least connect with the kids in the audience. A shame then that the film's sense of humour occasionally slips into groan-worthy territory.:::1:::3/5
Coming in the wake of The Incredibles and Despicable Me, the film might, like its villainous protagonist, be something of an also-ran - but when it comes to generating super laughs, Megamind is a winner.:::1:::3.5/5
Should get the whole family laughing, albeit for different reasons.:::1:::4/5
It's one of those films that when you get done watching it, you go, 'Oh, that was cute.':::1:::3/5
Full of fun and eye-popping images, "Megamind" is what they used to call in the old days of television "side-splittingly funny.":::1:::3.5/4
... DreamWorks Animation is carving itself out a niche for consistent high-concept zaniness.:::1:::3.0/4.0
The fast-paced wisecracks and ironic asides that are the studio's hallmark help to push the film past the lumpy, generic storytelling.:::1:::None
while its hectic battle sequences and penchant for mass destruction will certainly keep the eyes of action junkies satiated, its sly depictions of the balance between good and evil actually provide quite a bit of food for thought:::1:::3/4
I am usually against 3D films but Dreamworks has found the right formula with Megamind and How To Train Your Dragon. Will Ferrell is back!:::1:::4/5
Megamind is perfectly fine for the kids, but adults might find their own megaminds wandering at various points throughout a film that doesn't compare to The Incredibles when it comes to affectionately tweaking the superhero genre.:::0:::2.5/4
Rollickingly funny superhero comedy of manners about a poor, misunderstood supervillain may not be The Incredibles, but it's still incredible.:::1:::None
Even if it's not great, Megamind manages to be diverting.:::1:::2.5/4
A lively cast and an interesting flip on the superhero concept make 'Megamind" a fun time at the movies for viewers of all ages.:::1:::None
It's not bad -- simply unremarkable.:::0:::3/5
...the result is something with which to pass the time, not one to savor and look forward to repeat viewings.:::1:::3/5
Compared to other animated features presented this past year "Megamind" is only slightly above average entertainment. We have come to expect great entertainment.:::1:::6/10
Oh DreamWorks, we know you can achieve greatness; why do you so eagerly refuse to do so?:::0:::5/10
An unfortunate regression back to short-term pop-culture disposability ... At the screening I attended, the sounds of kids fidgeting almost drowned out the extended Marlon Brando imitation.:::0:::None
Like Kraft Mac & Cheese or your favorite old sweats with the Duct Tape waistband, familiarity can be comforting. Megamind doesn't break any new ground other than being the rare family flick that the whole family can enjoy.:::1:::3/4
The lively cast and interesting flip on the superhero concept make it a fun time at the movies for all ages.:::1:::4/5
Anyone under 10 will probably be bored and confused. For others, though, great fun ...:::1:::4/5
It isn't original, but it is funny, the story is cleverly constructed and the artwork is first-rate.:::1:::B
A slightly manic but dependably enjoyable animated effort, poised between familiarity and freshness, that scores based on its voluminous joke output and a winning vocal performance by Will Ferrell.:::1:::4/5
It's borrowed and blue. The homage to 'Superman' gets old and the film is only slightly better (and very similar to) 'Despicable Me.' Anything original tends to fall flat.:::0:::5/10
A tale of existential angst suitable for children:::1:::4/5
What begins as one witty, unstoppable blast eventually succumbs to a flat story elevated by its consistently terrific animation.:::0:::C+
Megamind is fast and funny, with excellent use of 3D.:::1:::3.5/4
You know a movie's scraping for laughs when it includes "Bad to the Bone," "Highway to Hell" and Michael Jackson's "Bad" as themes for its villain.:::1:::B-
Three dimensions or two, the one-dimensional plot has little appeal.:::0:::3/5
In this refreshing twist on a familiar format, director Tom McGrath combines flawless 3-D animation with a bevy of comedic talent to craft an entertaining adventure with plenty of smart, grown-up laughs.:::1:::3/4
Every animation studio has its strong suit, but none embraces formula with the zest of DreamWorks.:::0:::C+
If celebrity voices and an excess of licensed pop music are your thing, you might forgive the lack of ambition here.:::0:::2.5/4
A complex story with very sophisticated forward momentum... It's about what makes people a hero or villain,and the answer is not just simply one is bullied and the other is revered.:::1:::None
Family audiences finally have something worth turning out in droves to see. This 96-minute movie proceeds at a zippy pace and the audience's attention never wavers from the excitement up on the screen.:::1:::3/4
Doesn't have that memorable a story and isn't as visually creative as it should be but you can't find actors much better at this kind of material than Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, and David Cross.:::1:::3/5
What it lacks in inventiveness, 'Megamind' makes up in wit, intelligence, and customarily gorgeous animation.:::1:::4/5
Megamind isn't necessarily a bad movie - it just doesn't do much to distinguish itself from the rest of the pack.:::0:::2.5/5
Not only has Megamind showed up late for the box office battle with Despicable Me, but it has also brought a knife to an atomic death ray fight.:::0:::3/5
Superhero films are sufficiently prevalent these days to merit an additional pasting or two. Megamind keeps such satire a welcome visitor rather than a tiresome bore.:::1:::B
The promise of extraordinary brain power isn't fulfilled.:::0:::2.5/4
No doubt some of it is charming enough to induce giggles in its preteen target audience... What's needed is a narrative invention to match the technical invention.:::1:::B-
You'll enjoy it. And then you'll forget it.:::1:::B-
The story's the thing. And this one is as subtly deep as it is ridiculously fun.:::1:::3.5/4
I do love Ferrell, whose absurdist man-child routine has always been a matter of taste.:::1:::3/4
Kinetic, clever and even emotionally satisfying.:::1:::3.5/5
The kiddie set can chortle at Megamind's slapstick and its goofy one-upmanship while adults get a kick out of all the smart spatial tricks that highlight the 3-D effects.:::1:::7/10
Megamind is a blast. Take your kids. Stay with them. There are plenty of laughs for everyone. Bring your asprin for the 3D headache.:::1:::None
Clever animated superhero story is fun, not too scary.:::1:::3/5
A smart send-up of the Superman myth and the age-old precept of good vs. evil.:::1:::4/5
It's all borrowed: the characters, the plot, the predictable "bad" tunes. Even Megamind's ensembles look to have been raided from Maleficent's closet. Not so Mega, but rather, Mild.:::0:::4/10
With some cool superhero action, Megamind is mildly amusing for the most part, but it feels like it could have been much better.:::1:::3/5
Kids of all ages will understand and appreciate this film's meaning without feeling beaten over the head.:::1:::None
But the kids will love it.:::0:::None
"Megamind" is a lot of fun -- a movie that youngsters will enjoy for its cartoonish slapstick and visuals and that adults can appreciate for its sly humor.:::1:::3.5/4
Isn't exactly groundbreaking, but it's good, clean fun.:::1:::B
Complain loudly about the 3D tide - but see and enjoy Megamind for its own considerable charms.:::1:::None
This 3-D, animated adventure leaps -- in a single bound -- into familiar comic-book/superhero territory but soars on the strength of zippy running gags and high-flying visuals.:::1:::B+
Small children are likely to be disappointed by the paucity of silly slapstick or bathroom gags, while their older siblings will probably fidget at the lack of scares.:::0:::2.5/4
You'll probably laugh, and you'll probably wish it were better.:::0:::2.5/4
This animated feature is what Yogi Berra called "deja vu all over again," its shopworn premise most recently having served the marginally better "Despicable Me" this summer.:::0:::2/4
It has plenty of details for us to sink our teeth into, without forgetting to make the audience laugh.:::1:::3.5/4
"Megamind" is a smart, funny and original treat. Sweet enough to deliver a message about creating your own destiny, but with just enough sour grapes not to cloy, the movie delivers pure pleasure from start to finish.:::1:::3.5/4
A witty 3-D animated deconstruction of superhero movies.:::1:::3/5
It's well worth checking out in theaters despite the fact that ads reveal a few spoilers and the finale is a tad familiar.:::1:::8/10
As winning as Ferrell and Cross are, they're still trapped in a formula storyline that follows some very familiar beats.:::0:::2/5
The plot is rich, the execution poor.:::0:::2/4
Divertingly splashy and mildly amusing but not very memorable.:::1:::7/10
It's a harmless, inoffensive, moderately likable throwaway of a cartoon that you will probably start forgetting as soon as it's over.:::1:::B-
"Megamind" is a resounding flop.:::0:::C-
Megamind is good at keeping the audience busy, but only after the credits roll do you realize that most of it was just noise.:::1:::3/5
In a sort of backhanded answer to Pixar's The Incredibles (and I mean that in a positive way), DreamWorks hits yet another animated adventure out of the park. Megamind is clever, fast-paced and fun, and looks fantastic in 3D.:::1:::7/10
one of the year's better animated films which offers a surprisingly engrossing nature-versus-nurture question about mythic origin stories: are heroes born, or are they made?:::1:::None
May be worth seeing, but interested viewers would do well to either find a theater showing it in two dimensions or just wait for the inevitably superior Blu-Ray release.:::1:::2.5/4
Hilarious, refreshingly smart, thrilling and heartfelt. It will delightfully entertain everyone, young or old, good or evil.:::1:::9.1421/10
What this raucous 3D animated fun house lacks in originality (think bastard child of The Incredibles and Despicable Me) it makes up for in visual and vocal wit.:::1:::2.5/4
Not exactly ingenious, but certainly an entertaining way to spend an afternoon at the theater with the family.:::1:::2.5/4
...an OK entertainment that's instantly forgettable.:::0:::C+
[A] smarter, sharper, funnier, wiser story than I ever could have expected... [I]t reinforces what we love about superheroes and why we embrace them... And yes, still, Megamind really is all about the villain.:::1:::None
...will appeal to little kids with its bright colors and animation, older kids will like the story and most adults will be entertained.:::1:::B-
Even the 3-D thing, which makes films murky and claustrophobic, is a gimmick from the 1950s. And wasn't this rehabilitated-bad-guy routine the plot of "Despicable Me"?:::1:::B+
Very relatable for elementary school kids while giving them something to stretch for with Tesla coils and existential discussions and a plot with a couple of extra twists.:::1:::B+
Mostly, the jokes and the recurrent attempts to tweak the superhero genre serve as a reminder that somebody else has already done it better.:::0:::None
Ferrell, Fey and Hill acquit themselves hilariously, and Cross steals the movie as Minion.:::1:::4.5/5
If it's difficult to find novelty in Megamind, it's also hard not to like.:::1:::2.5/4
Middle-School boys are the target audience for the shifting personalities, robot minions and building-smashings. People above that age will mostly just endure it all...:::0:::2/5
Megamind has some funny moments, silly mispronunciations and comical socio-political references. But it suffers from being the second animated movie this year to feature a dastardly villain for a hero.:::0:::2/4
More impressive than the multi-dimensions is "Megamind's" minimalist, modernist look. It creates a crispness that feels more contemporary than retro, which not only is very aesthetically pleasing but makes it easier to savor the film's many sight gags.:::1:::3.5/5
"Megamind" is a genial animated sendup of superhero flicks that should appeal to kids around the age when they're getting a bit cynical about do-gooders in capes and tights.:::1:::3/4
The bonus in "Megamind" is a thoughtful and heartfelt look at the thin line between good and evil and hero and villain, how they can exist in equal parts in many of us, and how their appearances can be deceiving.:::1:::3/4
One of those movies that disappears too quickly, leaving memories of better ones in its wake.:::0:::2.5/4
This is a great-looking (and sounding) toon, one definitely worth seeing in 3D, but it's ultimately the story, characters and humor that makes Megamind such a pleasant surprise.:::1:::3 1/2 stars
Megamind is full of good ideas. But they never coalesce into a satisfying whole.:::0:::2/4
[A] handsome and generally amusing adventure.:::1:::None
Megamind has momentum and dazzle.:::1:::3/4
What Megamind lacks in apparent laughter it makes up for in sheer cleverness.:::1:::4/5
Megamind is well-versed in superhero routine without turning blase. The boredom of formulas and roles and expectations is very much its point.:::1:::3/4
... 'Well, that was fun. A lot better than I expected.' An assessment with which this reviewer can concur.:::1:::3/5
simultaneously more and less surprising than one would imagine:::1:::4/5
It's densely populated with gags, it's a nice piece of art, and well-made 3-D, if you feel like paying the premium.:::1:::C+
There's nothing wrong with animation aimed at adults, but this may be the first kids' movie that throws fewer bones to its supposed intended viewers than to their parents.:::1:::B+
While it is never anything less than vibrant and exceedingly clever, it is also a rather slight thing fh his intense feelings of anger and loss over his near-fatal beating by five men.:::1:::B

Outsider art has never seemed as riveting -- or as revealing -- as it does in Marwencol.:::1:::4/5
Marwencol is truly a wonderful town. Because Mark Hogancamp puts incredible detail into the appearance of each doll, everything seems so real!:::1:::None
In the end, Marwencol is a fascinating portrait of a reinvented mind, rather than one of those all-American tales of triumph over adversity.:::1:::None
This tender documentary considers the mysteries of both art and coping.:::1:::A-

First-time director Jeff Malmberg tells Hogancamp's fascinating story with sensitivity, never resorting to exploitation.:::1:::3/4
Jeff Malmberg's documentary does an amazing job of turning this small patch of dollhouses into a vibrant world of its own, utilizing Hogancamp's own extraordinary pictures of Marwencol's inhabitants to great effect.:::1:::3/5
This is outsider art in its finest, most unsettling expression.:::1:::None
Malmberg uses his imagination as well in telling this story, with its resonating nuances about the meaning of art and identity, but Hogancamp's modest genius and his incredible creation transcend the confines of outsider art.:::1:::None
A must-see.:::1:::4/4
An astounding movie one of those tales of all-American oddness that just keeps flowering into weirder, richer territory.:::1:::None
About as fascinating as a documentary can get.:::1:::None
Malmberg applies stylistic and structural tricks to create the most compelling portrait possible, reflecting a respectful but very different agenda from that of his subject.:::1:::None
Where the film is strongest is its ability to lure you in with the astonishing artistic quality and craftsmanship of Hogancamps creation, then make it clear that the man himselfnot his workis the real accomplishment.:::1:::A-
Exactly the sort of mysterious and almost holy experience you hope to get from documentaries and rarely do, Jeff Malmbergs Marwencol is something like a homegrown slice of Herzog oddness, complete with true-crime backfill and juicy metafictive upshot.:::1:::None
This one's a keeper.:::1:::None
Malmberg's video imagery, captured by point-and-shoot camerawork, and livened up with big band music from time to time, can't hold a candle to outsider artist Mark Hogancamp's work.:::0:::2/4

A good old-fashioned bad action movie; the type the eighties used to churn out on a regular basis.:::1:::3/5
[The filmmakers] should go back and revisit the original film to discover what made it good in the first place.:::0:::2/4
This is Predator karaoke - a film which looks and sounds like the 1987 film, but lacks the zest.:::0:::None
It has no real new thoughts in its head but it updates all the old thoughts into a slimy new package just fine.:::1:::4/5
The real enemy is too much exposition.:::0:::C
It's nothing to shout from the rooftops about but, given the standard set by the majority of Predator movies, you're unlikely to be disappointed...:::1:::3/5
Despite pacing problems, Predators is a wildly entertaining picture that bends the franchise back to more captivating quandaries, erasing much of the bad taste left behind by previous installments.:::1:::B
There's something to be said about a movie with a Predator in it that is actually decent, especially after three previous tries in 20-plus years.:::1:::6/10
Forget Predator 2 and all that Alien Vs Predator rubbish - this is the sequel that the Arnie-starring '80s actioner deserved.:::1:::3/5
Predators lovingly embraces its B-movie roots, but drags along the cinematic trappings, too.:::1:::7/10
I couldn't get past Brody as an action hero, and I didn't jump from my seat once. I wanted at least that much from a film that spent so much money on bullets and bazookas and bombs and bombast.:::0:::6/10

If Predators had plunged deeper into the bloodsport-honour-hunting, kill-or-be-killed psyche of both sides, this could've been a truly jolting reboot.:::0:::None
This film deserves more praise than I ever expected to lavish on a "Predator" movie.:::1:::None
After two poor Alien vs. Predator showings, Predators returns to the tried, true, and successful formula off setting 'em up and knocking 'em down.:::1:::3.0/4.0
If you don't know the original 1987 classic Predator line-for-line and inside-out, you will probably miss half the gags in this one.:::1:::2.5/5
Funciona surpreendentemente bem ao descartar qualquer tentativa de se estabelecer como uma ficcao cientifica seria e ao investir, em vez disso, na acao quase continua.:::1:::3/5
Nimbly directed by Nimrod Antal, this is something of a throwback to 1980s action-exploitation: The emphasis is on special makeup effects and brawny physicality rather than computer-generated imagery.:::1:::3/4
Most sequels are inferior to the original film, but "Predators" is an exception, a film that stands on its own and is the equal of the original film.:::1:::B
'What planet is this?' asked Adrien. 'Wherever it is, my iPhone 4 keeps dropping calls,' said Danny Trejo.:::0:::D

The movie never manages to come up with an ending, but why bother? There's going to be a sequel anyway.:::1:::3/5
As soon as the movie starts, with Royce falling from the sky, 'Predators' is declaring you're going to have a fast, fun time. And for the most part, this movie totally delivers.:::1:::8/10
If the nicest thing you can say about Predators is that it's the best sequel that Predator has ever had, well: that's just not a very high bar to clear, now is it?:::1:::6/10
A cross between The Most Dangerous Game and The Twilight Zone with a touch of Cube... 'Predators vs. Humans,' anyone?:::0:::None
Nimrod Antal has crafted an insanely action-packed science fiction flick while simultaneously paying homage to the original material and creating his own.:::1:::4/5
Can't get the Governator? Cast a real actor!:::1:::3/4
The odor of musty, late-'80s nostalgia may still hover around this already threadbare brand, but you simply don't see movies that leave both the curious and the fans who truly care this viscerally satisfied anymore.:::1:::3/5
Nothing can disguise the fact that it's ... contrived, chaotic and ultimately pointless:::0:::2.5/5
It's no "Aliens", but it does have an intriguing setup, good pace and a surprisingly action-ready Adrien Brody.:::1:::2.5/4
If it's not going to be smart, it could at least have the decency to not also be boring.:::0:::1/4
Starts out with a bang but ends up with a thud.:::0:::3/10
An obvious improvement over the two Alien vs. Predator movies...:::1:::2.5/4
When Mr. Brody starts running about bare-chested near the finale -- you'll want to applaud his exquisitely chiseled torso. Sadly, a six-pack does not a movie make.:::0:::None
to say that it is the best of the Predator sequels is little more than faint praise:::0:::2.5/4
Antal is a good enough action director that some of the combat is pretty exciting.:::1:::None
At the midpoint... it got more and more confined, claustrophobic and flatter.:::0:::None
If you're one of those people who don't want to be annoyed by those irritating elements like plot, characterization, depth, common sense or logic, then [this] is the movie for you...:::0:::None
You wince at the cheesy dialogue poor Brody is obliged to mouth and wonder what such actors as Laurence Fishburne, Alice Braga and Topher Grace are doing here.:::0:::2/5
Antal's and Rodriguez's determination to pay tribute to the original film sometimes slips from homage to simple repetition. But they do bring enough new stuff to the table to make it worth any B-movie lover's time seeking this out.:::1:::3/5
Since these aliens just live to parachute humans into their game preserve, you're left thinking they instead play canasta, cuddle with one another and hop through open fields like bunny rabbits because they sure haven't evolved to modern expectations.:::0:::2/5
It was decent. I wish it had been great.:::1:::3/5
An unapologetically violent, B-movie popcorn chomper, Predators is the true successor to 1987's beefy, steroid-friendly original and real summer movie fun. Adrien Brody, action hero? Who knew?:::1:::3/5
A sad attempt at rebooting an already used up storyline.:::0:::2/5
The return of some much needed intensity, excitement and darkness to this game of hunter vs. prey:::1:::None
Producer Robert Rodriguez has assembled a team of filmmakers to create what feels like the only genuine Predator sequel to date.:::1:::3/4
Keeps the Predator tradition alive. Adrien Brody found his true calling as an actor. He's got that face you can't trust but want to.:::1:::None
The third-act developments feel a bit too hasty, but beyond that and some cheesy-looking digital fire, Predators generally makes for 100 minutes of run-and-gun fun.:::1:::None
It's the kind of back-to-basics approach to B-movie filmmaking that fans will love, filled with great characters, snappy dialogue, and plenty of action. What more could you want?:::1:::3/5
What it lacks in imagination, it makes up in execution. It fulfills its limited potential, which is more than can be said of most of this summer's movies.:::1:::58/100
Predators is a movie you love if it's your thing. Key word: if. It's not mine.:::0:::2.5/5
Antal knows how to hit it and quit, a skill that bombastic directors like Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich will never develop.:::1:::7/10
They are still hunters. And this time, they're hunting us.:::1:::3/4
If you can't guess which group members survive, you probably haven't seen too many of these formulaic predictable action films.:::0:::C
It's amazing how just a little extra effort can make an action film's "talky parts" almost as much fun as the mayhem.:::1:::4/5
Antal conjures up some arresting visuals, like the opening shot of Brody waking up in freefall, and some well-paced action sequences as the cast is killed off in reverse order of billing.:::1:::3/4
Predators is brisk and busy, with plenty of other threats to contend with besides those monsters.:::1:::3.5/5
Almost a quarter-century after the B-movie that launched an improbable franchise, we get a reboot that simply spins it wheels, content to deliver exactly what most will expect from it and absolutely nothing more.:::0:::None
Fans had hoped that having Robert Rodriguez as a producer would revitalize the series. Sorry, this is just more of the same.:::0:::2/4
It's too bad the film about fighting to the death against high tech thugs from space isn't more, oh, scary.:::0:::2.5/5
None of this is scary, and nothing makes sense.:::0:::2/4
There isn't anything as comically grisly as the exploding head or Carl Weathers' arm removal, both well-remembered moments from the original Predator.:::0:::None
Predators needed more predators.:::0:::C
A spirited, slickly mounted production that suffers more from sins of omission than commission, yet is anchored by performances that remind us while otherworldly hunters may be the stars of Predator series, humans still matter.:::1:::C+
It has fun showing us that humans can, indeed, be the most dangerous game.:::1:::3/4
This small-minded reshuffling of the "Predator" franchise that began in 1987 is little more than a modern sci-fi B-movie filled with more plot holes than you can count.:::0:::C-
Often lazy and somewhat tedious, but mindlessly exciting and thrilling on a purely visceral level thanks to Nimrod Antal's deft directing skills.:::1:::6.765/10
It took twenty-three years, but Predator has finally found a worthwhile heir.:::1:::B+
After the opening scene, there's not a shred of originality in this frantic sci-fi sequel.:::0:::5/10
Predators may not be the instant classic Predator was, but as an action-oriented Sci-fi thriller and an entertaining summer diversion, it fills the bill.:::1:::3.5/5
Antal is better with surprise than with suspense and as long as there's lots of action going on the film is good, old-fashioned Saturday afternoon fun ...:::1:::7/10
Predators mostly just suggests a bunch of grown-up men playing with toys and not bothering to invite the rest of us into their circle.:::0:::2/5
Some genre movies simply work out this way: Whatever their intentions or origins they percolate for about an hour. And then they sputter and hope that a promising first half will be enough to get by.:::0:::2/4
The dialogue is dumber than dirt, and the plot crumbles at the halfway mark, but the movie does what a loud summer blockbuster should, which is loudly bust blocks.:::0:::None
A stylish, lean and, well, familiar outing.:::1:::2.5/4
This chaotic stew of fire, blood, mud and explosives is so devoid of terror and suspense that any metaphorical analysis is rendered moot.:::0:::2/5
A fun call-back to its gruesome predecessor. What it lacks in machismo, it certainly makes up for with atmosphere.:::1:::C+
Predators is just another movie-machine, running on action formula.:::0:::2/5
The B-movie pleasures found in Predators make the original look like high art.:::1:::2.5/4
There is a point where I thought this was a misguided Apocalypse Now homage. There was another point where I thought: Adrien Brody is no Arnold Schwarzenegger. But in the end what really disappointed me were the underdeveloped character tensions.:::0:::None
Perhaps its best that Predators keeps its ambitions humble, but a dearth of inspiration makes this fifth Predator film dangerously close to a rehash of the first film.:::0:::2.5/4
Adrien Brody does what he can, but at the end of the day, he'll never be as badass and physically imposing as Arnold Schwarzenegger.:::0:::2.5/4
The main suspense lies in figuring out the order in which they'll be eliminated and who will be alive for the finale. Except not really: Algorithms could predict these things.:::0:::None
"Predators" is a B movie that knows its job, and does it.:::1:::4/5
Adrien Brody is trying to use the gravelliest, froggiest voice possible to sound tougher than he looks. Then he takes off his shirt and proves he is no Arnold (he's no Taylor Lautner, either).:::0:::1/4
Predators is good if gory grindhouse fun. It tweaks the conventions of the summer monster movie, even as it observes them.:::1:::2.5/4
After 23 years and three attempts, Predators finally delivers a solid sequel to the Arnold Schwarzenegger B-movie classic.:::1:::3/4
Predator fans, fearing another lapse into disappointment, can relax. Although it's arguably not saying much, this is the second-best movie of the series to have "Predator" in the title.:::1:::2.5/4
Predators tries to spice up the hunt-or-be-hunted thesis, but from the get-go, director Nimrod Antal's movie has nowhere to run.:::0:::2/5
If you plunk down money for a ticket hoping to see some mindless carnage, you're in luck.:::1:::2.5/4
I wouldn't say Predators is a great movie, but it's good enough, executing its simple premise with tension and testosterone to spare.:::1:::B-
It's silly, bloody fun.:::1:::3/4
Predators is a pretty good action movie for about 45 minutes. Unfortunately, it lasts 106.:::0:::2.5/5
All these years after Predator, these decades past the classic film, Most Dangerous Game, that inspired this genre, it's good to see the idea of the hunter becoming the hunted still gets the blood racing.:::1:::2/4
Right from its memorable opening... Predators is an adrenaline rush.:::1:::3.5/5
Brody does his best Clint Eastwood/Snake Plissken impression (yes, there is such a thing as good miscasting), but he knows what kind of movie he's in; watch him practice his "tough guy" faces even when he's in the background of a shot.:::1:::None
This movie is admirably stripped-down and simplified.:::1:::3/5
The make- up effects, by maestros Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger, are well done and not over the top.:::1:::3/4
A spine-ripping good time that evokes the spirit of the original films.:::1:::4/5
Predators doesn't live up to its potential, but it is a step in the right direction for the franchise:::1:::B-
It always bugs me that sloppiness and/or distracting elements end up making their way onto the screen. But the action is decently handled and the film pretty much delivers on what its target audience is looking for. (Parental Review also Available):::1:::None
While it may be better than "Predator 2," the difference in quality between the two is almost too negligible to notice.:::0:::2/5
It will surprise, disappoint and ultimately anger those hoping this film may have, at least, upped the stakes to give Predator the Aliens sequel it always deserved. That shot in the trailer of multiple laser sights trained on Brody is a cheat.:::0:::2/4
[A] Xerox copy of the 1987 original... It's competently executed, but someone forgot to ask what the point of the whole endeavor was...:::0:::None
With significant input from producer Robert Rodriguez, director Nimrod Antal pays homage to the original while taking the franchise to the next level conceptually.:::1:::None
A stolid, uninspired imitation of the original...:::0:::2/5
Brody has the makings of a first-class action hero. Unfortunately, he is strutting his stuff in a third-rate action movie.:::0:::2/5
Predators is something different, a tone altogether absent since the days of the original. That it also stands up as a film of today makes it all the more enjoyable.:::1:::None
A vast improvement on that Vs. Alien nonsense...:::1:::3/5
Little Richard is sure to be proud.:::1:::2.5/4
quite possibly the best fan-service sequel of all time, and one of my favorite films of the summer.:::1:::None
What starts with so much promise and intrigue devolves into a more predictable cat- and-mouse game. The fascination wears off as the initial premise never becomes fleshed out and plot holes loom larger than the monstrous mayhem.:::0:::2.5/4
Fans of the original have likely grown resigned to disappointment with its descendents; Predators will not change that entirely, but it may summon enough fond memories to sneak by.:::1:::None
Does almost too good a job of following a roadmap conceived for maximum excitement in 1987.:::1:::3/5
A pretty decent, grim little lost-patrol mash-up of the original Predator and Pitch Black -- a perfectly fine night at the beer-theater, in other words.:::1:::B-
If you come out of 'Predators' thinking you've seen it before, it's because you have.:::0:::C-
Antal leaves the door wide open for a sequel, which is good news for fans of the genre. But please, don't invite the Alien to the party.:::1:::2.5/4
This time, the big, disappearing, dreadlocked hunters from outer space must face off against...Adrien Brody? Don't worry, action fans, it plays out a lot better than it sounds. Just pray he doesn't run for governor afterward.:::1:::B+
Brody is not the odd choice one might think as the leader of the pack here - he gives gravitas to his performance and throws out a good Hemingway quote.:::1:::B-
Fanboys will jump foursquare upon this movie, rolling around barking in delight and waving their collective paws in the air. That's me over there, third from the left.:::1:::3/4
The only interesting person is Grace, who grasps the essential absurdity at work here and, eyebrow cocked knowingly, runs with it:::0:::1/5
A faithful, respectful hat tip to a franchise loved the world over.:::1:::3/5
Predators is reasonably entertaining, thanks to some enjoyable set-pieces and mostly decent performances, but it's never as thrilling as it ought to be.:::1:::3/5
Predator purists (is that an oxymoron?) have nothing to fear: This is a worthy follow-up.:::1:::None
This story has been done to death, but the twists screenwriters Michael Fitch and Alex Litvak came up with are really inane. One of them is completely predictable, when you think about the casting.:::0:::2/4
A well-crafted, solidly entertaining meat-and-potatoes action movie that gives the titular creatures their best showcase since the original Predator.:::1:::None
A much need shot of adrenaline in a summer dominated by emo-vampires, and ten year old action heroes.:::1:::8/10
'Predators' is the sequel to the original movie that we've been waiting for - for a very long time.:::1:::3.5/5
After so many iterations in every possible medium, the Predator series needed a shot of vitality, not another workmanlike go-around.:::0:::C
Frankly, one expects a little more from Robert Rodriguez:::0:::3/5
Predators proves to be the '80s revival movie that's most adept at tribute, homage and other euphemisms for stealing, primarily because it performs its salvage job with such playful energy.:::1:::B
Antal is a professional who respects your dollars. In a season where the blockbusters are as flat as month-old soda, that's the most romantic gesture a commercial filmmaker can make.:::1:::3.5/4
In the end, Predators devolves into a succession of warrior-to-warrior battles. This stuff is fun but not terribly exciting.:::0:::2.5/5
More is not necessarily scarier in this often lively but scattered reboot.:::0:::None
What we really have here when all is bled and done is a fan-friendly homage to the original 1987 Predator.:::1:::3/5
For a movie with an all-action style, there's a little more down time than you'd expect but both sci-fi and gore fans should easily get their fix.:::1:::3/5
A tight, surprising, well made action flick that relishes in macho-ness.:::1:::3/5
It's a dumb action movie in a summer full of dumb movies, and yet it's always entertaining. And you won't really miss Arnold at all.:::1:::2/4
Predators is a well-crafted film, but it is joyless.:::0:::C+
This film's big innovation is a Hemingway reference and the creation of two different predator tribes involved in a (gooey green) blood feud. But my biggest question is: Why do you and the other "elite" fighters waste all your ammunition shooting like, a:::0:::B-
A great film whenever the actors aren't actually required to deliver any lines.:::1:::3.5/5
Unlike the original Predator, helmed by the intuitive and typically fast-and-loose director John McTiernan, Predators is clearly the product of a self-conscious craftsman.:::1:::2.5/4
Predators begins with a freefall and dive-bombs from there, toward a closing line summing it up: "Let's get off this (blank)in' planet," one survivor of alien evisceration says to another, speaking for anyone ready to get out of the (blank)in' theater.:::0:::D
One of this summer's few movies that deserves to be called fun ... Suffice to say that Predators has the perfect amount of oozing, neon-green alien goo.:::1:::3.5/5
Predators is a midsummer surprise that should restore some life to a franchise that seemed to me to be well past its expiration date.:::1:::None
As the humour and colour drain out of the film, the same-old monsters arrive and we end up in near darkness, barely able to comprehend what we're doing watching this nonsense one more time.:::0:::2/5
Superb pacing, robust acting and a very fishy Fishburne all help to overshadow some poorly directed set pieces and ensure that the mandible-possessing aliens are back hunting with the requisite bang.:::1:::3/5
Let's be honest: you see a Predator movie for the bone-crunching battles between alien and man, and on that front, Antal's film delivers in spades, with blood spilled, spines split and heads separated from bodies at regular intervals.:::1:::3.5/5
It's not a 'reboot', or a 'reimagining', of the 1980s, Arnie-starring, cult classic, man-versus-monster pic. It's more like the ultimate work of fan-fiction.:::1:::4/5
It lacks the quiet suspense of the first Predator, and please don't even mention the Alien vs. Predator pictures, which lacked the subtlety of Mothra vs. Godzilla.:::0:::2/4
Here's to director Nimrod Antal, who since coming to Hollywood has managed to not only overcome an unfortunate name but also at least two unpromising movie assignments.:::1:::3/4
Nimrod Antal's movie makes for a far more satisfying sequel than the weak 1990 follow-up or any of the "AVP" movies, maybe because it makes more of an effort to create the vibe and tension that worked so well in the original.:::1:::7/10
PREDATORS is a pretty awesome flick...[it's] loaded with action, gore, and freakin' cool Predators; this is what summer movies are made of.:::1:::4/5
Predators sets out to pay homage to the original movie by echoing it, but instead it mostly ends up duplicating it.:::0:::3/5
An unnecessary reboot of the 1987 cult movie. Quite literally every image, every idea in Predators, is a straight steal from another film.:::0:::0/5
Better than Predator 2, not a patch of the original. A throwback game-of-death, Rodriguez and Antal's sequel hurls out plenty of gore but few surprises. Left wide open for unlimited sequels, could this be a vehicle for RR to blood new directors?:::1:::3/5
While it's as fresh as the skinned corpses hanging from the trees, the 'ten little Indians' set-up never tires and Antal keeps the action brisk and bloody enough to make you forget you've seen it all before.:::1:::3/5
As a fan of Schwarzenegger's macho, heart-of-darkness original, it gives me no pleasure to say that Predators is an uninspired mess of mediocre action scenes strung together until the final reel.:::0:::C-
This is the kind of film you go to expecting gore and shocks; ultimately these two elements, along with the predators themselvor such mega-sized proportions.:::1:::3/5
Has a few sprightly moments but is overall pretty mediocre.:::0:::C
In terms of plot, Megamind is only slightly less complicated than Inception.:::0:::2/4
You have seen all this before.:::0:::2.5/4
The best animated movie of the year (*non-Pixar division).:::1:::4/5
Megamind is largely what one might expect from an animated movie featuring a number of notable comedians in voice roles: an amusing diversion.:::1:::3/4
This set-up is bright and amusing, even if it does feel recycled from bits and pieces of such recent animated landmarks as The Invincibles with its superpowers and Despicable Me with its villain.:::1:::3/4
A passable time-killer for kids, more boring than painful for adults, but animated films have established a higher bar to clear.:::0:::2.5/5
The problem with Megamind is that it wants to remind us, every minute, how smart it is -- and that sets it a world apart from Despicable Me, which is courageous enough to revel in its own silliness. Megamind tries too hard and ultimately achieves less.:::0:::6.5/10
Looks fun on the surface but suffers from a serious identity crisis underneath.:::0:::2.5/5
This is Ferrell's movie, meaning some inspired laughs sandwiched between annoying bits that stretch on well past their usefulness.:::1:::3/5
While this is certainly a case of the geek shall inherit, it still is tidy enough to entertain for the most part.:::1:::3/5
Cute and funny at times, but with a lot of dead spots.:::1:::2.5/4
Superb 3-D graphics and silly running gags (Megamind routinely mispronounces words such as school) should keep kids amused, while sly political and pop culture references will get laughs from adults.:::1:::3/4
The second animated film in the last few months where a super-villain plays the hero, Megamind was destined to have a patina of staleness.:::0:::2/4
Megamind has bright comic minds behind it - not mega but close - and 3-D effects showing what the gimmick can do when filmmakers care.:::1:::B+
Megamind is less a satire of dastardly deeds than a nimbly spectacular comedy of ego.:::1:::B+
Pixar mined the superhero genre far better six years ago with The Incredibles, and DreamWorks itself is capable of superior fare like this past summer's How To Train Your Dragon.:::0:::2.5/4
This is the kind of movie where "Bad to the Bone" is considered a clever musical cue because, you know, Megamind is bad. To the bone.:::0:::2/5
Megamind manages to be both commentary and comic book, and I have no doubt audiences will eat it up.:::1:::None
Unfortunately, the underdeveloped story and characters seem to be there to service the visuals, rather than the other way around.:::0:::None
I found my son's Kryptonite: boring superhero rip-offs voiced by check-cashing actors. At least Steve Carell used an accent.:::0:::None
A Mega-funny movie loaded with laughs, action and heart.:::1:::4/5
Though enlivened by some moderately clever twists on the superhero-movie template, Megamind never shakes off a feeling of been-there-spoofed-that.:::0:::None
The second big animated feature of the year, after Despicable Me, to center on an arch-villain who sees the error of his ways, Megamind is snappy good fun.:::1:::None
Megamind may initially seem like a superhero spoof in the comedic vein of Shrek, but it reveals itself to be smarter, funnier, and infinitely more sympathetic than that.:::1:::3/4
:::1:::B+
:::0:::None
It delivers a few thrills here and there but ultimately a bland story and forgettable characters turn Red into a mediocre action film at best.:::0:::5/10
A playful action blockbuster with a top-shelf cast and a refreshingly unconventional concept.:::1:::2.5/4
Oh, that "RED" was the giddy romp it might have been, it promises to be or it thinks it is.:::1:::2.5/4
Put your brain on hold for a few hours and you'll enjoy this light-hearted action comedy.:::1:::3.5/5
The best reason to get out there and see it is to see these actors take on this kind of over-the-top material. The fun they appear to be having on screen ends up being quite contagious.:::1:::3/4
The cast's efforts go about halfway to compensating for Red's lack of inspiration elsewhere.:::1:::2.5/4
All the stars seem to be having great fun playing goodies and baddies and running around shooting things. But they could do the same thing paintballing, sparing us from having to watch them and avoiding having to spend 60 million dollars in the process.:::0:::2/5
A fun little spy thriller that twists the old adage that you can't teach an old dog new tricks and suggests that perhaps they can teach you something new instead.:::1:::3/4
Si el entretenimiento funciona, ademas, se debe en gran parte a un atractivo elenco que se divierte como loco jugando a los espias y a los heroes de accion.:::1:::3/5
It could use more blammo. And more witty. And more everything else. But it requires nothing from you and, in turn, gives back a reasonable amount of action-tainment, so you still come out ahead in the bargain.:::1:::3/5
This is a flawed but highly enjoyable actioner, bouyed massively by its big-hitting stars and a cheekily dark sense of humour.:::1:::3/5
If the prospect of seeing Dame Helen letting rip with a ginormous machine gun while dressed to the nines tickles your fancy, give the film a go.:::1:::None
A visually explosive film that leaves little time to catch your breath.:::1:::4/5
Red is a goofball lament. It's saying that in the good old days, or at least in the good old movie days, our killers were good-time guys.:::1:::B-
Call it the film equivalent of the Traveling Wilbury's...a sly caper film that boasts an Oscar laden, all-star veteran cast yet is anything but old and tired.:::1:::B+
They're not too old for this shit.:::1:::4/5
The novel AARP-action vibe is loose and pleasant, even if the sensitive viewer can't help wishing gunplay and murder weren't so easy to accept as escapist entertainment.:::1:::3/4
...filled with the kind of sprightly paced, lighthearted violence that's supposed to evoke chuckles but mostly seems under-heated and over-loud.:::0:::C+
Typical action-blockbuster stuff, entertaining and mindless, that is elevated by the high-wattage cast.:::1:::None
Yes, it's silly. But 'Red' is above-average because it boasts so much serious star power.:::0:::2.5/4
The film's two romances are implausible, the dialogue is drawn out with geriatric pauses and the constant funk soundtrack does little to make sense of a plot more disjointed than Brian Cox's knees.:::0:::2/5
I can't say I've warmed much to Bruce Willis films before now. I went to see RED with no expectations, and came out thoroughly cheered.:::1:::None
While it's a movie richly endowed with big names, you come away imbued with the happy thought that they all left their egos at home.:::1:::4/5
Director Robert Schwentke sensibly gives his cast free rein but abandons any pretence of credibility as the retirees dodge numerous bullets and rockets. The venerable cast deserved a more intelligent vehicle for their talents.:::0:::None
With its self-deprecating humour, and a hilarious performance from Malkovich, the film -- though it never makes the least bit of sense -- is easy to take, and there are a few snappy lines of dialogue, too.:::1:::3.5/5
A fast, funny, smart, adult-oriented action-comedy that generates precisely the kind of giddy vibe The Expendables lacked.:::1:::3.5/5
It is Kick-Ass, with Helen Mirren as Hit-Girl.:::1:::3/5
A high-octane dose of summer-flavored fun, an AARP action film that comes along just in time to add a little levity -- and some serious weaponry -- to Hollywood's serious-minded fall awards season.:::1:::3/4
If anything, Red works better as a comedy than as an action film, which automatically makes it better than most of its peers.:::1:::None
RED offers cheap thrills and a few nice gags. It could have been more than that, but the appetite for this stuff is insatiable.:::0:::None
Expendable? Perhaps. Better RED than dead? Most definitely.:::1:::None
A daffy but enjoyable action-comedy that assembles some impressive oldie firepower.:::1:::3/5
Action films with a sense of humor can be the best medicine sometimes at the movies. It's just that this one has one joke repeated over and over again--and the one-liners aren't that funny.:::0:::1.5/4
No amount of jazzy cool can hide very large problems in the plot department.:::0:::2/5
A fast-paced romp that severs ties to realism early on and once we suspend our disbelief and put our brains into neutral, the film is a lot of fun.:::1:::None
It's all a big goof, but it holds together so that you can enjoy the ride rather than wonder if it will ever end.:::1:::3/5
A solid action comedy, but the flashy visuals and stellar cast can't hide what feels like a slightly missed opportunity.:::1:::3/5
Never tell Hollywood action heroes in their 50s and 60s, that they're a bit past it.:::1:::3/5
Schwentke must think his audience is very easily pleased.:::0:::1/5
An exhilarating and immensely entertaining movie relying on the old battleships of the screen to come out guns blazing for a sunset thriller with exceptionally high stakes:::1:::None
Like the camera, we jump, zoom, flip from one location to the next. The circumstances are far from predictable as is everything that happens in this syncopated film that sizzles:::1:::None
Its silliness becomes wearisome the longer it continues, but I found it as entertaining as, say, Clint Eastwood's Space Cowboys, and could happily sit through it again.:::1:::3/5
More playful than The Expendables, more charming than The Losers, Willis and co deliver a warm -- and fun -- actioner that benefits greatly from its seasoned cast.:::1:::3/5
RED is an efficient and expertly made flick, although it lacks a personal touch from director Robert Schwentke.:::1:::3.5/5
It's very silly and runs out of steam well before the end, though there are one or two gags.:::0:::2/5
Red may look tantalising on paper, but the end product is nothing to smile about.:::0:::1/5
The cast are clearly having such an immense amount of fun you really can't help but join them.:::1:::3.5/5
There's the occasional twinkle from distinguished performers obviously not taking it too seriously, but this is by and large a waste of their talents.:::0:::2/5
Red has its moments, including a finale that finally provides the action comedy vibe we expected all along, but it still has to count as a mild disappointment:::0:::2/4
This action-comedy has a wacky tone that's entertaining but never involving.:::0:::2.5/5
Good fun, and though it breathes hard in the second half, the ensemble has charisma to spare.:::1:::3/5
What Red lacks in incomprehensible muscle-bound meatheads it makes up for in humour, story and action.:::1:::3/5
Beneath its light exterior is not only a neat, if unsubtle, political undercurrent but a rebellious streak about how the allure of firing an RPG outweighs the prospect of retirement.:::1:::3/5
It is the strong cast, which also includes Richard Dreyfuss and Brian Cox, which elevates this film and makes it a fun watch.:::1:::4/5
It's a fast-paced action-comedy with strong visual effects and enough spark in the dialogue to be good fun, but its trashy spy novel sensibilities mean the characters and plot will soon be forgotten on leaving the cinema.:::1:::3/5
Not many actors can get away with switching in and out of character, and yet Willis does it with ease, confident in our love. And we do love Willis.:::0:::2/5
Director Robert Schwentke adapts Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner's darker graphic novel and colourfully retools it as a sort of thinking man's Expendables.:::1:::3/5
Geezer G-Men gone wild!:::1:::3/4
This is a case of sheer quality and quantity of acting talent coming to the rescue of a wayward film.:::1:::C+
Red Shoots Blanks at Familiar Targets.:::0:::2.0/4.0
While not in the same league as Kick-Ass or Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Red is still overall a playful and highly entertaining action/comedy.:::1:::3.5/5
All the stars are fine and the supporting cast is never less than perfectly adequate. Still, there's something missing.:::1:::3.5/5
It entertains and then goes away, a perfectly ephemeral late-summer time-waster that for God knows what reason, cropped up in mid-autumn.:::1:::6/10
Say what you want but a group of old pros know how to make an entertaining movie.:::1:::7/10
Helen Mirren can do no wrong. Give her a sniper rifle and the world is but putty in her hands.:::1:::7.5/10
It's the kind of cast that lends more credence to the material than it deserves.:::0:::2/4
Red is "chick noir.":::1:::None
It veers between high-octane and dullish moments.:::0:::C+
I dunno how a film that climaxes with Helen Mirren wielding a machine gun could be this disappointing. But somehow, R.E.D. pulls it off.:::0:::2/5
Thanks to terrific performances by Parker, Malkovich, and Willis, and fine directing by Schwentke. I had a smile on my face the entire time.:::1:::9/10
Gathers a great cast that makes "The Expendables" look, well, expendable. This is an extremely funny, action-packed movie in which gimmicks such as Helen Mirren blasting guns don't grow old.:::1:::B+
A smart, slick endeavor that gets added mileage from its cast of seasoned screen vets. How seasoned? The arithmetic mean of the five top-billed stars' ages is 59; throw 93-year-old Ernest Borgnine into the equation, and the calculator starts to overheat.:::1:::3/4
Explosions! Sight gags! A bald, bombastic Bruce Willis! But Helen Mirren steals Red every time she opens fire.:::1:::3/4
Stars four Oscar-winning actors. It's not every day that you're able to use 'Helen Mirren' and 'heavy artillery' in the same sentence, but Red gives you the opportunity.:::1:::3/4
The winking, self-reflexive tone mutes any possible emotional investment.:::0:::2/4
Now this is a fun film! Okay --- it's' not Oscar material, but it has great cast and a lot of action --- and sometimes in this crazy, hectic world, that's all you need in a movie.:::1:::None
It's a totally wild ride, full of gun battles, explosions and fisticuffs, liberally sprinkled with the tongue-in-cheek comedy we've come to expect from Mr. Willis.:::1:::None
Well-cast action comedy is entertaining -- but very violent.:::1:::4/5
This is an impressive ensemble for such a slight movie, but in a story so weightless, it might just float away without these performances to keep it grounded.:::1:::6.5
Proof, if more were needed, that the artistic collision between the aging baby boomers and their comic-book-obsessed progeny makes for some mighty strange, but not unentertaining, bedfellows.:::1:::3/5
One of those rare action comedies that actually delivers action and comedy, and one where the alleged humor doesn't consist merely of wisecracking heroes blowing away cardboard villains.:::1:::3/4
While the action is good, the movie isn't as cool as it thinks. If you replace Bruce Willis with Gene Hackman, then you have a hit on your hands about these 'old' agents.:::0:::5/10
Much of the enjoyment comes from seeing these respected thespians so thoroughly embody cartoon characters; it's like Sidney Lumet directing Space Jam.:::1:::None
Retired CIA agents get dragged back into harness, and the is truth is that they couldn't be happier in this good-natured action movie spiced up with a dash each of comedy and romance...:::1:::None

What really works for Red is our shared history with the actors involved.:::1:::B-
Action sequences are just poorly shot. It feels like they took a few comic panels from the book, but you don't see the effects of a given action.:::0:::None
The kicker is in the casting: Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Mary-Louise Parker, Brian Cox and Helen Mirren all come out to play.:::1:::7.5/10
Director Robert Schwentke does as much as he can with the cartoonish story and stunts but after a while can no longer maintain the illusion that RED is actually about anything.:::0:::2.5/4
Red has ka-booms, rat-a-tat-tats and a wildly extended first date. It's edgy and fantastically gooey -- and flaunts it.:::1:::3.5/5
Old people who kill people are so much cuter than young people who kill people, right? In a movie like RED, that's all we need to know.:::1:::3/4
They had me at Helen Mirren firing automatic weapons.:::1:::3.5/5
A fun spin on the spy genre with the seasoned veterans showing up the more inexperienced greenhorns. chances are you'll be seeing RED once the positive word of mouth hits.:::1:::3/4
A lengthy procession of geriatric-assassin jokes [that] offers a chilling portent of what lies in store should soon-to-be-ex-Governor Schwarzenegger ever return to the big screen.:::0:::None
That's some serious A-Team physics when you can put upwards of a thousand .50 caliber rounds into a bunch of cars and not even wound anyone.:::0:::2.5/5
Instead of remaining true to the much darker graphic novel, "Red" goes for the funny bone, using what amounts to wink-and-a-nudge stunt casting that never gets past its own cleverness.:::0:::1/4
Not that I'm complaining, mind you. The plot may be as creaky as the knees of its cast members, but as broad, big-budget spy yarns go, this is one that surprisingly doesn't require a nip, tuck or lift.:::1:::3/5
When people this talented get together there's an expectation of entertainment that this inert comic book adaptation just doesn't deliver.:::0:::1/5
The movie's biggest pleasure is seeing a bunch of old pros -- Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren -- having so much fun.:::1:::3/4
Patience is key when it comes to RED, the latest action ensemble to hit the cinema.:::1:::3/5

Red is an insult to our memories and to our intelligence, an unfunny farce whose veteran cast is cashing a retirement check.:::0:::None
If you're missing the rush you get from a great, fun summer movie, bundle up, go watch RED and have a blast.:::1:::5/5
Malkovich's performance is over-the-top even for him, and Freeman seems to be waiting for a call from his agent.:::0:::None
It's as if the studio simply assembled a huge pile of money in the middle of the back lot, set it ablaze and started filming. And I wish they had, because it would have been more interesting to watch than this.:::0:::1.5/4
It's a slight movie, but there is pleasure to be had...:::1:::2.5/4
An action comedy as entertaining to watch as it evidently was to make.:::1:::3.5/5
Only in Hollywood is someone seriously old at 55, but this is the underlying thesis of Red, and it works like a well-worn charm.:::1:::None
Red, perhaps the first CIA-AARP flick, fits seniors with grenade launchers instead of slippers. I say it's about time.:::1:::3/4
I literally shed a nerd tear because I could not handle the awesome nature of the action sequences in this film. Imagine the Ocean's films with machine guns.:::1:::4/5
The one-liners zing right along with the bullets in a playful pas de deux of mayhem, misdirection and mordant humor.:::1:::2.5/4
What makes this movie so much fun is the cast.:::1:::7.5/10
Parker, busy with her TV series Weeds of late, doesn't make a lot of movies. So it's a pleasure to see her tossing off sly asides in the face of danger.:::1:::B+
[Strikes] a careful balance between quasi-cartoonish shoot-outs and oddball humor, which ranges from droll to silly without ever going too far over the top.:::1:::4/5
In an industry, and in fact a country, that only appreciates youth, it's nice to see a movie about "old" people.:::1:::3/4
As all-star action romps go, Red doesn't reinvent the wheel or anything, but it's a lot more fun than The Expendables.:::1:::3/5
It is possible to have a good time at RED, but it is not a very good movie. It doesn't really try to be, and given the present state of the Hollywood economy, this may be a wise choice.:::0:::2/4
Unfortunately, while Red's stars may have gotten better with age, its many cliches have not.:::0:::C+
An excruciating bore on screen without a sense of wit, fun or action worth your attention. With Red, Schwentke earns his spot on the not-to-watch list and the Hoebers must be taken into custody and thrown into cinema jail.:::0:::1/4
The star turns are Red's raison d'etre, with the winking performances filling the place of any credible dramatic tension.:::0:::2/4
Almost becomes a can't miss film because of John Malkovich.:::1:::3/4
Bruce Willis hasn't been given material this solid to work with in years.:::1:::B
Although it's full of wasted potential, Red is a prime example of a mediocre film elevated by raw star power.:::1:::3.5/5
...nothing in Red feels real, just relatively entertaining.:::1:::3.5/5
"RED" is a smart, well directed action film that counts among its cast an incredible fourteen Academy Award nominations and four Awards.:::1:::3.5/4
Dame Helen Mirren looks like Martha Stewart on the outside but Rambo on the inside; you won't see anything sexier this year than Mirren wielding an automatic weapon.:::1:::7/10
OK, so this is not exactly Shakespeare or even David Mamet. It's more like Mad magazine's "Spy vs. Spy" on crystal meth, or a geriatric "Kick-Ass.":::1:::B+
There's fun to be had with Mirren's Victoria and, even more so, John Malkovich's weird, LSD flashbacking Marvin Boggs, but the plot is pretty humdrum and the film ultimately forgettable.:::0:::C+
If the story made more sense and the humor were more abundant, this could have been a bona-fide winner. Instead it falls smack in the realm of forgettably mediocre.:::0:::2/4
Having lost all intrigue by the sub-standard third act, the picture becomes a sluggish chore that takes far too long to reach its dopey finish.:::0:::2/4
Who knew Helen Mirren would be all sorts of awesome with an Uzi? We did.:::1:::B
While not perfect, RED is the popcorn film of the fall season, not to mention more entertaining than most of the pictures from what was a pathetic summer.:::1:::B+
Red isn't edifying, ennobling, or artful. It's just an utterly satisfying combination of big kicks, cheap thrills and real laughs.:::1:::B
Just as inexhaustibly stupid and utterly routine as any number of John Cena, Paul Walker or Vin Diesel vehicles those young whipper-snappers eat up.:::0:::2/5
How it all ends up is significantly less interesting than how they get there. It's a hoot to watch the elegant Mirren shift from high heels to combat boots, as she gamely goes from arranging flowers to being locked and loaded.:::1:::2.5/4
An amusing action-movie romp, 'RED' boasts a stellar ensemble that makes up for its director's deficiencies.:::1:::4/5
It's not that it doesn't have effective moments, it's that it doesn't have as many as it thinks it does. The film's inescapable air of glib self-satisfaction is not only largely unearned, it's downright irritating.:::0:::2.5/5
Though the actors are all, in theory, welcome company, this ensemble never really gels.:::0:::None
It's halfway between comedy and action, and it doesn't quite work as either.:::0:::2/4
Give me Helen Mirren with a semi-automatic weapon and Morgan Freeman smiling, "We're getting the band back together," and I will happily settle back and enjoy the popcorn.:::1:::B+
RED positively dares you not to have a good time.:::1:::3/4
Red is never quite the kick-in-the-pants that it should be.:::0:::2.5/4
Although there's no dearth of spectacular gunplay and fisticuffs in Robert Schwentke's light-hearted actioner, what makes RED really rock is old-fashioned movie-star style.:::1:::3.5/5
What might have been a guilty-pleasure romp is hobbled by poor direction, sloppy pacing, and a story line that can't decide whether it's farce or a retread.:::0:::2/4
This is a capable, experienced cast with extensive acting chops, and it's trashy fun watching them descend to the level of the material, which has Mirren in a sleek ball gown, capably letting rip with a 50-caliber machine gun...:::1:::B-
Attitude is what drives this movie from its opening sequence through to the turning point:::1:::3.5/5
What The Expendables could have been.:::1:::None
Too long, too busy, too loud, and too reliant on slam-bang stunt work, Red's glib dialogue and sinister government scenarios begin to wear.:::0:::2.5/4
The movie's goal, shrewdly, is to see how much fun its collection of Oscar nominees and winners can have playing the Over the Hill Gang of espionage. Plenty, as it turns out.:::1:::B
Like boarding a sinfully designed roller coaster that keeps breaking down during the frantic ride...a picture with incredible concentration to surface details, but a turgid bore in the suspense realm.:::0:::C+
The ensemble is terrific. These are pros at work here, and they not only show up the new action-star punks but prove they're far from expendable.:::1:::B+
What it lacks in originality, it makes up for in Helen Mirren with a gun, which should be a requirement of all movies from now on.:::1:::3.5/5
RED really had the chops to go the distance. Somewhere along the line, it wandered off the path.:::0:::C+
Red starts to devolve into nonsense well before it takes advantage of the many things it has going for it.:::0:::2.5/5
RED is an average shoot-'em-up except for the wrinkled fingers pulling triggers... as if the AARP issued licenses to kill.:::1:::B-
Laced with enough laughs to make this work as both an action ride, and a comedy. Mirren and Malkovich steal the show.:::1:::8/10
A pitch-perfect parody of over-the-hill action heroes nails and sustains the right tone throughout. Of course, when you've got Helen Mirren stationed behind a mounted machine gun, how can you fail?:::1:::3.5/4
Of all the washed-up washed-out over-the-hill too-old-for-this-sh*t action-hero movies we've had thrown at us this year... Red is by far the most amusing, the most clever, the most tongue-in-cheek, the most fun...:::1:::None
This geriatric spy caper provides a showcase for a gray ensemble that's obviously enjoying themselves, but they're having more fun than we are.:::0:::C+
RED stands for "Retired, Extremely Dangerous," though "Reasonably Entertaining Diversion" works too.:::1:::2.5/4
RED is neither a good movie nor a bad one. It features actors we like doing things we wish were more interesting.:::0:::2/4
The low-energy, high-boredom Red is exactly like every other spy movie, except the spies are older.:::0:::1.5/5
Helen Mirren in evening wear and combat boots blazing away at the bad guys and looking like the epitome of sophistication while she's doing it. What else do you need to know?:::1:::4/5
None of it holds together if you think about it too much, but the movie works because, for the most part, you're never tempted to.:::1:::3/5
Lives up to the talent involved, using the eccentric ensemble to elevate a loopy action-comedy-romance.:::1:::3.5/5
This latest adaptation of a hip graphic novel fails to fill in the spaces between the action with anything terribly interesting.:::0:::None
Red isn't a great movie, but it's great fun, and if that sounds like damning with faint praise, you take things too seriously.:::1:::4/5
... a star-studded, action-packed, loaded-with-laughs, great time!:::1:::4.5/5
As an exercise for movie stars of a certain age, it sure outclasses The Expendables.:::1:::3/4
Compared to such generic, flashy duds as Knight and Day or The Expendables, Red goes down like a flute of fine champagne. Here's how it's done, youngsters.:::1:::2.5/4
Red is an agreeable piffle, a fun action/comedy that's silly without being moronic.:::1:::4/5
Red instead exhibits all the get-up-and-go of a grandpa on the verge of an afternoon nap.:::0:::1/4
A spunky comic action drama about a colorful band of old timers called out oes, are sadly awol in this latest version.:::0:::None
It's not as much sheer fun as Predator, but then again, what is?:::1:::3/5
Predator fans rejoice! Finally a sequel has arrived that is worthy of its 1987 predecessor, in the ultra serious and equally bloody Predators.:::1:::3.5/5
Gory, action packed and full to the brim with rampant Predator action. What more could you want?:::1:::3/5
This is the sequel that John McTiernan and Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1987 original deserved, as director Nimrod Antal delivers enough hard core sci-fi, explosive action and monster mayhem to justify its belated arrival.:::1:::4/5
A solidly okay Saturday night effort, but unambitious considering the talent involved. Maybe Rodriguez should direct Predator Resurrection, but get a science fiction writer to script it.:::1:::3/5
It's a return to the suspenseful, high-velocity form of the original Predator.:::1:::3/5
Though Predators isn't quite as well put together as the original film, nor do the sequences offer the same sustained threat, it's still enough to get your adrenaline flowing.:::1:::3/5
Full of surprises and twists, the action and the relationships between the contrasting characters keeps us glued:::1:::None
Delivering on its promise, Predators is a moody, unrelenting and attention-grabbing sci-fi thriller, filled with action, splendid visual effects and packed with undulating tension:::1:::None
While the first Predator movie was a vehicle for its star and the second didn't make a whole load of sense, Predators foregrounds the action and brooding menace of the bloodthirsty aliens.:::1:::None
For the most part Predators is B-grade fun in the best possible way.:::1:::3/5

:::0:::None
Overly concerned with creating the next Greengrass/Damon superteam with his star Angelina Jolie, Phillip Noyce forgets to tell us just who Salt really is and thus, the film lacks the punch that it should have.:::0:::4/10
A solid thriller that too often relies on action-- rather than character development-- to tell its intriguing story.:::1:::3.5/5
It's certainly not a bad movie. It's got enough entertainment value to warrant a rental on a dull night at home, just not enough to recommend rushing out to your local theater.:::0:::2.5/4
Jolie one-ups Bruce Willis in DIE HARD, being chased down, climbing walls, and blowing up sh*t not only without shoes but also without underpants.:::1:::3/4
A somewhat predictable genre thriller that asks the audience to accept its flawed premise and revel in the ensuing violence.:::0:::2.5/4
It thinks it's The Bourne Identity even though it actually has more in common with Gotcha! Not that there's anything wrong with Gotcha!:::1:::3/5
There are moments of well-crafted thrills in Salt and Jolie reliably carries them off, but the desire of the filmmakers to put off thinking about the finale until they absolutely had to produces a hollow lack of satisfaction.:::1:::6.5/10
Salt doesn't spring many surprises, but settling for smartly staged setpieces over twists and turns in an action movie sounds like a square deal.:::1:::B-
You have to take it on face value to find the entertainment -- and there's plenty to enjoy here thanks to Jolie.:::1:::6/10
Salt's urgency drains as it goes ... Just enjoy watching Jolie roll through her stunts, then -- a good time can possibly still be had by all.:::1:::6/10
The reason Salt succeeds is because it believes in its lunacy and goes for it in a frank, but fabulous way.:::1:::3/4
Salt could have been a pretty good brain-dead summer popcorn thriller, but director Phillip Noyce and star Angelina Jolie lend it too much weight without providing any depth.:::0:::None
Despite its sloppy, often outlandish, story, and obvious twists, the film does work, if only as an enjoyably intense, and surprisingly bleak, B-movie that rarely lets up once it gets going.:::1:::7/10
... director Phillip Noyce drives the film at a breakneck pace to keep the audience from noticing the convenient coincidences and oversights. It's a rush for all that...:::1:::None
"Salt" and "silly" both begin with a "S." That couldn't be a coincidence, right? Paul Chambers, CNN.:::0:::D+
Casting a lithe Jolie as the film's protagonist stops Salt from being a Bourne knock-off or a Mission: Impossible reboot and gives the tired espionage genre a novel twist.:::1:::None

full review at Movies for the Masses:::0:::1/5
What's most impressive about Salt (aside from Jolie's committed performance) is the film's relentless pace. I can't remember the last action film so devoted to being all action, all the time. Frankly, it's a little exhausting.:::1:::3.5/5
An aesthetically pleasing machine, with fine little witty touches.:::1:::4/5
Ovaj film moe se preporu&#269;iti kao zabava jedino gledateljima koji su pri tome spremni u potpunosti isklju&#269;iti vie funkcije svog mozga:::0:::4/10
Salt is a good bet for 100 minutes of fun but it doesn't have the spark, originality or true thrills of something like Enemy Of The State or the Bourne series.:::1:::3/5
Angelina Jolie reignites the Cold War in Salt, a welcome throwback to when action was thrilling and visible.:::1:::4/5
Where a good thriller rewards you with satisfying "aha!" moments when you figure them out, Salt gives you the much less rewarding payoff of "oooooookaaaay...":::1:::3/5
Daft, but entertaining enough while it lasts, and it's oddly fun to see that venerable villainess, the Cold War, showing the young upstarts how it's done.:::1:::3/5
Can an action film have too much action? It sounds unlikely, like a cheese being too cheesy, but here's Salt to show us different.:::0:::2/5
Salt certainly ticks most of the boxes, thanks in no small part to a breakneck start and the pulling power of Jolie.:::1:::3/5
John Le Carre can certainly rest easy at night but if you just want undemanding escapism it delivers the goods.:::1:::3/5
Jolie plays a killing machine as well as can be expected, but the chill factor here makes for a joyless, as well as preposterous, journey zapped of any joie de vivre.:::0:::C+
Why it should be so damn satisfying for women like me to watch these heroines kicking men around is another question. We'd surely be appalled by the reverse. Just call it a guilty pleasure.:::1:::None
Salt just does what a post-Bourne espionage affair should, with a minimum of fuss and a maximum dose of adrenalin.:::1:::3.5/5
It's pacy, smart, subversive and knocked out with such verve and attack that you're not in the least bit bothered by how far-fetched it all is.:::1:::4/5
A thriller jam-packed with ridiculous stunts and a plot that's arguably the most barking-mad of all this summer's blockbusters.:::1:::3/5
I spy a turkey.:::0:::2/5
By no means a classic, but nonetheless a job well done.:::1:::3/5
The plot of Phillip Noyce's spy thriller is continually and unutterably absurd, yet for the first hour, when Salt goes on the run from the Agency, packs a fair few thrills.:::0:::2/5
Salt doesn't mess around trying to be funny or romantic, instead focusing solely on the one thing that counts: pulse-pounding action.:::1:::4/5
Streamlining the espionage thriller to its finest essences, Salt efficiently moves its pieces into place and proceeds to knock over the dominoes for a gloriously unrelenting hour.:::1:::4/5
Jolie handles the action scenes with athletic aplomb, a great advance on her Tomb Raider exploits, and changing the lead's gender certainly spiced up the angle of the CIA agent/spouse relationship.:::1:::3.5/5
There's still a lot to enjoy in Jolie's performance, and in the undercurrents of ambiguity in Salt, the questions of identity that repeatedly surface in the film.:::1:::3/5
Just one bombastically soundtracked set of crashes and bangs after another.:::0:::1/5
Noyce marshals the crunches and bangs well, and it zips along at a pace sufficient enough to keep the paranoia alive.:::1:::3/5
The focus here is less on creating a credible set of characters and motives than on manufacturing an excuse to have Jolie leapfrog between high-speed lorries.:::0:::2/5
Salt is certainly no Jason Bourne, but Jolie adds a good pinch of seasoning to the action genre.:::1:::3/5
Salt deserves to carve a path through the likes of BA Baracus and Sly Stallone to pick up the crown for this summer's top action flick.:::1:::4/5
The film is fluff, nonsense and artful tomfoolery, all at the speed of sound.:::1:::4/5
She's a very good character trapped in a quite good movie.:::1:::3/5
Although Angelina's star power is never in doubt, this is pacey and empty in just about equal measures.:::0:::2/5
Jolie is pretty much perfect for this sort of role, virtually wordlessly despatching assassins with machine guns, grenades, fists and -- in one particularly wince-inducing scene -- with a taser.:::1:::3/5
Intelligent filmmaking covers up the whopping plot holes in this action thriller. It's shot with confidence that makes it thoroughly enjoyable, with a few strong characters and a story that stays in constant motion.:::1:::3.5/5
The well choreographed action scenes mask the many weaknesses within the story.:::0:::B-
It is just a grand ride while you're there.:::1:::4/5
Salt is exciting and intriguing and doesn't waste a second of screen time; and there's still a surprising degree of suspense and unexpected developments along the way in this very entertaining yarn.:::1:::4/5
The real point is to give Jolie ample opportunity to go Bonding about, which she does with great verve. It's impossible to imagine any other female star in Hollywood bringing such ferocious conviction to the task.:::1:::4/5
An entertaining, fast-paced thriller with exciting action sequences, a gripping set-up and a terrific central performance from Angelina Jolie.:::1:::4/5
It's illogical and at times so silly you'll be choking on your popcorn. But that's all part of the fun.:::1:::3/5
Phillip Noyce directs Kurt Wimmer's script, which rockets along with chase sequences and confounds with double-crosses but it can't hide its essentially facile nature.:::0:::2/5
Salt is rather like a Tom Cruise film -- think Mission: Impossible or Minority Report.:::1:::None
This is a story of espionage that completely forgot to include any of the required intrigue and excitement -- basically a thrill-less thriller.:::0:::None
While Angelina Jolie delivers an engaging performance, the real merit of this film lies in its ability to successfully straddle blockbuster action and stylish thriller.:::1:::None
Shame about the nonsense at the front end and the dunderheaded ending, but the middle act was worth the ticket price.:::1:::C+
It's a movie that gets the job done, as director Phillip Noyce delivers pounding action and exciting chases with efficiency - though with a slightly dour attitude.:::1:::3/4
Is Salt a double agent or a triple agent? Did she really marry for love or for professional cover reasons? We swing on tenterhooks as the story reveals new angles and deeper layers, all the while hoping that Salt doesn't let us down:::1:::None
Adrenalin-charged action, assured direction and a star turn by Angelina Jolie makes Salt the best condiment on the action thriller movie menu:::1:::None
I should have been spending time considering why the defector would lie and why Salt would run, but I couldn't get past wondering why there are so many ponderous flashbacks.:::0:::2/4
Salt's centerpieces are assuredly helmed but lacking in imagination:::0:::C+
Director Phillip Noyce does a first-rate job of combining the requirements of modern action film-making with the old-fashioned need to actually know what's going on, creating a string of chase sequences that are authentically thrilling.:::1:::None
We begin with Jolie blonde and beaten. We later realize she can handle herself. It's just that the mission she's on doesn't matter.:::0:::4/10
Amid all the hubbub, Salt emerges as a remarkably efficient character, unapologetically preposterous and unburdened by dialogue.:::1:::None

Easily the best action film not directed by Christopher Nolan to come around in quite some time...:::1:::3.5/4
Salt is an unabashed throwback to Cold War conspiracies and ludicrous Robert Ludlum-like plotting (ironic, given that Hollywood had the good sense to update his Bourne character).:::1:::C+
An old-school trouper rather than a newfangled wink-and-nudger, Noyce ensures that the film keeps a straight face, even when Jolie's acrobatics seem more Lara Croft than Langley, Virginia.:::1:::3/4
[Thanks to the] kickass persona of Jolie, Salt is a relentless spy thriller that never slows down.:::1:::3/4
When you see Jolie leap from bridges onto moving semis or when you see how she ingeniously gets a cop to drive with the help of a stun gun, you're essentially looking at the female version of James Bond. Jolie knows it, and she owns it.:::1:::B+
Never a dull moment.:::1:::3/4
Salt is less fun than it sounds.:::0:::2/5
...agil o bastante para divertir, curto o suficiente para nao entediar e estupido na medida certa para nao se levar a serio sem, com isso, ofender a inteligencia do publico.:::1:::3/5
It's got some strong action sequences and some clever touches, but mostly the film gets bogged down in a ludicrous, hole-filled plot.:::0:::2/5
Salt is spilled all over the place. Angelina Jolie's latest is a shaggy salt shaker. After viewing the genre-abuse of Salt, we stumble out of the theater pole-axed but relieved.:::1:::2.5/5

I can't say if this nicely crafted nonsense will sell as a franchise, but I know that I miss the unpretentiousness of the Bourne movies.:::0:::None
Salt is a senseless blast.:::1:::None
To Jolie's credit, she is a convincing action star. She can't, however, take the movie's reheated world tensions and make them seem fresh. Long after James Bond settled his score with the Russians, 'Salt' picks up his fallen torch and wields it clumsily.:::0:::2/4
Angelina Jolie again steps up to the action star plate and easily hits a triple.:::1:::3.0/4.0
This movie goes back to the old-school style of filmmaking without relying on gimmick-laden CGI special effects. Its strong suit is keeping audiences guessing as to where Salt's...:::1:::3/4
It's too bad the actress spends more time jumping from pose to pose instead of getting to explore a potentially engrossing character.:::0:::3/5
Despite its problems, Salt is still rollicking summer movie fun and a great way to dodge the heat.:::1:::3/4
Very nearly saved, but only barely, by two things: craftsmanship and star power.:::0:::6/10
Salt proves Jolie has what it takes to stand in the spotlight as a prominent female action star.:::1:::3/5
Angelina Jolie is a marvel to watch as Evelyn Salt. In her many exciting action sequences AND in her few quiet moments on camera, she simply owns the screen.:::1:::None
A major dud - a picture that isn't smart, isn't fun, and is really just a great big waste of time.:::0:::1.5/4
There was enough people getting kicked in the face and punched in various places for me to feel like it was not a complete and total waste of my time.:::0:::2.5/5
It stirs memories less of John le Carre and more of Yakov Smirnoff.:::0:::2/4
Would Salt be as enjoyable if a man had played this role? Heck no. It's an amped up, throw-down, all-out action-packed example of girl power and Angelina Jolie kicks off her high heels and runs with it.:::1:::3.5/5
It's loaded with cliches, the story doesn't quite work... but it's fiercely entertaining to watch. If only they had found a way to get Jolie in a bikini.:::1:::4/5
An old-school spy vs. spy action film complete with elaborate car and foot chases, deadly sleeper agents and frosty-eyed, vodka-shooting Soviet stalwarts who lament the fall of Communism and chortle evilly over the possibility of destroying the [USA].:::1:::3/4
Do the filmmakers think of us as magpies, so easily distracted by shiny objects -- or, in this case, slow-motion explosions and fast-paced physics-defying chase sequences -- that we'll buy even the most outlandish plot holes?:::0:::3.9/10
Salt, a ludicrous but somehow credible spy thriller starring Angelina Jolie, delivers a swift, super-charged kick in the pants.:::1:::3/4
As a consumable resource, Salt goes down easy, but it's lacking both nourishment and flavor.:::0:::2.5/4
A more swiftly assembled spy thriller than anything since 'The Bourne Ultimatum.':::1:::None
The audience's relationship to Jolie as an off-screen superhero -- a bona-fide, old-school movie star -- makes her ludicrously competent character seem contiguous with her real-life persona.:::1:::None
This is a movie with a massive Cold War hangover.:::0:::2/4
How many times have we seen Cruise or Harrison Ford or Bruce Willis evade pursuers or, when the need arises, disable them? The sex change makes what transpires feel fresh -- and unpredictable.:::1:::4/5
Requires more than a suspension of disbelief to take it all in without gagging in disbelief.:::0:::C+
Tense, timely and enigmatic, it features Hollywood's most alluring female fighting machine.:::1:::8/10
Ok action movie that gets bogged down by a convoluted plot, but is elevated by Angelina Jolie's presence.:::1:::B
At every opportunity Kurt Wimmer's screenplay puts star Angelina Jolie into situations that are pure Hollywood hokum and from which no mere mortal could escape unscathed, although she always does.:::0:::2/4
Salt is a smart, fast, breathless blast of a spy flick that emulates the Bourne films in all the right ways.:::1:::B+
Thought the recently swapped Russian spy Anna Chapman was foxy? Hah.:::1:::3/4
Oh, sure, it's nutty-as-a-fruitcake insane... but being this hugely entertaining goes a long way toward making you not want to laugh at it.:::1:::None
[Jolie is] probably the most dynamic action star in the movies right now and certainly the most exotic.:::1:::B
Crushingly generic.:::0:::None
[T]he limited, forgivable absurdities... gradually give way to a level of pandemic preposterousness that makes Ethan Hunt look like George Smiley.:::0:::None
Angelina Jolie is definitely worth her salt as an action hero, but Salt is never worth its Angelina Jolie.:::0:::1.5/4
Salt is tasty in moderation, though you wouldn't want to make it a big part of your diet.:::1:::B-
Angelina Jolie is great and the film is undeniably expertly made but it's also shockingly lacking in personality or moments to make it register as more than just an extended chase scene.:::0:::None
Despite the dubious ending, it's truly a thrilling joyride and worth your time.:::1:::None
Adult popcorn fun, lightweight but durable, with Jolie trading up from her tomb-raiding Lara Croft days for a more complex but equally seductive blend of parkour-based action.:::1:::3/5
It all happens in such a frenzy of momentum and on-the-fly exposition that some of the more preposterous elements in the story will strike you only in retrospect.:::1:::3/5
It's nice to be reminded every so often that they actually can make 'em like they used to.:::1:::3.5/5
100 relentless, pummeling minutes of double-crosses, misdirections, and durable but disorienting action sequences:::0:::1.5/4
Angelina Jolie is one deadly weapon in this breathless political thriller:::1:::3/4
Salt proves what many suspect. Angelina Jolie has more testosterone than the average American male.:::0:::3/5
A highly produced but poorly written rogue-spy thriller featuring an intriguing main character that deserves a better script than this.:::0:::2/4
Between Jolie's innate cool, and her ability to dig deeper than most, if not all, of her male action contemporaries, she carries the day - and while she's carrying, she's doing her own stuntwork.:::1:::6.5/10
The kind of movie that figures if Angelina Jolie can jump onto the roof of one speeding truck, then wouldn't it be even better if she jumped onto the roofs of three speeding trucks?:::1:::3/4
An absurd, twisty thriller that flirts at genuine intrigue before giving in to the worst impulses of subpar spy fiction.:::0:::2.5/4
The best action movies can sell their implausibilities with a blend of style, pace and personality. In its indifference to such elements, "Salt" is a demonstration of how important they are.:::0:::1/5
Salt is a good movie for the first hour. After that ...:::0:::2/4
Some of the cheesiest '80s action movies were more fun than this one because their heroes were trained in a technique alien to Salt: a sense of humor.:::0:::2/4
When Jolie dons black hair (looking like a sexy aunt from the Addams Family) while wielding grenades, she's fully aware that she's sparking a new fetish.:::1:::73/100
So maybe we're not on the brink of war with Russia, but this intelligent, exhilarating Cold War spy fantasy almost makes you miss those days.:::1:::3.5/4
Salt is like a swell summer day at the movies back in 1984, when flicks knew how to do action and dudes named Vladimir had trouble boarding a Delta flight from New York to Washington.:::1:::3/4
Salt is swift and fairly clever, if not particularly original.:::1:::2.5/4
Overly complex characters, poorly edited action bits and a pileup of ludicrous twists leave this flick a flavorless mess.:::0:::D
Jolie completely rocks this fun, smart and unbelievably relentless action flick. Hopefully, this means we will see more actresses in leading action roles.:::1:::4/5
Salt is essentially the same movie as The A Team, [except] you don't feel quite as stupid afterwards for having watched it.:::0:::2.5/5
We need a reason to root for the hero. 'That's whose name is in the title' doesn't cut it.:::0:::C+
Devoid of thrills, excitement and cleverness, despite an abundance of slick action sequences and Angelina Jolie's sizzling physique---errr---performance. For more bang for your buck, go watch Inception instead.:::0:::4.21/10
Salt's okay summer fun though disappointing and ultimately forgettable.:::0:::C+
I'm fairly certain Salt is not a fictional drama, but instead an insider documentary on the secret life of Angelina Jolie.:::1:::3/4
Jolie does as well as she can with the twigs they've given her to make a plot house out of.:::0:::C
("Salt") is an adrenaline rush that keeps you jumping from situation to situation so quickly that you really do not have time to think about the many implausibilities raised throughout the film.:::1:::3/4
Salt started out successfully enough but quickly flew off the rails and smashed headlong into laughable implausibility.:::1:::6/10
Momentarily exciting but utter nonsense, a Burmese Tiger Pit built over a gaping plot hole.:::0:::2.5/4
"Salt" is a film that couldn't be more preposterous if it tried and if there is one thing that you can say about it, it is that it is always trying.:::1:::4/5
It's pretty much all chase flick and very little exposition. The problem is the film becomes SO far-fetched, you can't possibly turn your brain off and buy into its dizzying pace and twisting, turning storyline. (Parental Review also Available):::0:::None
I would be remiss if I didn't give mention to film editor Stuart Baird, who skillfully conveys the action on screen at a breakneck pace.:::1:::3/4
Because Salt takes itself with the poker face seriousness of the Bourne pictures only serves to make it more laughable.:::0:::2/4
Salt changes from super-spy to cartoon-spy, and good implausible becomes bad implausible in a hurry.:::0:::5/10
Salt seems aware of its own silliness, but that's actually part of the problem%u2014the movie thinks it's more fun than it actually is.:::0:::2.5/4
While they were busy setting up Salt for a potential sequel, they forgot to make sure the movie stood well enough on its own to merit one.:::0:::2.5/5
Preposterously fun, even if no motion picture named Salt should pass by without the story-thickening introduction of a nemesis named Pepper.:::1:::2.5/4
An impressive action-thriller that pulls out all the stops.:::1:::3/5
In a season that's meant to deliver mind-numbing jollies and has thus far failed, in the main, to do so, Salt deserves some credit for fulfilling its mandate.:::1:::B-
Salt succeeds as an unpretentious, confident, and fast-paced action piece.:::1:::B
Its narrative strategy is to leave audiences in the dark for much of the action, but each tidbit we're given fits into the broader picture. The action scenes are imaginative and elaborate without seeming fake.:::1:::3/4
Really, who goes to summer action movies for cast-iron logic anyway? Or for plausible characters, for that matter?:::1:::3.5/5
It's a slight but solid bit of filmmaking that fuels the fires of conspiracy theorists [and] there is something downright quaint about the way it weaves Lee Harvey Oswald into the plot without straining itself:::1:::3/5
Salt is a well-greased, smoothly functioning machine that drives forward with tremendous momentum, elevating your pulse rate and relieving you of the need to think for more than a second or two at a stretch.:::1:::None
Quickly sacrifices the slightest shred of plausibility in favor of mindless action, and becomes ever more preposterous as it rushes headlong to an apocalyptic finale.:::0:::C-
Noyce's methods of crafting suspense are defiantly old-fashioned: low-angle shots for maximum viewer disorientation and a preference for daredevil stunt work over CGI cheating.:::1:::None
The big mystery is whether or not Salt is a sleeper commie succumbing to Stockholm Syndrome, or just a peeved wife who can't seem to master the knack of folding sexy dinner napkins to impress her spouse, a specialist in North Korean bugs.:::0:::None
A relentlessly moving flick that cements Jolie's position as queen of the action stars.:::1:::3/4
As she tries to find her husband, and perhaps assassinate the Russian president, she's not quite sure who or what she is. And neither are we. Which is precisely why the whole thing works.:::1:::None
Despite enough hand-to-hand combat to glut an MMA marathon, this movie is about as much fun as getting slugged in the head.:::0:::1.5/4
None of it fits together very well, and if you can't see the big U-turn in the plot before it occurs, your multiplex occupancy permit should be revoked.:::0:::2.5/4
The relentless pace, hair-raising stunts and air of affected gravitas also goes a long way in boosting Salt a rung above much of this summer's other multiplex fare as a top-notch action thriller.:::1:::3/4
While the plot is outlandish, it unspools with obvious twists and turns. The film has its tense moments, but instead of dazzle, there's a workmanlike quality to the action sequences.:::0:::2/4
Jolie's action vehicle is just that -- an action vehicle, moving fast but thinking slow.:::0:::2.5/4
The kind of thriller that skitters after its star playing catch-up.:::0:::C

Noyce's past excursions into action filmmaking, most notably the Harrison Ford-as-Jack Ryan films, have been a bit flavorless, but here he delivers one from the gut.:::1:::B
...a well made actioner with a physically and emotionally committed Jolie performance that will please the popcorn crowd, but it doesn't have the intelligence of its forerunner, fellow Aussie director Roger Donaldson's 1987 "No Way Out.":::1:::B
Like the condiment whose name it shares, director Phillip Noyce's run-like-hell thriller starring Angelina Jolie satisfies a basic human taste -- something to go with the popcorn. I liked it. It knows what it's doing.:::1:::3/4
This high-octane spy thriller may be preposterous, but it's also preposterously entertaining.:::1:::3/5
It's hard not to enjoy 'Salt' with its vicious stunts, sincere acting moments from Jolie and a wig collection that would make Raquel Welch and Wendy Williams applaud.:::1:::B
Why is Angelina Jolie starring in a Jean Claude Van Damme movie?:::0:::2/5
The Fugitive meets Mission: Impossible in a post-Bourne era, with one thing all those movies lacked: [Angelina] Jolie.:::1:::3.5/5
Salt is a spy movie on the wrong side of ridiculousness...:::0:::2/4
Jolie in particular doesn't disappoint. Action suits her like a split skirt -- and this may be her best-fitting role to date.:::1:::4/5
So perfectly paced and quite well-made, but left open-ended for potential sequels rather than being concerned about telling a complete story, it's not nearly as successful as the movies that influenced it.:::1:::7/10
While Jolie saves Salt from itself several times, the film still demonstrates how her star power comes with a price when a screenplay can't match her smarts.:::0:::C
Even if the picture ultimately winds up being exactly what we figured it would be when we saw the very first preview for it, it still manages to hold our attention throughout.:::1:::3/5
It's everything a modern action movie should be, a picture made with confidence but not arrogance, one that believes so wholeheartedly in its outlandish plot twists that they come to make perfect alt-universe sense.:::1:::None
Needlessly leaving the door open for Salt 2: Saltier, Salt is politically moronic and narratively dead ... as predictable as a feel-good kids' movie.:::0:::2/5
It's like a rebuke to all the lousy action movie directors who've been banging pots and pans together in our skulls. It winds your clock tight and the alarm doesn't go off for 100 minutes.:::1:::4/4
Angelina Jolie's half-baked actioner feels like it was unearthed from some pre-Iron Curtain time capsule. Maybe back then we would've bought the wildly improbable plot.:::0:::1/4
There comes a point when it becomes difficult to take Salt seriously. That would be fine if this was an intentional parody of action spy thrillers, but it's not.:::0:::2.5/4

Celebrates greatness on four legs with a decent--if not record-breaking--amount of light entertainment. What're the odds?:::1:::3/5
Easily as good of a film as "Seabiscuit," and family-friendly.:::1:::7/10
Let down by a shallow, bland treatment and characters that feign depth and go nowhere. In this category, it is still 'Seabiscuit' by a mile.:::0:::C
A heavily contrived and overlong account of the greatest US horse in racing history, Disney's Secretariat still has a lot going for it as an old-fashioned family drama.:::1:::3/5
Secretariat is a good-natured but thunderingly cliched triumph-against-the-odds tale, almost every line a cornball aphorism about following your heart.:::0:::2/5
Like Secretariat himself, the film is a glossy, big-hearted slow- starter, but lacks his ability to power home ahead of the competition.:::0:::2/5
I'm sick of the simpering American morons who lap up this rubbish.:::0:::2/5
With its linear structure, nostalgic glow and distinct lack of surprises, Secretariat seems to have wandered into cinemas after leaving its TV movie hitching post.:::1:::3/5
Just when we thought John Malkovich didn't have another semi-intentionally deranged performance left in him, he has come storming back with another uproarious turn...:::0:::1/5
I think this is one of the year's most enjoyable family films.:::1:::4/5
Despite a decent performance from Lane as the homespun trainer, Secretariat is more blind alley than Blind Side.:::0:::2/5
This tale of wealth, horse-breeding and good old Christian faith is just about as hammy as a study of commodified horse sex can be.:::0:::1/5
Secretariat's story still feels untold.:::0:::2/5
Don't put money on it.:::0:::2/5
Bum-numbingly long bore that has a worrying number of talented actors seemingly involved for a cheque. Watch a film about dinosaurs instead; much more fun.:::0:::2/5
This horsey, 1970s-set Disney film doesn't boast the most imaginative script and is too long and businesslike for youngsters -- yet it still produces a lump in the throat.:::1:::3/5
Disappointing, frequently dull racehorse drama that's let down by poorly written characters, a thinly stretched plot, a painful lack of dramatic tension and a cliche-heavy script.:::0:::2/5
The old-fashioned Secretariat is surely one of the feel-good movies of the year.:::1:::None
Never convinces that this was a horse or owner who epitomized a time and so captivated an era. The against-all-odds cliches get slathered on, the races stumble, and the flick's further hobbled by all its pure emotions and heartstring-plucking.:::0:::None
Yes, it's a good, solid movie about a horse that no one expected to win.:::1:::3/4
Penny Chenery's story is good stuff. It's just that watching it, one can't escape the nagging feeling that it's not the most compelling part of the (Secretariat) story.:::0:::2.5/4
Secretariat is as sturdy and dependable as the stud it's named after. Plus, the ever-lovely Diane Lane!:::1:::B-
Screenwriter Mike Rich and director Randall Wallace somehow whip this fruit salad of tragedy and triumph and predictability and profound corniness into something wonderful and amazing and the best kind of Hollywood feel-good.:::1:::None
... you will believe a horse can act.:::1:::4/5
Secretariat is basically an amiable crowd pleaser. It's a good film about a great horse.:::1:::3/5.5
This powerful film grabbed me from the beginning and carried me through to the end and wrung me out emotionally along the way.:::1:::A
If you like sweet, safe tales of triumph, Secretariat is a sure bet. But if you like films with a bit more tension and complexity, this romp doesn't completely satisfy.:::1:::2.5/4
...oldstyle Hollywood, family entertainment done at a very high level. It doesn't lay out all the facts and complications, but it's a very honest movie.:::1:::88/100
Despite the Disney-fied, sentimental side of the story, 'Secretariat' hits the finish line as an effective tale about an amazing equine athlete:::1:::2.5/4
Well-crafted, shamelessly -- and obviously -- manipulative fantasyland stuff, passing itself off as a 'true story,' when, in fact, it's what we call 'fact-based.:::0:::3/5
Watching Secretariat is an experience as antithetical to watching an actual horse race as it gets.:::0:::1/4
Schmaltzy, uneven and contrived [despite] thrilling horse-racing scenes and John Malkovich's hilarious performance as an eccentric trainer who walked right out of a Christopher Guest movie.:::0:::5.10/10
The horse's story entertains but it would have been nice to have more of the owner's personal life explored:::1:::6/10
Crushingly unexceptional.:::0:::5/10
It's not about a horse, it's jockey, or it's trainer. It's about a horse owner. Instead of honoring the greatest race horse ever, they try to find an underdog story with Diane Lane's help.:::0:::5/10
The horse racing in the film is wonderful. It was shown from the horse's perspective...but I'm not sure the Oscar buzz is appropriate here.:::1:::B+
Secretariat rides to the Winner's Circle.:::1:::3.0/4.0
Strictly a movie for those who bet chalk.:::1:::B-

Excitement mounts with every hoof beat in 'Secretariat,' a real crowd pleaser.:::1:::None
A weak mediocrity that inspires no strong feelings one way or the other.:::0:::C
A throwback to an era where Disney churned these things out by the dozen, you?ll cheer, you?ll laugh, and wish you?d brought a hanky. There is, however, no photo finish.:::1:::4/5
An inspirational true story that oozes with so much inspiration, its overwhelming optimism becomes annoying and embarrassing.:::0:::C-
Until the Sports Illustrated subscription runs out at the Walt Disney Studios offices, I expect audiences will continue to be privy to cookie-cutter yarns centered around notable achievements in the sports world.:::0:::2.5/4
My advice: If you're looking for a nostalgic, inspirational horse-race biopic that doesn't isolate itself completely from economic, historical, and racial reality, go rent Seabiscuit.:::0:::None
Director Randall Wallace and writer Mike Rich steep the story in sappy sentimentality and some hamfisted nods to the era?s turbulent politics.:::0:::2.5/4
Lane + Malkovich + Secretariat is 2010's triple crown.:::1:::8/10
Very much a rousing, indomitable-human-spirit kind of story, except that by some miracle, most of the saccharine was left out of the recipe. The end result is a movie everyone will enjoy.:::1:::3.5/5
Just how much you enjoy Secretariat, Disney's glossy-coated biopic of the celebrated racehorse, depends in large part on how much you know of his career. If you know zilch, you'll be thrilled.:::1:::2.5/4
For those looking to, or through, Secretariat for a deeper, more sinister meaning, all I can say is, there are worse places to look for God than in the nostril of a great horse.:::1:::None
Secretariat is a winner, but only by a few lengths.:::1:::B
The film's formulaic nature was ultimately saved by Randall Wallace's stunning horse racing sequences. Even though we know the ending, I still found myself cheering.:::1:::3/5
Secretariat earns its best accolades for asking even larger questions as it highlights the story not just of a terrific horse but of his greatest champion, owner Penny Chenery, portrayed with grace, edge and a growing sense of self by Diane Lane.:::1:::3.5/4
The great John Malkovich is a hoot as Secretariat's trainer. How did he ever get into a Disney movie?:::1:::B+
The racing scenes, easily the best thing in this otherwise uninspired piece of inspirationalism, come as a distinct relief.:::0:::C
This is a rousingly entertaining and robustly acted movie with electrifying horse-racing sequences filmed from the jockey's perspective. Now, how cool is that?:::1:::B
Chenery is the main character, and as hard as Lane works (and as lovely as she looks in her '70s separates), Chenery just isn't a very interesting person.:::0:::2/4
Predictable but thoroughly entertaining and largely accurate story of the greatest racehorse of all time.:::1:::3.5/5
Inspiring true story about an amazing woman and her horse.:::1:::4/5
Neither winner nor loser, Secretariat settles for a polished mediocrity.:::0:::2/4
The film seeks to honor the memory of the great racehorse, and it largely succeeds.:::1:::B+
A solid, old-fashioned movie, at least until the overkill reprise of 'Oh Happy Day': I don't think the Edwin Hawkins Singers proclaiming that Jesus has washed their sins away has much to do with one horse beating the hooves off several others.:::1:::3/4
Even with the wooden acting and a horsepucky script that stops short of the finish line, once the horses take the reins, it's a thrilling ride.:::1:::6/10
(To the tune of "Mister Ed":) We?ve had us a film about a horse./Seabiscuit got Oscar nods, of course./So another race horse on us they?ll force: Secretariat!:::1:::2.5/4
The close-ups of the jockeys and horses in the starting gates, with the nervous pawing of the hooves, is thrilling enough to get even the most jaded moviegoer's attention.:::1:::None
There are two groups of moviegoers that will appreciate the dramatics of this great equine athlete: the over 50 crowd who lived through those exciting times, and those under 50 for whom this movie is an historical piece.:::1:::None
When the movie climactically reproduces that exhilarating Belmont, the fiction is just a pale shadow of the fact, and the realized myth that lives in our memory dies on the screen.:::0:::2/4
It's a pleasurable, seductive fantasy partly because, as we have known from the start of cinema, the sight of a running horse is a beautiful thing.:::1:::3/4
It may not break any new ground in the well-worn, horse racing movie genre, but this thrilling and inspiring entertainment about the legendary, 1973 Triple Crown winning horse should have audiences standing up and cheering.:::1:::4/5
If you're a fan of horse racing or if you're a fan of Diane Lane and John Malkovich, this Secretariat is required viewing for you.:::1:::7/10
A finely constructed feel-good movie, gorgeous to look at, suspenseful when it's supposed to be and firmly in control of the sports movie archetypes and tropes that it wields like an experienced jockey using a riding crop.:::1:::4.5/5
Director Randall Wallace manages to bring in enough winning moments to make it worth an afternoon's viewing.:::1:::2.5/4
If ever a film recreated the experience of visiting an OTB ? where you watch races on TV from far away, people are dressed poorly and it?s quite stinky ? then Secretariat is a resounding success.:::0:::1/4
So intent on being inspiring that it forgets nearly everything else, including story and character.:::0:::C
Scarcely a scene goes by where Penny's savvy, grace, and generosity aren't explicitly cited by some character or another, often in the process of apologizing for not recognizing her visionary brilliance in the first place.:::0:::1/5
Diane Lane borrows Sandra Bullock's blond wigs and can-do attitude for Secretariat, a horse movie that feels like a lazy workout rather than a high-stakes race. Secretariat is a strenuously feel-good flick that could be subtitled The Blinders Side.:::0:::C+
You'll cry like a baby, even though you know how it ends.:::1:::3.5/4
This is an undeniably well-crafted genre piece.:::1:::None
Secretariat" ultimately delivers where it matters, in the home stretch.:::1:::2.5/4
Director Randall Wallace has achieved the next to impossible, injecting genuine tension and suspense into a narrative we all know the ending to.:::1:::3/4
Even though the outcomes of the races run by Secretariat are history, you still will cheer this magnificent animal and his extraordinary owner.:::1:::3.5/4
The real Secretariat had a heart twice as big as a normal horse's, and Secretariat the film has a lot more heart and soul to it than most 'feel-good' family films.:::1:::B
An okay but rather obvious and, natch, predictable period sports drama. (Parental Review also Available):::1:::None
Don't fret when the film gets stuck in stodgy mud. Just bask in the glory that was Secretariat, and watch that horse ride.:::1:::2.5/4
The true-life account of the "world's greatest racehorse" deserves better than this bland adaptation from the Disney factory.:::0:::C
The true story of the recordbreaking Secretariat is pretty stupendous as is. It didn't need schmaltzing up.:::0:::None
"Secretariat" is a glorious throwback to the days when inspiring family fare often came from such studios as "Secretariat" source Disney.:::1:::A-
Proves all the more insane that it equates Secretariat to a Jesus Christ-like messiah.:::0:::2/4
A family film about one of the fastest racehorses in history, Secretariat stumbles along beneath the weight of leaden life lessons.:::0:::None
With a film like this, moments of emotion-run-amok excessiveness are inevitable, but a trio of interlocking factors keep the winces at a minimum and stop the film from going too far off the rails.:::1:::3/5
Unimaginatively directed by Randall Wallace, Secretariat often visibly strains to avoid painful or messy reality...:::0:::2.5/5
This one's all about the horse -- and he's a winner.:::1:::2.5/4
An unabashed crowd-pleaser of the old school...calculated and manipulative. But it does its job skillfully.:::1:::B-
What a pleasure to see the exquisite Diane Lane in a role worthy of her talent and beauty. In this movie, she is the champion who gets to run the race she was born for.:::1:::B+
The actors and the film's genial nature help it go down fairly easy. The racing scenes are well-shot and surprisingly thrilling, given the preordained outcome.:::1:::B-
Too often bludgeons us over the head with its inspirational quotables, burying the story?s organic goodwill under a pile of Hollywood horse manure.:::0:::2/4
The welcoming glow that imbues every corner of this nostalgic horse-racing yarn with rich, lambent color comes from within, as if the movie itself is ablaze with its own crazy sense of purpose.:::1:::None
a 2010 Disney tent-pole release that feels more like a 1965 Disney tent-pole release, but within its very specific trappings, it is a crowd-pleasing success.:::1:::3.5/5
It?s not a particularly great film, but by recognizing its own limits, Secretariat never tries to be more than a feel-good movie, and it's better because of it.:::1:::3/5
The Disney feel that makes it safe for the whole family also probably robs it of some of the more complex shading ... But considering how rare intelligent family-friendly movies are, it's a worthy sacrifice.:::1:::2.5/4
"It?s like trying to make a football movie set in the 1970s about this plucky little underdog team called the Dallas Cowboys.":::0:::2/4

The achievement of both the movie and what Lane does with the part is that it's all bait to write her off as a sufferer, a role that Lane, due to bad movies and the bad men in them, knows too well. Not this time.:::1:::3.5/4
I looked forward to it because I like Diane Lane, but about halfway through Secretariat, I realized that as much as I like her, I really don't like watching her run a horse farm.:::0:::B-
Wallace is a director of moments, not of cohesive wholes. His movie is a parade of confrontations punctuated by a thrilling race.:::1:::3/4
There's adversity, triumph, and lessons learned on the way to a happy ending. And upbeat scenes set to stirring, era-appropriate songs? Do you even have to ask?:::0:::C+
Aside from the inherent thrill of the races themselves, the new equine biopic Secretariat is dull stuff.:::0:::2/4
Secretariat is a traditional, by-the-numbers feel-good movie that's likely to leave you cheering in the end anyway, even though you know what's coming.:::1:::3.5/5
Terrific supporting performances bolster Lane's star turn, and some audiences will cheer in their theatre seats as though they were at the track, but Secretariat is ultimately a conventional story, conventionally told.:::1:::3/5
Diane Lane inhabits roles with the naturalness of someone who's spent nearly a lifetime in front of the camera, and she's the bedrock of this inspirational sports story.:::1:::None
Secretariat isn't bad but it's precisely what you'd expect.:::0:::2/4
Lined with fetid chunks of Oscar bait like so many droppings in an untended stable:::0:::2/5
When the movie?s over, it?s hard not to be more amazed that Secretariat fathered 600 foals. That?s stamina!:::0:::3/5
Far from substantial, spending far too much time playing up the horse?s mystique (cue slow motion and thunderclaps), and not enough on the gritty particulars of the human characters. It?s rarely dull, but consistently baffling.:::0:::C
I should know better. But it got to me, mostly because of the way the races are shot ? and because of the heartfelt and mostly underplayed performances by the film?s stars.:::1:::None
The racing sequences are effectively done and Secretariat's quest for horse racing's Triple Crown concludes with one of those stand-up-and-cheer moments, but the story as a whole seems stale and overly familiar.:::0:::2.5/4
It is a great film about greatness, the story of the horse and the no less brave woman who had faith in him.:::1:::4/4
Instead of feeling good, it just feels hollow.:::0:::2/5
Not exactly a beast biopic about sex and DNA or a National Geographic reproductive romance, but certainly about studs, Secretariat doesn't horse around when inferring that mares matter most, whether of the steed or human variety.:::0:::None
A rousing and heartwarming film, Diane Lane may get Disney the Best Actress Oscar.:::1:::4/5
A movie that?s just a little bit too slick for its own good, where all the pieces fit together with premanufactured precision. Still, when that horse starts to run, we can?t help cheering.:::1:::4/5
Anyone remotely familiar with the story of Secretariat knows the outcome before the movie begins, but that Belmont climax still is intoxicating to watch.:::1:::None
Secretariat isn't as gritty as it should have been, but it sure is happy.:::1:::2.5/4
Secretariat, a benignly inspirational Disney sports drama about the legendary racehorse who won the Triple Crown in 1973, offers a fascinating test case for how much spoilers sometimes don't matter.:::1:::B-
A cheesy, square, emotional button-pusher that often feels like a Disney movie from the era it's set in -- and that old-fashioned appeal actually works in its favor.:::1:::3/5
I'm a sucker for this kind of stuff, and there is plenty of it in Secretariat. This is one terrific movie about one terrific horse.:::1:::3/4
A family entertainment that the Brady Bunch would have enjoyed (if not actually starred in), Disney's real-life horse story, about the 1973 Triple Crown winner, is a solid shot straight up the middle.:::1:::3/5
The formulaic race footage itself is vigorous; the schmaltzy mythmaking script, on the other hand, deserves a one-way trip to the glue factory.:::0:::None
Secretariat all but ignores the horse it?s named after in favor of telling the tedious, mostly irrelevant story of his owner.:::0:::1.5/5
This conventional but rousingly effective picture pulls through its occasional faltering stretches by focusing on the essentials of its incredible real-life saga, even if the details have been massaged for maximum uplift.:::1:::None
A wonderful family film about the greatest race horse who ever lived that gets out of the gate quickly and impresses with its big heart and idiosyncratic characters.:::1:::4/5
As satisfying as it is stimulating, 'Secretariat' will make you stand up and cheer.:::1:::9/10
An engaging sports movie about the greatest racehorse ever and his female owner who literally bets the farm on his supremacy.:::1:::None
Diane Lane shines as the horse's owner.:::1:::B+
As formulaic as it is, solid family films like "Secretariat"f retirement to help an old buddy, a former CIA agent.:::1:::3/5
Highly enjoyable comic action-thriller with a sense of humor about itself...holds your interest while alternately thrilling and amusing, without insulting your intelligence.:::1:::None
Not to be confused with the early-'90s Kieslowski film of the same name. Definitely not.:::1:::3/4
There's fun to be had watching Willis and Parker banter, and listening to Malkovich toss off arrhythmically timed one-liners.:::1:::3/5
One of the most enjoyable things I've seen this year, and I would absolutely recommend it.:::1:::None
Classiest. Comic. Book. Movie. Ever.:::1:::None
Here's another pound of proof supporting the theorem that "story is about thoroughness, not shortcuts.":::0:::D+
Rowdy espionage by over-the-hill undercover hotheads that is less about belligerent bragging rights, than generation gap self-parody. And a PG rated Willis initiated phone sex sidebar for unrequited lovebirds, in prolonged perverse celibate CIA desire.:::1:::None
This is an amusing crowd-pleaser, pitting wisdom and experience against youthful arrogance and gullibility.:::1:::8/10
No one gets hurt, okay? See? He's just faking his death. Now let's get you some cocoa and a DVD of Miss Congeniality 2.:::0:::None
Schwentke keeps things light: light on big laughs, light on unique action set pieces and light on any sense that these game but retired spies are too old for this crap.:::0:::2/5
Red might just be the best romantic comedy of the year.:::1:::None
Red is long, predictable, derivative, and without doubt one of the most entertaining experiences to be had in a cinema this year.:::1:::4/5
The film is not entirely successful in evoking the goofy, satirical tone of the DC comic source material, but it's an entertaining fare for adults, benefiting immensely from its vet and skillful cast.:::1:::B+
Once it works its way up to a certain volume -- jaunty, one-dimensional, unserious mayhem -- it stays there, forever.:::1:::B-
Gripping smalltown thriller, with a strong script, superb direction and a terrific central performance from Brian Cox. Fully deserves its place in the Best of the Fest line-up.:::1:::4/5
Schwentke and his cast have taken some decent enough source material and polished into a small gem.:::1:::B+
An engaging, well-made action comedy that benefits from the talents of its decidedly mature cast members, even if it unspools with a pace better suited to their generation than the moviegoers that grew up watching their earlier movies.:::1:::None
An amusing, light-footed caper about a team of aging CIA veterans rudely forced out of retirement.:::1:::None
Although tailor-made for genre fans, it benefits from flavors of humor and romance that keep its appeal from being fanboy-only.:::1:::None
If you don't smile at the image of a stunningly beautiful Dame Helen Mirren, resplendent in a gorgeous white gown, plowing down gunmen with her 50mm caliber tripod mounted gun, then you simply can't be helped.:::1:::B+
Directors Colin and Greg Strause eschew things like a credible script and decent acting to focus on CGI enactments of hapless apartment dwellers being rammed into slimy alien orifices.:::0:::1.5/5
A big screen B-movie with a convoluted plot and limited scope - inundating viewers with melodrama instead of the alien invasion apocalypse occurring outside.:::0:::2/5
The filmmakers thought that all it would take to make a movie is some special effects, but this film only goes to show what most people already know: a film shouldn't be designed around something meant to be an afterthought.:::0:::1.5/4
Skyline packs some impressive money shots, however with its tracing-paper-thin script there's not enough propping up these whizz-bang set pieces.:::0:::2/5
Skyline might be a midnight B-movie, but it's also hopelessly inept and a grievous waste of time and talent with no ending whatsoever.:::0:::3/10
I think Skyline ultimately fails as a movie.:::0:::None
This pretty awful movie is from a team of visual effects-making brothers, Colin and Greg Strause, who've been making stuff look awesome for several years now.:::0:::2/5
...there is, for the most part, simply no shaking the feeling that the really interesting stuff is happening elsewhere...:::1:::2.5/4
Skyline has lots of TV actors going through the motions (Faison, Balfour, Brittany Daniel) and one TV actor (Dexter's David Zayas) giving a performance that's so spectacularly amateurish that it renders moot all of the other major problems the movie has.:::0:::None
With its lack of a big-name cast, and the Strause brothers' proven willingness to embrace bleakness, ...Skyline holds out - and then fulfils - its promise of anything goes, from the mesmerising intro to the bitter, bananas end.:::1:::None
It's got awesome giant spaceships and massive lumbering monsters and epic explosions and gory kills and it's ... a dumb-fun matinee flick for sure.:::1:::3.5/5
Visual-effects wizards Greg and Colin Strause directed, showing more affinity for the city's steel and glass than for any of the characters.:::0:::None
full review at Movies for the Masses:::0:::1.5/5
'Skyline' is an outlandishly awful excuse for a movie about aliens from outer space. People not only groaned at the end of this monstrosity, but one guy in the audience was so angry that he actually began to swear,:::0:::.5/4
Impressive effects can't disguise an uninspired reheat of space invader films.:::0:::2/5
A movie with this many quality special effects shouldn't ever be as genuinely boring as this.:::0:::1/5
Look up in the sky: its a bird! its a plane! No.... its every single alien invasion movie rolled into one epic fan film. Mind you, it does have a wonderfully messed-up twist ending.:::0:::2/5
Skyline, if not always successful, refashions the modern alien invasion motif as the hopeless siege that it should be.:::1:::3.5/5
A weak science fiction film that doesn't know how to end so it just stops.:::0:::3/10
The story's brain-snatching aliens must have attacked the filmmakers before they invaded the rest of Los Angeles.:::0:::2/4
If aliens ever invade Earth, it will be to stop us from making another movie as bad as Skyline.:::0:::0.5/5
the cheap-looking CG effects -- and creatures cobbled together fromthose in a dozen other movies -- make even the boring humans look interesting.:::0:::2/5
Stands alongside THE LAST AIRBENDER as one of the worst films of the year.:::0:::3/10
Maybe the Brothers Strause are to be admired for getting this cheesy trash into theaters instead of letting it be relegated to the SyFy Channel. They've got moxie, anyway.:::0:::D+
One of the worst movies of 2010...:::0:::None
The dialogue is risible, there is no headline star like a Tom Cruise or Will Smith, nor is there a young star like Dakota Fanning to give us a wide-eyed interpretation.:::0:::2/5
The premise of this low-budget sci-fi thriller might be familiar from Signs, War of the Worlds, and Cloverfield, but the lesser acting talent is more in line with Plan 9 from Outer Space.:::0:::2/4
Wait for the DVD and you won't miss a thing.:::0:::2.5/5
Skyline is pure eye candy, but it's mighty tasty.:::1:::2.5/4.0
How this managed not to go direct-to-DVD (and actually get a wide distribution rather than just a handful-of-theaters dump) is one of 2010's great cinematic mysteries.:::0:::0.5/4
While flawed, few will go see Skyline and not have fun.:::1:::3/5
Perfect drive-in fare. Too bad there aren't more drive-ins.:::0:::2.5/5
These aren't moviemakers who live even in other movies, let alone the world. They live in hard drives.:::0:::1/4
This isn't a movie: it's an FX demo reel... Skyline isn't about anything: it doesn't reflect any contemporary fears that afflict individual people or anxieties that grip our entire culture...:::0:::None
...a special effects-filled mash-up of alien invasion films, one that again poses the age-old genre question that has been on the minds of characters since "Night of the Living Dead": "Should I stay, or should I go?":::1:::None
Pure tosh. On absolutely no account pay money to see this film. Wait until it's given away free with a magazine and start at around the forty minute mark.:::0:::2/5
Imagine it's 1953 and you're watching a movie called 'Brain Suckers from Planet X', and you might even have a good time.:::0:::2/5
There are a couple of genuine surprises, and few pretensions about delivering an efficient, popcorn-worthy entertainment.:::1:::3/5
If 'Skyline' never seems interested in pushing the envelope, it at least begins with enough promise to suggest a competent thriller. No such luck.:::0:::2/4
Behold: it's Indepen-dunce Day.:::0:::1/5
an ordeal by tedium:::0:::0/5
A mess of a movie that reaches a completely ridiculous and unexpected (but not in a good way) conclusion.:::0:::1.5/5
Derivative enough to be called "Adherence Day," "Skyline" knocks off so many alien-invasion films you can almost hear commentary referring to "Cloverfield" or "District 9" moments. The "Skyline" moment? Future filmmakers won't be so stupid as to ape that.:::0:::1.5/4
Let me say upfront and with absolute clarity that Skyline is a bad film. So why don't I feel any animosity toward it? I guess because despite everything that was wrong with this film I still had fun and laughed more than I did at Due Date.:::0:::None
Yes, this is a genuinely so-bad-it's-good movie. This film is crushingly awful, tedious and moronic, but I was often howling with laughter.:::0:::None
The film plays like Cloverfield redux, except with less personality and tension.:::0:::1/4
Like Cloverfield, Skyline unleashes rampaging beasties on the streets, only this time they've arrived in massive spaceships -- and they're here to collect human brains. It's a shame none of the Skyline protagonists seem to possess any.:::0:::D-
There's a kind of magic that happens when a movie inspires complete strangers to ridicule it to each other on the way out of the theatre.:::0:::1/4
The only fascinating thing about Skyline is that that such a mad muddle of a movie can even exists in an era of corporate homogeneity and purported quality-controlled.:::0:::1/4
Skyline is a piece of junk, even in a movie climate littered with expensive -- though sometimes fun -- junkiness.:::0:::2/10
Trapped inside what looks like a Marina del Rey condo complex, the principals raise and lower the blinds, run up and down the stairs and occasionally venture outside, while the audience, if it has the energy, yells: "No! Don't do that! That's stupid!":::0:::1/5
The science-fiction thriller Skyline falls squarely -- and a little endearingly -- into the Roger Corman tradition of cheap cash-ins on popular hits.:::0:::C
makes the cliche-riddled guilty pleasure of Independence Day seem like the second coming of 2001: A Space Odyssey:::0:::1.5/5
So bland it's easy to forget the title only minutes after exiting, this Emmerich-by-numbers invasion movie exists only to offer you the cutting edge in unconvincing special effects.:::0:::1/5
A B-movie extravaganza, Skyline is a sort of sci-fi sampler of every alien invasion movie ever made.:::0:::2/5
One of the worst movies of 2010: an appalling distinction in a year so bereft of quality film are few and far between.:::1:::B
Based on the true story of a stubbornly committed housewife and her race horse, Secretariat is an overly explicit, extremely old-fashioned inspirational tale, elevated from the routine by Diane Lane's compelling lead and Malkovich's eccentric turn.:::1:::C+
A bland horse tale enlivened only by Diane Lane's committed star turn and a wily supporting performance by John Malkovich.:::0:::None

Unflinchingly honest and confidently challenging, this is an all around incredible film.:::1:::10/10
Don't cry for the movie star, even if they don't have the glamorous life you imagine:::1:::2.5/4
Even with its irritating ending, there's something so relatable about Marco that makes the story go, well, somewhere:::1:::None
Even so-called "slow cinema" shouldn't be this dull.:::0:::1.5/4
In "Somewhere," what ends up happening is that the main character's lack of interest becomes the audience's burden.:::0:::2.5/4
A movie star and his neglected daughter bond while partaking in the celeb-filled glamour of the Chateau Marmont.:::1:::None
Sofia Coppola gives us a first-class ticket to nowhere:::1:::None
This is a film about vacuousness that's without much substance itself.:::0:::2/5
A poor little princess' plaint about the burdens of being special.:::0:::83/100
[Coppola] examines boredom, privilege, torpor, laziness and adolescent daydreams with a kind of molasses slowness that no one else can touch. That's good because no other American filmmaker is really trying to touch it anyway.:::1:::3.5/5
The question is 'why should we care?' Yes Johnny's problems are real, but they're not going to mean much to anyone else. And when you've got a character and story that are true but unrelatable, all the craft in the world isn't going to help.:::0:::6/10
En principio atractiva e interesante, finalmente resulta previsible y carente de emocion, y perdiendo ante la inevitable comparacion con Perdidos en Tokio (la mejor pelicula de Sofia Coppola hasta la fecha, con la que tiene demasiadas cosas en comun).:::0:::2/5
Whether or not the journey from nowhere to the possibility of somewhere is worth taking is going to vary wildly from viewer to viewer.:::1:::3.5/5
A thoughtful and interesting deconstruction and demythologizing of American celebrity:::1:::3/4
Although the film throbs with dissatisfaction and longing for purpose, Somewhere plays as a dryly funny meditation on being adrift in Hollywood.:::1:::B+
Like Coppola's previous films, 'Somewhere' examines the isolation (and cultural dislocation) of privileged public people -- people enclosed within the exposing fishbowl of celebrity and the protective bubble of entitlement.:::1:::3.5/4
A superficial movie about beautiful people, when it needed to be a beautiful film about superficial people. Lacks the magic of Coppola's best movies.:::0:::2/5
Coppola has shamelessly retreated to what worked for her before in Lost in Translation.:::0:::None
Somewhere begins with a fancy sports car driving in circles out in the desert. It's a great-looking machine, but it isn't taking us anywhere. It's a metaphor for the entire movie.:::0:::2.5/4
Coppola packs meaning into small actions or seemingly benign scenes that in any other film would immediately hit the cutting room floor:::1:::3/4
In Somewhere Sofia Coppola meanders into the territory of Michelangelo Antonioni, the Italian director who made ennui into art. She makes ennui into ennui.:::0:::1.5/5
It seems impossible that this heavy-handed, self-serious movie comes from writer-director Sofia Coppola.:::0:::None
Just an expensive-looking sports car driving in circles and going nowhere fast.:::0:::2.5/4
The best movie directors aren't just masters of technical craft: They also are artists capable of showing you the world through their eyes -- of making you see and feel exactly what they do.:::1:::3.5/4
Sofia Coppola's 2003 Lost in Translation was such an unblinking masterpiece -- one of the two or three best films of its entire decade -- that it's a shock to witness the near-worthlessness of Somewhere.:::0:::1.5/4
Time for Coppola to get out of her comfort zone, maybe adapt a novel.:::0:::None
Fame is a vampire: We've heard it before. We don't need to hear it again.:::0:::2/5
Coppola is brilliant at capturing mood: With cinematographer Harris Savides, her languid camera depicts California melancholy. But substance isn't her game.:::0:::None
It's well shot, and Dorff is good enough to make me hope he starts popping up in higher profile fare again.:::1:::7/10
If you have the patience to give yourself over to the measured pace of this film ... it delivers with an impact far beyond what a conventional treatment of the same material could hope to achieve.:::1:::8/10
If you're impressed by the fact that this won the Golden Lion at the Venice film festival, go look up the price of a flight to Venice.:::0:::None
There's no denying Coppola displays great understanding of wealthy ennui in Somewhere. And as a film stylist, she hits some fine grace notes. Still, she and we have been here before, and empty hotel life does have its limits.:::1:::B-
The atmosphere Sofia Coppola creates in her fourth feature is so lovely, it's a shame when it's roiled by the encroachment of plot.:::1:::B+
"Somewhere" is a distinctly European exercise in observational nuance and tonal restraint in which Coppola stretches static images to the breaking point.:::1:::3.5/4
Coppola Gets Too Close by Making a Vapid Picture of Fatherhood That's Too Shallow for any Deep Moments.:::0:::2/5
Clearly Coppola has talent and ideas, and she's also the kind of filmmaker who seems most comfortable imposing a particular aesthetic vision and structure on her work.:::1:::B-
It's about doing things together. The simple act of cooking, eating, lounging, hanging out.:::1:::B
Ultimately, Somewhere may be too static, too minimalist a tale. But there's grace here, in its aching assessment of loneliness, in its examination of connections and family...:::1:::2.5/4
Wow, so showbiz is a drag, and you need the grounding of real relationships to stay sane? Imagine that. And is there anyone really still troubled about the alienation of the wealthy and famous...?:::0:::C-
Coppola applies a delicate touch ... and Dorff seduces with a sensitivity that belies his B-movie resume. By the end, we not only feel for, but are moved by, Johnny Marco.:::1:::None
Coppola's graceful, touching, father-daughter chamber piece feels like -- in the best sense -- a love letter to her father.:::1:::None
The writer-director of "Lost in Translation" and "Marie Antoinette" has made the malaise of the privileged her special turf. Ennui is her milieu. And Coppola has a talent for revealing its existential and cultural dimensions.:::1:::2.5/4
Throughout, Dorff is doggedly credible as an obtuse actor, but the richer performance here is from Fanning, and it might have been a stronger movie told from her character's point of view.:::1:::3/4
Good thing note-perfect performances from all involved tend to offset those negative aspects.:::1:::3.5/5
To comment upon meaninglessness by creating something entirely meaningless yourself is hardly a way to make your point - let alone get people into the theater.:::0:::1/5
Coppola's film is composed of many long, stationary shots in which so little is happening it's as if she's encouraging us to look closer for meaning.:::1:::3/4
There's something mesmerizing and special about "Somewhere," for those willing to wait and let the movie cast its spell.:::1:::3/4
Another "woe is me, I'm famous" wallow.:::0:::1/4
It's the singular achievement of Sofia Coppola's affecting new film that she manages to make us care for a dissolute movie star, his angry ex-wife and their indulged daughter.:::1:::3/4
It's the kind of thing some people will appreciate and embrace, while others will flee in a fit of frustrated boredom. My advice: Stick around.:::1:::4/5
Casting the less-than-charismatic Dorff may bolster Coppola's thesis, but it's dramatically self-defeating. How can we feel for Johnny, when there's no there there?:::0:::None
Coppola compounds her customary fragile rue with newfound austerity and toughness:::1:::None
Tender, dryly witty, and shot with Coppola's typically exquisite eye for colour and detail.:::1:::None
Sometimes empty is just empty.:::0:::C-
That use of gorgeously subtle sound design and perfectly timed credits is a Sofia Coppola signature that she seems to have bettered through simplification in this film.:::1:::3.5/4
An intimate foray inside the emotional life of an adult who realizes they've been focusing for far too long on the wrong priorities in life.:::1:::4/5
It's a welcome respite from many of today's filmmakers who think their films aren't complete without a gazillion quick edits or other visual shenanigans that often cover up storytelling shortcomings. (Parental Review also available):::1:::None
The only question is whether Coppola consciously decided to craft a movie as tedious, vacant, and void of substance as her subject.:::0:::1/4
Coppola is a true filmmaker, and in Somewhere she pierces the Hollywood bubble from the inside.:::1:::B+
Long takes, sparse dialogue and natural performances from the two excellent leads, accumulate to give Somewhere's best moments an entirely observational quality.:::1:::3.5/5
Even if Coppola always remains stuck in this tentative, half-formed mode, she's still more interesting than most of her peers.:::1:::7/10
A distinct sensibility often underlies Coppola's half-baked symbols - a feeling for tone, a knack for timing, and an instinct for the absurd.:::1:::3/4
Minimalist filmmaking makes this a real patience tester.:::0:::C
(A) cosmically overrated, emotionally vacant micro-drama...that unspools as a limp, cynical attempt to replicate the nuance-rich tapestry of her 2003 gem Lost in Translation.:::0:::1/5
Ever wanted to know what it's like to be an actor? Somewhere is the intoxicating answer.:::1:::4/5
The movie is funny in a dryly sardonic way about movie-colony rituals and easy sex, but the funk of a noodling movie star is hardly a revelation of the absurdity of the human condition -- or whatever Coppola was getting at.:::1:::None
Coppola's poor-rich-girl vision is certainly consistent, although you sometimes wonder if she knows that hers is not the universal human condition.:::1:::None
This is Coppola's least fulfilling film but key moments nevertheless linger in the mind long after the credits.:::1:::3/5
Somewhere feels like it&rsquo;s made by the grandchild of Antonioni (and, in an artistic sense, perhaps it is). It&rsquo;ll drive at least half the audience crazy, while the rest will walk out with a light buzz.:::1:::2.5/4
"Don't tell, show" has been the writer's imperative for generations; Coppola takes that edict to its most visual and satisfying extremes.:::1:::None
The movie stands on its own terms as a slow-burning drama of life in a Hollywood purgatory where you can not only check out but leave.:::1:::None
Sofia Coppola is here to remind us that film is an art form, and "Somewhere" is yet another work of art of her own design.:::1:::None
Coppola continues to surprise and amaze with her singular view of the world.:::1:::4.5/5
Much needed social commentary hamstrung by minimalism taken to the point of boredom.:::0:::6/10
Somewhere is a movie for the Sofia Coppola faithful, the ones willing to look through what might seem like myopia to the truth that lies beneath.:::1:::3/5
'Somewhere' goes nowhere. It's an atmospheric, low-key, melancholy rumination on adult responsibility.:::0:::5/10
The nearly silent first half plays like Nanook of the North, only the ladies are wearing a lot less clothes.:::1:::A-
Coppola really believed in the content here, and while she needs to tone down her metaphors and return to more realistic characters, her actors believed in her vision just as much as she did and are able to carry it through.:::1:::80/100
As all this suggests, "Somewhere" is not a major effort, although Dorff and Fanning have an easygoing father-daughter chemistry.:::1:::B+
With filmmaking so understated that it might appear completely static on first glance, this may be Coppola's least accessible work. But it's also her most nuanced, and most rewarding to patient, observant viewing.:::1:::9.1/10
I wasn't satisfied by the ending but I enjoyed the journey.:::1:::A-
For all its wandering, this is a very deliberate, masterful, and ultimately very touching movie.:::1:::5/5
The latest calcified bore by Sofia Coppola is less pretentious than Marie Antoinette but every bit as inertly stupefying as Lost in Translation.:::0:::None
The precise contours of Johnny and Cleo's relationship never emerge from the aesthetic fog.:::0:::None
Elle Fanning is full of energy and truly impresses in a film about the lonely life of celebrity.:::1:::3/5
It's undeniable that Coppola is better at mood than she is at drama. Still, there's a sense of foreboding hovering over the film, an expectation that sooner or later the dream will come to an end.:::1:::4.5/5
Sofia Coppola returns to movie star/hotel/ennui territory in a film nearly as strong as Lost in Translation.:::1:::4.5/5
Light on dialogue and heavy on metaphors.:::0:::None
Somehow, Johnny is fascinating to watch. I hate this guy, but I'm captivated.:::1:::None
Coppola is a filmmaker who fills up a big canvas with small moments.:::1:::10/10
As in Lost in Translation, Coppola keeps an eye out for the broken places. That's when Somewhere is really something.:::1:::3/4
Meaning might creep in around the edges of its designer-ready compositions and purringly hip soundtrack, but they're not the point.:::1:::6/10
A minimalist mood piece and that mood is the melancholy that comes with the realization that you've accomplished very little of real significance and your daily routine is nothing more than varying cycles of self-fulfillment.:::1:::4/5
There once was a time when I couldn't wait for the next Sofia Coppola film. Now, I'm fairly certain I never want to see another one.:::0:::D
Sofia Coppola restores her ever present gaze to the lifestyles of the rich and unfulfilled, and delivers her most poignant work yet in Somewhere.:::1:::4/5
This isn't an artistic effort, it's a vacant lot whose signpost reads: "Space available. Movie can be made here. Or not. Whatever.":::0:::1/4
Sofia Coppola has strayed into an area of pretentiousness that we have rarely seen since the height of the French New Wave.:::0:::1.5/4
"Somewhere," in its odd, detached way, is compelling viewing.:::1:::3/4
"Somewhere" is an undeniably minor film. But if you"re willing to be indulgent, you"ll find surprising pleasures hidden within.:::1:::3/5
It's a film in which doing less on screen is more and doing more is less, and if that sounds kind of Delphic, that suits the situation precisely.:::1:::3.5/5
It's been interesting watching Sofia Coppola turn into an artful filmmaker. Waiting for her to become an exciting storyteller, though, just gets more frustrating.:::0:::2/4
What a flat movie for Coppola to have made four films into her otherwise remarkable directing career.:::0:::2/4
Coppola is a fascinating director. She sees, and we see exactly what she sees.:::1:::4/4
Exquisite, melancholy and formally audacious.:::1:::4.5/5
No better than a mirthless Hollywood hack, Coppola sentimentalizes her family dilemma in order to pose as an artiste. Her navel-gazings are a boutique indie franchise.:::0:::None
There's little dialogue, but a whole lot is said in every frame.:::1:::76/100
All the important things Somewhere has to say it says not with dialogue but with action (or lack thereof). It is a bold, often exasperating, and ultimately surprisingly effective choice. Somewhere is not a movie you think, it is a movie you feel:::1:::8/10
You need to pay attention and work a little more than you do during most movies (if you want to be lazy, check out Yogi Bear).:::1:::3.5/4
What she demonstrates in "Somewhere" is an ability to bottle these moments, to create these tiny little pockets of memory and mood that you can dip into, each one a full sensory experience:::1:::None
As unsympathetic as her characters ought to be, though, damned if the writer-director doesn't manage to hit on some emotional truths nonetheless.:::1:::B-
Coppola's screenplay finds the sympathy in the surreal lifestyle of a rich and famous man.:::1:::3/4
If Somewhere dealt only with a successful actor living in catatonic disillusionment at the state of his life, it might not be so special. But this movie boasts a particularly lovely grace note.:::1:::9/10
Starts slow but steadily builds into a warm and nearly irresistible father-daughter love story.:::1:::4/5
Meticulous yet unrestrained, a tone poem of deep, quiet lyricism and frequent flashes of striking brilliance. That rare motion picture that would stay exactly as is were the liberty be given to change anything about it.:::1:::4/4
What could have been a moving tale of a father and daughter reconnecting instead comes off as an interminably boring and pretentious bit of "inside baseball":::0:::5/10
Too often, [it] rubs our noses in what it means -- and its soooooo all about meaninglessness. Film-school cliches and pretentious tedium don't deliver sharp, spanking-new insights...:::0:::2/5
Somewhere is a perceptive look at celebrity culture even if it sometimes feels more like a collection of scenes, a character piece in search of a larger, overarching story.:::1:::3/4
Somewhere is intrigued by the fantasy life of Hollywood but is ultimately compelled by how that fantasy reacts with the reality of common life:::1:::3.5/5
Those who groan that the writer-director has made another indulgent film about the obscenely privileged have overlooked Coppola's redoubtable gifts at capturing milieu, languor, and exacting details.:::1:::None
Somewhere has strong echoes of Lost In Translation in particular, from the luxury hotels to an encounter with another country's bizarre television, but the style breaks rewardingly with what she's done before.:::1:::B
Dropped on the Hollywood bad boy's doorstep by a suddenly vanishing mom, the forced father-daughter relationship takes stage, demonstrating yet again how inventively creative director/writer Sofia Coppola is.:::1:::4.5/5
It's gorgeous, and gorgeously broken--a movie about lifelines by a person who's drowned.:::1:::4/4
If you hated not knowing what Murray whispered to Johansson at the end of Lost in Translation, you will hate Somewhere. Conversely, if you loved the fact that you don't know what he whispered, you will appreciate the beauty that Somewhere contains.:::1:::3.5/4
Coppola is a filmmaker who ignores all the precepts that define screenwriting as an exercise in three acts. She takes her time, dwells on small moments and sees no need for the climactic effect.:::1:::4/5
...captures a state of mind, a mood, a tone and for a film where 'nothing happens,' it leaves its protagonist in a very different place than where we found him.:::1:::B+
Ersatz Antonioni...The protagonist may be bored with his life, but not as much as we are.:::0:::D-
A small but, in its way, daring picture set largely within the confines of the Chateau Marmont just above Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood.:::1:::3/4
A quiet heartbreaker.:::1:::None
Coppola manages to capture the unique bond - the precious, platonic romance - that can exist between girls and their dads.:::1:::3/4
Perceptive in darkly comic ways, Somewhere is a mood piece, and that mood is 'whatever.':::1:::4/5
Both Dorff and 12-year-old Elle Fanning give lovely, unforced performances. You can feel a tenderness building between them, and also a vast, upwelling reservoir of things they can't or won't talk about.:::1:::None
For all its restraint, slice-of-life naturalism and superb soundtrack, Somewhere is a film and a mood that you can sink into like a deep, comfy sofa.:::1:::None
In its sweet, understated, but deeply meaningful story about making vital connections in an often desperately vacuous world, Sofia Coppola proves that, yes, she might have it all, but she still knows what's important in life.:::1:::None
Somewhere is the closest cinema has come in 2010 to capturing a state of melancholy bliss; you may walk out feeling sad, but there's a sense of warmth that comes afterwards and that's a strange, but harmonious, marriage.:::1:::None
Despite its delicate examination of celebrity culture, the film is a perfect antidote to the 'MTV Generation' attention span and need-it-now turnover of the celeb gossip machine.:::1:::4/5
While the final scenes strike a false note, so much of Somewhere rings true.:::1:::3/4
Somewhere features dead-on-the-inside people looking pensively into their bowls of pasta. Some call this reality, I call it bloody boring.:::0:::2/5
A sumptuously stylish and moderately affecting mood piece.:::1:::B
There's a found-art quality to Somewhere, a sense that Coppola has snuck up on the best moments in the film and captured them with a camera.:::1:::None
for some, [Stephen Dorff's] life wouldn't be a hedonist hell, but heaven.:::0:::2/4
A Hollywood actor and celebrity's close and intimate encounter with his 11-year-old daughter spurs the need for a change in his life.:::1:::3/5
With some success, director Sophie Coppola shows that money does not buy happiness.:::1:::B
A brutal exposition of the nothingness of the lifestyle:::1:::None
Dense, graceful and perceptive:::1:::None
Dorff brings an unlikely charm to a role that, if played by a less sympathetic actor, could have seemed entirely critical.:::1:::None
It's not hard to imagine Coppola as Cleo, the little girl growing up in her father's lavish world, seemingly unaffected, and the preternaturally mature Fanning is a stand-out in the role.:::1:::3/5
The performances are terrific. I just felt she was sort of retreading this celebrity thing a bit.:::1:::3.5/5
I love the way Coppola pushes the boundaries on direction here. The way she holds scenes; the pole dancing scene is held for such a long time and it ends up being pathetic and funny and the ice skating scene is just breathtakingly beautiful.:::1:::4.5/5
It's hard to believe that the filmmaker responsible for such an evocative, smart debut as The Virgin Suicides could create something so dull.:::0:::2/5
In the end, the opening shot of a car doing laps seems unintentionally symbolic of Coppola's career. With Somewhere she seems to be going round in circles.:::0:::2/5
A smug, selfpitying sleepwalk through celebrity culture, it might make her Hollywood pals smirk, but it will likely make you snore.:::0:::2/5
Sofia Coppola's fourth, curiously and unfortunately, seems destined to be quickly forgotten.:::0:::2/5
Coppola knows she's treading water here, but she's smart enough to make that in itself her film's subject, spinning an extra variation, perhaps this one last time, on the adage to work with what you know.:::1:::3/5
Coppola again shows how keen she is to show cosseted young girls and women struggling with their place in the world.:::1:::3/5
As a slow-burn, poetic character piece it works just fine, with Dorff and especially Fanning making engaging leads.:::1:::3/5
Two hours of whimsical nothingness, playing variations on the superior Lost in Translation.:::0:::1/5
It may not have Lost In Translation's reach, but it's original and smartly funny with top performances.:::1:::4/5
The movie unfolds at the same pace as Johnny's languorous life, a slow, seemingly pointless blurring of the days, but one that arrives at a touching moment of self-realisation.:::1:::4/5
Self indulgent, repetitive, ambivalent. Loaded with long pauses and unblinking shots. Perhaps even pretentious. But it's also evocative, hypnotic, wry, moving and, like Lost In Translation, open to interpretation.:::1:::4/5
That the movie is able to make us care is a testament to Coppola's prodigious gifts.:::1:::B+
Stephen Dorff, who at first seems oddly cast, inhabits his role with the swagger of a wolf and the constitution of a sheep.:::1:::3.5/5
We often easily overlook a sweet, unassuming and simple film such as this. Coppola, Dorff and Fanning have given us a beautiful gift; 98 minutes of love, real and true.:::1:::4/5
Perfectly skewers the Hollywood airhead lifestyle.:::1:::4/5
Goes nowhere very, very slowly. Nothing happens. Most dramatic moment? Dorff's character gets stuck in traffic.:::0:::None
Given that Sofia Coppola, a real Hollywood insider, wrote and directed this film, I believe that there is more than a little truth in this unique depiction of Hollywood stardom.:::1:::C+
It held my attention throughout and the film-making was first-class.:::1:::B+
Excruciatingly narcissistic, "Somewhere" is a suspect milieu satire that favors enforced glamour over narrative complexity. This is one of the worst films of 2010.:::0:::F
After the disappointing studio film Marie Antoinette, Coppola is back on terra firma with this intimate tale of father-daughter evolving bond, nicely played by Dorfmaking.:::0:::D-
Simply awful...like a SyFy Network Saturday night special that's inexplicably escaped to the big screen.:::0:::D-
An underwhelming and derivative sci-fi thriller that's only marginally more impressive than a run-of-the-mill SyFy Channel telepic.:::0:::None
It's finally here: The most boring alien-invasion movie ever.:::0:::None
It's like a trip to a Kmart staffed by the ugliest beings imaginable.:::0:::1.5/4
For a movie on a $10 million budget, it delivers more and better bangs for the buck than many blockbusters ten times the price. It's just a shame they couldn't find actors who deliver equal efficiency. Or script doctors, for that matter.:::0:::C
The Strauses used their tech savvy to make a marvel of logistics that looks every bit as slick as a studio tentpole. It's just a shame they haven't figured out a way to CG a decent story. Yet.:::0:::C+
I suppose it's fitting that a movie about aliens extracting human brains would eventually lose its head.:::0:::2/4
More and more frequent attacks by the brain-sucking outer space invaders... don't come so much as frights or thrills as they do a form of relief; as long as the mayhem's going on, we're spared the dialogue.:::0:::2/5
A cut-and-paste monster mash with no business whatever in a multiplex. Heck, if you tuned into this on cable on a Sunday night, you'd be cancelling your subscription.:::0:::1/5
Taken in the spirit in which it's hopefully intended -- a brainless thrill ride -- Skyline is a slick genre piece that entertains for 92 minutes and is forgotten as soon as you walk out of the cinema.:::1:::None
The directors have worked on the SFX in everything from 2012 to Avatar, meaning that once we get outside, things finally get going.:::1:::3/5
"Skyline" plays like an effects guru's resume reel, not a movie.:::0:::1/4
Instead of making the most of its low-budget limitations, Skyline fights against them and goes down in defeat.:::0:::1.5/5
A minor step above a Sy-Fy Original sauteed with the theatrics of a "Melrose Place"-type nighttime soap, Skyline is certainly ambitious and appropriately epic in scale, but also hampered by a plaguing amateurishness in its other aspects.:::0:::2/4
A good example of what can visually be achieved on a tight budget, but an even better example of why filmmaking should be left to filmmakers.:::0:::2/5
Takes an enthusiastic premise of intergalactic war and reduces it to glimpses of chintzy CGI-laden chaos sandwiched between lengthy stretches of tedious, amateurish dramatic filler.:::0:::D
A laughably bad sci-fi mash-up with some above-average special effects.:::0:::None
Delivers all the Saturday night whizz-bang and Sunday morning brain-ripping you could want.:::1:::3/5
We get some watchable flurries of hunt-'em-down suspense between the interminable kvetchings of the human prey, but the only salient reason to see this is the creature design, by those HR Giger-inspired wizards Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr.:::0:::2/5
Once the ace special effects and full-on monster mania take prominence over the soap opera plot, it does become weirdly fascinating.:::1:::3/5
Cliche, cheesy, and boring, Skyline is all blue sheen and no soul.:::0:::1.5/5
It certainly feels that the screenplay, full of cringingly cheesy dialogue and utterly reliant upon the most rote genre machinations, was never anything other than a frustrating annoyance for the Strause siblings.:::0:::None
Compared with the recent spate of sci-fi films such as District 9, Star Trek and most of Roland Emmerich's disaster films, Skyline struggles to live up to its own expectations, bereft as it is of any humour or soul.:::0:::None
:::0:::None
While it appears to be a pretty straightforward story, the actual film gives you more in scares and chills - and more to think about - than you'd expect.:::1:::4.5/5
Who would have thought talent of that calibre would combine to create such a catastrophic stinker.:::0:::0/5
Because of the writers' choice to stay so superficial, we get a sluggishly-paced, forgettable thriller.:::0:::2/4
It's the very special genetic engineering episode of Parenthood that was too hot for TV.:::1:::4/5
Splice ends up being disturbing, but not particularly affecting. The use of the human characters is too uneven to pull off the desired effect.:::1:::6.5/10
"Splice" is one of those movies that just makes you ache, because it almost achieves greatness.:::1:::3/4
If you like to think while you ingest your horror, then this one's for you.:::1:::4/5
Splice is science-fiction/horror at its best, underpinning its daring moments of bodily horror and sexual anxieties with flawed characters to care about and moral issues to wrestle with.:::1:::4.5/5
Like the mutant progeny, Splice is an unsuccessful hybrid: half moral fable, half mad scientist makes monster flick.:::0:::None
By the second half of Splice, the film has devolved into a rather silly, yet distinctly unsettling blob of horror.:::1:::3/5
Splice is most enjoyable when it embraces and revels in its science-experiment-gone-wrong cheeky horror persona.:::1:::None
The dire consequences of meddling with nature haven't been explored quite so well for quite some time as in Vincenzo Natali's Splice.:::1:::None
I love the character of Dren, which is nerd spelt backwards. I loved the relationship between her and her putative parents: Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley.:::1:::3.5/5
The Frankenstein story, a cautionary tale about ambition racing ahead of one's talents, has potential for great pathos and tragedy, Splice opts for far less than that and only partially succeeds.:::0:::3/5
A compelling and intelligent horror film which twists genre conventions to deliver something excitingly new.:::1:::None
Sci-fi horror turns feral in this misguided story about genetic engineering that morphs into more of a monster freak show than a story with genuine thrills:::0:::None
Offers just enough moral and emotional ambiguity to make for an engaging if occasionally icky movie-going experience.:::1:::3/5
Natali [takes] his film down some dark and disturbing paths, and even if you're not overly keen about the destination, you have to commend him for daring to go there.:::1:::3.5/5
Spends three quarters of its running time desperately fighting against being the kind of film you expect it to be, before becoming exactly the kind of film you expect it to be...:::1:::None
It's a shame -- there's a lot of enjoyment to be extracted from Splice, but it remains a Frankenstein's monster of piecemeal storytelling.:::0:::2.5/5
A B-movie science-fiction melodrama that really needed the genius of David Cronenberg to bring it to life.:::0:::2/5
While it doesn't hold back on delivering the odd moment of outlandish gore, it also turns out to be way funnier, freakier and more perverted than its Frankenstein-style story suggests.:::1:::4/5
One of the year's most unusual, imaginative and daring films.:::1:::4/5
Part horror, part drama and part comedy, this is a hybrid, but an enjoyable one.:::1:::3/5
It doesn't go the complete distance, but this is a wholly admirable, refreshingly grown-up science-fiction movie: a Frankenstein with a beating, gene-spliced heart and top-of-the-range performances.:::1:::4/5
This Cronenbergian exploration of the perils of inter-species gene-splicing wrestles with some topical and disturbing ideas, but never quite pins them down.:::1:::3/5
With above average creature effects and a succinct title which neatly bridges medicine and filmmaking techniques alike, teenagers looking for escapism should love it.:::1:::4/5
Fortunately, after all the howling and growling and carnage is done, Splice does remain a very human film.:::1:::3/5
It's refreshing to see a genre movie that credits its audience with a bit of intelligence, and Splice has got a lot going on under the bonnet.:::1:::4/5
As Natali's potent allegory about child-rearing turns deadly, absurdity is, thankfully, just about kept in check through committed performances and the director's deflating of the most risible moments with well-judged levity.:::1:::3/5
Natali's direction and vision is as nuanced as the story's tone, and while the plot beats are familiar to genre fans, Splice manages to evolve the genre to new heights.:::1:::4/5
Hugely entertaining, superbly written sci-fi thriller that manages to be simultaneously scary, moving and darkly funny, thanks to strong direction, great special effects and terrific performances from its three leads.:::1:::4/5
Natali expertly recombines the body horror of a creature feature with the perverse dysfunction of a family tragedy, engendering a freaky new genre hybrid whose monstrosity is (mostly) human.:::1:::None
The film feels like it's descended directly from the early biological horror of David Cronenberg -- and Natali's work doesn't suffer in the comparison:::1:::7.5/10
It's nice to see a genre film try to be smarter than it needs to be, but all we really get is a genre film that's duller than it should have been.:::0:::2/5
In spite of its few shortcomings, the film has much to commend it and its ideas are adeptly fleshed out by an excellent cast.:::1:::None
As an intense and inventive monster movie that doubles as a Bunuelian black comedy about parenthood, Splice would be a rare beast even if it weren't arriving alongside far more conventional summer fare.:::1:::4/5
While it's more than a tad derivative, it's a stylish, and well constructed flick, benefiting enormously from the lead performances from Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley.:::1:::6/10
Splice is aching to creep out the room with its symphony of goopy creatures and psychosexual situations, but the film is perhaps too timid and verbose to truly lunge forward and gleefully disturb.:::0:::None
Barbed and gratifyingly slimy:::1:::None
Scientific credibility issues aside, this creepy sci-fi piece about a lab experiment gone awry is not without merit or surprises, making it flawed but never boring.:::1:::B+
The filmmakers and producers deserve great praise for their ambition and faith in a film that steps outside of the Hollywood comfort zone, even if the product doesn't have the execution to match.:::1:::3/5
...a classic case of two scientists being screwed by their own experiment.:::0:::C-
Be forewarned--after watching it, some might feel dirty upon leaving the theater. And I'm pretty sure that's the point. So, um, good for the fimmmakers!:::0:::C+
A cleverly disguised expose on the challenges of parenthood, with riffs on abortion and the Electra complex thrown in for good measure, Splice is inventive enough that it's a real shame when it falls apart heading into the home stretch.:::0:::2.5/4
Offers the question if children are born and develop in to chaotic monsters, or if their parents and their own insecurities and misery eventually turn them in to such beings...:::1:::None
The perfect synthesis of horror and the horrifically funny. My favorite film experience this year:::1:::None
A [final] turn for the mundane doesn't negate the preceding, metaphorically sturdy B-movie thrills.:::1:::B-
A modern version of "Bride of Frankenstein" making the point that even monsters can feel sexual longing.:::1:::None
Splice undone by mad science.:::0:::2.0/4.0
Stem-cell debate tarted up in monster drag? Nah, Just another Bjork look-alike mutant with oedipal issues:::1:::B-
Here is a fright flick that is completely original, that takes you to uncomfortable places and abandons you there. If you care at all about horror, do not miss Splice under any circumstances.:::1:::3.5/4
This cautionary tale about science without boundaries goes to such lengths to "cross the line" narratively that it leaves the big questions behind.:::0:::1/4
This bit of metaphorical business keeps on giving, for the film presses hard on the well-worn connections between sex and birth, sensual desire and freakish ambition.:::0:::None
a film of ideas, one that demands attention and thought:::1:::3.5/4
A mixture of the intimately known and the wildly unpredictable, this one just is what it is: a total trip.:::1:::8.5/10
It's not quite the subversive cult-movie romp it might have been, but transgenderism, incest and bestiality all at once has to count for something.:::1:::3/5
Shocking, hilarious, and creepy, one of the better horror films of the last decade.:::1:::4/5
Only for adults with open minds and a high tolerance for the 'Ew!' factor, 'Splice' is smart, thought-provoking and grim.:::1:::3/4
So thought-provoking and disturbing that it qualifies as a powerful work and is probably secure as the best horror film of the year.:::1:::4.5/5
... the tension comes from watching Brody and Polley's well-crafted characters come together and splinter apart as they become parents of sorts and their tricky ethical dilemma worsens.:::1:::3/4
Parts of it work magnificently well, parts of it work magnificently well while being incredibly hateful, and parts of it are just plain stupid.:::1:::7/10
A surprisingly good sci-fi adventure made even better by the acting talents of Brody and Polley:::1:::7/10
The film becomes a discomfiting parody of parenting that delivers both the creepiness and the topicality we want from a great horror movie...:::1:::3.5/4
[It's] witty, aware of its own craziness, and disarmingly insightful about the psychology of its characters.:::1:::None
What's so disturbing about this contemporary Frankenstein story is that it might happen - if it hasn't already.:::1:::6/10
The film sadly lacks the fresh originality of Natali's previous films. Natali's film about DNA-splitting seems disappointingly recombinant.:::1:::6/10
It hit me hard and deep. It's a work of sick beauty.:::1:::5/5
When Splice is in full flower, there's something magnificent about it.:::1:::B+
an intelligent horror film that chips away at the emotions and the intellect without compromise and without respite:::1:::5/5
It strives so hard to be more than it is and that is why it ultimately fails. Could have been good if they left the pretensions at the door and went for straight horror. Then the horrible 3rd act could be forgiven.:::0:::D
Splice is just creepy. Creepy creature, creepy scientists, creepy corrupt corporation.:::1:::4/5
Its sensibilities echo those of David Cronenberg, another Canadian who knew how to mix sly humor with queasy body horror.:::1:::B+
Splice is one of those rare creature features where the most menacing beings are the people.:::1:::4/5
Every generation needs a Frankenstein, and this one opens up the Pandora's box of scientists playing God with intelligence and surprises.:::1:::3/4
A must-see for sci-fi and horror nuts, even if Natali throws away a perfectly compelling first two acts in favor of the big 'Oh no they didn't' ending.:::0:::2.5/5
Splice teases us with greatness before settling in as a messy, but never dull, sci-fi thriller:::1:::2.5/4
Simply the best horror movie from a Canadian filmmaker since The Fly.:::1:::4/5
The film isn't good, exactly -- Natali struggles to keep the creepy and goofy elements in balance -- but it's just weird enough to become a cult favorite.:::0:::2.5/4
Splice is a genre picture that, almost without you noticing it, gets under your skin for both creepy crawly and emotional gains.:::1:::B+
A good horror flick always does metaphoric battle with our interior demons, and Splice summons them in impressive numbers.:::1:::3/4
Daring, disturbing and deliciously twisted.:::1:::A
Regardless of the camp factor, you are only laughing because of its stupidity - not because it's so bad that it's good. Halfway through, 'Splice' mutates from tolerable to ridiculous.:::0:::C
What makes Splice morally compelling isn't the bioethics quandaries it raises so much as the way it delves into parenthood.:::1:::3/4
The horror genre needs more films like this one; works made by filmmakers willing to take chances and deliver something to viewers that they would never expect.:::1:::None
An engrossing, if flawed, techno thriller that never quite goes where expected, and that's what makes it such a pleasant surprise.:::1:::2.5/5
It maintains a fun underlying technology, and the monster part does go places most studio films wouldn't dare.:::1:::None
The director balances everything pitch-perfectly, from the performances to the hair-raising sound effects, and all the way down to images of the creepy, snowy woods during the film's tense climax.:::1:::4/5
A sci-fi thriller that starts out fine but then descends into preposterous developments.:::0:::2/5
...uses its premise to raise intriguing questions about the moral implications of scientific progress, without resorting to a simplistic formula about mad scientists and monsters run amok.:::1:::None
A creepy, slick and initially provocative sci-fi thriller that eventually loses steam once its surprises, cleverness and imagination wane midway.:::1:::6.75/10
An enduring lesson one takes from "Splice" is that you should never let the frontiers of human knowledge be pushed by scientists who drive an AMC Gremlin and wear ironic T-shirts.:::1:::2.5/4
... mining horror out of moral quandary rather than mindless slaughter, Splice occasionally achieves a terrible beauty.:::1:::3.5/5
Part "Frankenstein," part "Freaks," the horror film/cautionary tale "Splice" is derivative and disturbing.:::0:::C
It's a bird! It's a platelet! It's a hot bald chick!:::1:::B
Splice" is a hit-or-miss feature that leans slightly on the hit side. It tries to sound important, while titillating its audience.:::1:::2.5/4
...a sci-fi thriller filtered through an art-house lens...:::1:::3/4
The movie keeps raising new issues past the point where you'd think the filmmakers would have run out of them.:::1:::5/5
While it's certainly not for everyone, Splice is the creepiest movie to come out so far this year %u2013 and one of the better ones as well.:::1:::4/5
A thoroughly repulsive science fiction-horror flick that slicks up its B-movie tawdriness with high-gloss production values and two otherwise classy stars.:::0:::0/4
It's a story that's been told several times before... but Natali puts his own twisted spin on the tale that ensures a few surprises along the way.:::1:::3/5
The core strength of this gooey, schizophrenic horror satire is its ability to be simultaneously quite clever and unrepentantly trashy.:::1:::7/10
As creepy and deranged as Don Murphy on an internet discussion board, though always infinitely more lucid, intelligent and entertaining.:::1:::5/5
The cheap thrills are few and far between in Splice, which prides itself on being more of a thinking man's monster mash.:::1:::70/100
The temptation to shock is too much temptation for Natali.:::0:::1/4
Vincenzo Natali has created a film that does not follow the normal Hollywood formula and takes insane risks. Chaneac delivers a phenomenal performance without using dialogue.:::1:::3.5/5
This relentlessly disturbing sci-fi shocker will torment both your stomach and your brain in equal measure.:::1:::3/5
Brody and Polley's performances keep the film grounded in a semblance of reality even when it threatens to go over the top near the end, and director Natali infuses the proceedings with a consistent sense of nail-biting dread.:::1:::3/4
It wants to tour the scarred human psyche, yet the cobbled-together screenplay is silly when it should be spooky, cold when it should boil over and dumb when it should be smart.:::0:::None
If anything, the film's own splicing together of various cinematic genre elements means it ends up like the creature within it -- a hybrid that's fascinating yet ultimately flawed. (Parental Review also Available):::1:::None
Splice is actually very sympathetic to its monster. This sympathy actually works well for the story, though it is abandoned for a messy and cliched finale, complete with a twist you can see coming from a mile away.:::0:::5/10
Playing God and playing house converge...about as gonzo as the multiplex gets.:::1:::3/4
[T]he first summer movie that you'll find yourself talking about -- rather than complaining about -- after the house lights come up.:::1:::4/5
The developments mostly make sense -- a rarity in almost any thriller that eventually goes bananas.:::1:::None
An edge of your seat thriller, "Splice" is a movie that keeps you asking yourself, "can they really do that" while the story unfolds on screen.:::1:::3.5/4
Besides its absorbing ghoulishness, Splice is terrifically smart, rife with topics to debate and discuss. How many studio-released horror pictures of the last several years can attest to that?:::1:::3/4
Clive and Elsa won't be the only ones feeling the pierce of Dren's deadly tail or tale...so will viewers.:::0:::1/5
Too bad Warner Brothers didn't release this film a month earlier - it would have made a hell of a twisted Mother's Day movie.:::1:::B
However somber it gets, it's never truly thought-provoking, and however outrageous it gets, it's still always 20 minutes behind the audience. It's just too dumb to be serious and too slow to be entertaining.:::0:::2/4
Though a stylish thriller with an initially palpable sense of menace and kinky tension, the story takes such ridiculous turns that it ends up undercutting its initial promise.:::0:::None
Two wunderkind geneticists create a new lifeform that's part human, part creepoid. It quickly evolves into something very cool, and so does this creature feature, with a great cast and only a few bumps in the final reel.:::1:::B+
It's hard to care about what's happening, when you don't care about the people it's happening to.:::0:::3/5
The Cronenberg influence here is evident in Mr. Natali's interest in the body and birth and in an initially subdued, near-narcoleptic atmosphere that helps build a nice sense of foreboding.:::1:::4/5
Splice puts the Frankenstein myth into modern terms; why stitch together parts when you can genetically create a whole? A whole what? That's the question this creepy-sexy horror movie wraps your head around.:::1:::A-
Part monster movie and part domestic drama. While the mixture doesn't entirely gel,...it's a cinematic hybrid sufficiently intriguing to merit a visit.:::1:::B-
Before the film devolves into cliche, director and co-writer Vincenzo Natali creates a potent and provocative thriller about gender politics and human impulses that can't be reduced to a science.:::1:::3/4
The movie is ridiculously over the top, inelegant and so defiantly &#8232;crazy&#8232; that it works, reminding you how fun gore and creatures that go bump &#8232;(and&#8232; grind) in the night can be.:::1:::None
The special effects and creature design, as good as they are, don't exceed the acting by Polley, Brody and Chaneac, who make it all seem entirely plausible and emotionally real.:::1:::4/4
Splice is a hybrid that works. It's a smart, slickly paced, well-acted science-fiction cautionary tale-horror movie-psychological drama.:::1:::4/5
The film's deliberately provocative premise is worked out in broad, lurid comic-book strokes, consciously calculated to shock the easily shockable and titillate the peculiar.:::0:::1.5/4
This story, about scientists who create a life form in the laboratory, goes from intriguing to wacky to disturbing with the speed of a car rolling downhill. And the laughter you hear in the theater is the audience's natural response when it does.:::0:::1.5/4
While it's far from perfect, it's a timely and well-considered thriller about the scarier aspects of genetic engineering.:::1:::3/4
Vincenzo Natali may be insane. In the best possible way.:::1:::8/10
The movie feels uncompromised, genuinely transgressive at times, and smart in the ways it entertains.:::1:::None
Splices together the mad-scientist story with a satire of modern marriage and parenting. While the results are mad, brazenly unethical, and occasionally funny, the implications are deeply upsetting.:::1:::3/4
It's certainly not for all tastes, but it's a legitimate horror movie -- it really does raise prickly questions about modern DNA science, and its psychosexual component is anything but gratuitous.:::1:::B+
If it's discouraging -- or at least disorienting -- to see that Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley have signed on to a gnarly work of science-fiction horror, lighten up. They have good taste in schlock.:::1:::3/4
The plot develops in surprising ways, with steadily building dread that doesn't rely on abundant gore or gotcha scares to freak audiences out.:::1:::3.5/5
two thirds of a really interesting movie:::0:::2.5/5
Splice lives up to its title in both the best and worst possible ways.:::0:::1.5/4
Splice transcends the horror genre and the expectations for what a film like this might be. It offers horror at its best: smart, provocative, beautiful, and terrifying.:::1:::None
Shooting with a cool reserve and a steely-blue color palette, Natali keeps the film unsettling by using icky creature effects, but just as often by offering up grotesque caricatures of real-life parenting discomforts...:::1:::B+
The welcome return of one of horror's more underrated filmmakers is marked by one of the most distinctive scientific horror films since Cronenberg made it fashionable during the '80s.:::1:::8/10
More than a decade in the making, Vincenzo Natali's provocative sci-fi/horror tale never quite lives up to the spectacular creepiness of its premise.:::0:::None
A classic cautionary tale that works simultaneously as a thriller, love story, and meditation on what it means to be a scientist in a time in which everything is suddenly possible -- at least in theory.:::1:::3/5
The movie carves out its own psychological terrain, pondering the emotional storms of both childhood and parenthood as relations in the little family grow ever more perverse.:::1:::None
The climax is a pileup of sorts as the movie suddenly becomes an audience-pandering monster-in-the-woods creature feature.:::0:::2.5/4
Less a parenting allegory than a study in people's perverse curiosity about the unknown.:::1:::3.5/5
The mad scientists of Splice make Victor Frankenstein look like a reasonable man.:::1:::3.5/4
Splice is a creepy, well-acted and memorable film -- one that couldn't have been luckier to come out at a time when breakthroughs in genetic engineering and the creation of synthetic life are making news seemingly every week.:::1:::3.5/5
The film, much of which takes place in laboratories or at the couple's isolated farmhouse, doesn't deliver "the usual." I was fine with that -- grateful, in fact. A little queasy in the stomach, but grateful.:::1:::3/4
The script blends human psychology with scientific speculation and has genuine interest until it goes on autopilot with one of the chase scenes Hollywood now permits few films to end without.:::1:::3/4
Despite its relative bravery in choosing not to embrace the Grand Guignol, Splice is a little too hit-or-miss to truly work.:::0:::2.5/4
The creature effects are terrific, but the human protagonists aren't nearly so interesting, and the don't-mess-with-nature message is too hoary to be made interesting with this feeble setup.:::0:::2/4
Morphing as often as the character central to its story, Splice is an unruly mix of science, morality, family dysfunction, horror and finger-down-the-throat gross-out ridiculousness.:::0:::2/5
It's impossible to buy the tight-pants reaction to Dren when the rest of the film is so robotic. The more Natali pushes the sexual nature of the material, the sillier the film becomes.:::0:::C-
With such ambitions, it deserves more than such a rote conclusion.:::0:::2.5/4
Natali has created a menacing landscape and a fresh approach to the monster-maker genre.:::1:::None
What if there were realms in which woman was not meant to meddle? It's not as progressive as it sounds. But you knew that already.:::0:::None
It begins with such promise, a kinky modernist twist on a classical sci-fi morality tale. That it degenerates into conventional, genre horror is all the more disappointing.:::0:::2/4
Director Vincenzo Natali, working with producer Guillermo del Toro, achieves a second-rate -- Canadian -- tone that recalls Gothika and David Cronenberg's early outrages.:::0:::None
The movie doesn't work, but the sets and CGI effects are fascinating, and the actors carry on like they're in some kind of meaningful futuristic experience off and Fanning and seductively shot by ace lenser Harris Savides:::1:::B
A character study of a successful actor leading a meaningless life--with motionless frames reflecting the idleness and ennui of the subject matter.:::1:::3.5/5
full review at Movies for the Masses:::0:::1/5
This is not so much a dramatic narrative as a portrait of an artist as a young(ish) man. It is a story reminding us that stories don't really exist, and not even movie stars in Hollywood are living the fairytale lives we see on screen.:::1:::3/5
Mercifully careful to avoid cliche, balancing the inate 'in-ness' of the whole thing with disarming honesty and delicate restraint.:::1:::None
Coppola again takes an atmospheric look at celebrity that's heavier on internal mood than actual plot. But this film's more intriguing than engaging.:::1:::3.5/5
Impressively directed and sharply observed, this is an enjoyable and engaging drama that features a superb soundtrack and terrific performances from Stephen Dorff and Elle Fanning.:::1:::4/5
Bless Coppola for keeping her camera still, but she goes to the other extreme, of European minimalism. Like Johnny, the movie is an object in stasis.:::0:::None
Coppola's film-making style is detached and low-key.:::1:::4/5
Stylish, perceptive and often amusing.:::1:::3/5
Dorff and Fanning play naturally and well -- Coppola gives them every chance.:::1:::4/5
Despite its subject, Coppola seems to be exercising more of her European than American sensibility in the small-scale intimacy of this portrait.:::1:::None
:::0:::None
Stone is a flawed film, largely because Lucetta is a B-movie seductress preying on believable human beings with backgrounds and complicated hearts.:::1:::C+
A prisoner and parole officer grapple with sins and the need for redemption in this subtle drama of parallel lives.:::1:::None
It's got something to say. What that something is, though -- besides a four character study in spiritual decay -- is sort of up to you.:::1:::3/5
Stone is an unusual film which shifts uneasily between sleaze and philosophy, but it's distinguished at all times by three luminous performances.:::1:::3/5
Great performances from the cast in this engrossing drama.:::1:::4/5
Stone ultimately feels more confounding rather than profound, (but) it will have you thinking after its credits have rolled.:::1:::2/5
An engrossing drama about the difficulty people have believing in forgiveness or in turning one's life around.:::1:::3/5
Dark and disturbing, this drama holds our interest due to the strong acting and provocative issues swirling around in the story. But it's a little heavy-handed in its desire to convey something important.:::1:::3/5
This film has the kind of suspense where you know something bad is going to happen, but instead of just getting it over with, the film drags it out way too long.:::0:::C
Seems as weary as the Detroit parole caseworker Robert De Niro plays.:::0:::C+
When did Robert De Niro stop trying? When did he start coasting on his well-deserved reputation, either mocking it in crass comedies or sleepwalking through dramas where fans filled in the missing emotions for him?:::0:::2/4
Set up as a familiar noir plot, the film veers off into unexpected places, keeping the audience guessing as to the main characters' motivations well after the credits roll.:::1:::3/4
Like a celluloid 'American Gothic,''Stone' does not paint a pretty picture.:::1:::None
There's an obvious difference between elegant underplaying and merely going through the motions, and while, say, Michael Caine still excels at the former, De Niro has sadly become a master of the latter.:::0:::1.5/4
Stone is a movie about fragile souls. About how fragile we all are.:::0:::B-
With its excess of blatant symbolism and illogical character turns, what could have been a halfway decent exploration of personal ethics turns into a half-assed excuse for entertainment.:::0:::2/5
Watching these three actors burrow like ticks into the underbelly of John Curran's murky moral drama should be enough of a reason to recommend Stone, and it almost is.:::1:::3/5
A 'serious' intent and an ill-fitting hilljack argot reduce Stone to a pebble of a fil:::0:::C-
If only one character in Stone reacted as someone in his position would to the preposterous situation at hand, the movie would be 15 minutes long.:::0:::D
Superbly crafted, smartly acted, suspense-filled noir thriller about compromised ethics.:::1:::7/10
Freedom, though, as a concept is at the heart of some very sophisticated theology that makes up this literate drama:::1:::5/5
A lot of talent goes to waste in this repulsive movie directed by John Curran. This mishmash of profanity, kinky sex and religious babble should have gone straight to DVD.:::0:::1.5/4
There are momentary flashes of dramatic power here, but ultimately "Stone" runs aground on its unfulfilled ambitions, which are both lofty and maddeningly vague.:::0:::2/4
A disconcerting and challenging film. It leaves you wondering. How cool is that?:::1:::B
You can feel the movie's gears grinding throughout, first in the rote suspense mechanics and later in the ham-fisted religiosity (conveyed through an endless soundtrack of evangelistic talk radio).:::0:::None
Mostly this is a tense, portentous, and provocative piece.:::1:::3.5/5
Angus MacLachlan's script never convinces, and John Curran's direction lacks energy.:::0:::2/5
...screenwriter Angus MacLachlan seems to be trying to rewrite Equus without realizing that: 1) what works on stage does not necessarily work on screen, and 2) it's not the '70s anymore.:::0:::4/10
The characters drive it, and they are fascinating.:::1:::3/4
Stone is that rare film that refuses to be easy.:::1:::3.5/5
It's a frustrating, stunted film, dishonest in its intentions and clumsy with its narrative.:::0:::2/5
As in every good dialogue-driven film, talk equals action. The excitement here is sparked by the verbal and gestural give-and-take between the actors.:::1:::3/4
Screenwriter Angus MacLachlan attempts something bold -- broad themes about a society in moral decline -- but he fails to find the story in all that philosophizing.:::0:::2.5/4
An ambiguous film boasting a quartet of mesmerizing performances...:::1:::3/4
The craftsmanship is impeccable as is the acting, but the storytelling is where the movie falls down. And with such a poorly realized narrative, it's hard to be enthusiastic about the many things Stone does right.:::0:::2.5/4
Stone seems to care more about keeping us guessing about what the characters are going to do than it does about making us care what is going to happen to them.:::0:::1.5/4
It's a tour de force for Norton, who fills the air with an intense and yet thoughtful patter about why Stone is in the joint, what he did, what he doesn't want to think about/talk about any more and what he thinks Jack Mabry wants to hear.:::1:::3/4
Echoes of "Cape Fear" reverberate across a withering suspense thriller that pales in comparison.:::0:::C-
Stone isn't the straightforward thriller it appears to be, but the alternative turns out to be dull and lifeless. At least the title is apt: Like a rock, Stone has no pulse.:::0:::2/4
As Lucetta, Jovovich delivers the film's best performance. She is enticing, seductive and a little bit unnerving. However, it's not enough to save this movie.:::0:::None
Worth watching just to see the two heavyweights face off.:::1:::3/5
"Stone" is boring, trite and overacted.:::0:::None
The best reason to see Stone, really, comes from Jovovich, who takes her opportunity to ditch the zombies and square off against the A-listers and absolutely wallops it out of the park.:::1:::None
Stone starts interesting, gets better, and then simply sits there until it ends with a whimper instead of a much-needed bang.:::0:::2/5
Stone is neither high-minded nor low-brow enough. Instead it's stuck in the middle -- in purgatory.:::0:::2.5/5
If you're of a mind that actors as talented as Robert De Niro and Edward Norton could make even pedestrian material watchable, Stone puts your theory to the test. And surprise! They can.:::1:::3/5
Norton, De Niro, Jovovich, Conroy all give performances that are better than the film itself. Save your money in the theaters and rent it when it comes out on DVD.:::0:::2.5/5
Ultimately Stone sags under its own overblown philosophical weight, with a strained and painfully obvious spiritual subtext finally smothering what could have been a simple, effective psychological thriller.:::0:::2/4
Jovovich creates the most captivating, sexy, mindblowing femme fatale you have seen in movies in over 30 years, and can easily teach Megan Fox and Miley Cyrus a thing or two or three.:::1:::3/4
There's enough terrible in this movie to go around.:::0:::1/5
It's the sort of acting virtuoso duet this film, a weak-tea variant of Martin Scorsese's 1992 "Cape Fear" remake with Norton riffing on De Niro's Max Cady, needed a lot more of.:::1:::B-
A meditative, quietly gripping work about people awash in latent unhappiness, coming up from the mud, and slowly pawing their way to a place where they might (or might not) be able to get out of it.:::1:::4.5/5
What compels is De Niro's metamorphosis from bottled-up and angry to confused and, well, angry.:::1:::B-
It presents us with four characters who are fascinating, specific and yet in some way unknowable, not like the usual characters in fiction but rather like people we might meet in life.:::1:::3/4
The movie wouldn't work as well as it does without the impressive support they get from the film's leading ladies, Frances Conroy and Milla Jovovich, who act as catalysts for the explosive drama.:::1:::3/4
What looked like a juicily absurd film noir disguised as a generational acting battle is something closer to a dirge -- a dead-serious meditation on faith and grace, redemption and damnation.:::1:::3/4
You'll admire the performances. But the script's ugly undercurrent will leave you feeling queasy.:::0:::None
Stone could have been some sort of a procedural, a straightforward crime movie, but it's too complex for that. It is actually interested in the minds of these characters, and how they react to a dangerous situation.:::1:::3/4
The performances are the keepers here.:::1:::3/5
Curran sustains suspense and an atmosphere of intensifying menace.:::1:::3/4
As a thespian duel between two heavyweights...has a good deal to recommend it. But in dramatic terms...leaves a lot to be desired.:::0:::C
Stone feels like the product of a committee, not a collaboration, and the resulting aesthetic and thematic incoherence undermines what could have been a precise and even profound character piece.:::0:::6.5/10
...an actor?s film with the story taking a back seat to the thesps.:::0:::C+
Norton is outrageously good in the lead role, laugh out loud funny in Stone's earliest incarnation, gradually evolving into someone quite serious.:::1:::B-
This is a film about people who are lost, and the filmmakers draw a direct line between their characters' existential wanderings and the religious obsessions they find for themselves.:::0:::4/10
Collaborations between Robert De Niro and Edward Norton--one generation's most respected actor paired with another's most affected--seem doomed to be defined by acting with a capital A.:::0:::2/4
Stone is highly charged and vibrant, and pits Edward Norton against Robert De Niro for two utterly electrifying performances.:::1:::3/5
As the movie warms up and settles into place, it becomes clear that there's much more going on here than just actors' egos.:::1:::3.5/4
[It ends] up subverting expectations by denying pleasure.:::0:::2.5/4
A movie steeped in sin that squats awkwardly in a cinematic purgatory between tawdry and talky.:::0:::1.5/4
Moral ambiguity and ethical compromise are at the heart of this meandering prison drama, but at a certain point we simply don't care anymore who is base and baser.:::0:::2/4
full review at Movies for the Masses:::0:::1.5/5
How Curran and his cast chew into it is often mesmerizing.:::1:::3.5/5
De Niro plays a deeply flawed and hypocritical corrections officer with just the right mix of self-righteousness and vulnerability, embodying a man whose soul has withered from decades of corrosion.:::1:::B-
[O]nly the startlingly belligerent honesty of Edward Norton?s portrayal of the title character that makes this worth a look... [S]omething important is missing here: perhaps from the anticlimactic third act...:::0:::None
Genuinely odd in its mixture of bluntness and indirection, screenwriter Angus MacLachlan's study in biblical temptation is saved from its own heavy-handedness by a fine quartet of actors.:::1:::3/4
A stunner - a film that seems to be one thing but turns out to be quite another. It challenges your assumptions at every turn and leaves you wrung out at the end.:::1:::None
Curran offers an affecting portrait of a world gone awry, with morality thrown into question and conventions torn apart.:::1:::3.5/4
A murky bible belt noir steeped in mystical evangelical voodoo more suited to sci-fi. In which De Niro seems to turn back into Travis Bickle minus his taxi, while Norton finds Jesus, loses his dreadlocks and becomes a self-described tuning fork for God.:::0:::None
[A] hooey-heavy prison-and-faith drama.:::1:::C-
Thick with moral ambiguity, Stone proves to be a character drama that confuses heavy brow-furrowing for an insightful dissection of several ethically slippery individuals.:::0:::None
Mr. De Niro fails to make anything about his miserable character poignant, and Mr. Norton's overwrought intensity borders on hysteria. The desired moral dilemma never arrives.:::0:::1.5/4
The seesaw effect of the characters' clarity and confusion helps Curran & Co.'s unexpected, occasionally heavy-handed fumblings toward examining spiritual emptiness find purchase.:::1:::4/5
At  lasting value.:::0:::None
Natali explores this hoary theme with apt, flippant gravity, updating it with canny hipness, but subjecting it to too many mutations to bring it fully to life.:::1:::3/4
If you've seen Species, you know where this don't-mess-with-Mother-Nature horror show is going, though director-cowriter Vincenzo Natali has a few interesting twists up his sleeve.:::1:::3/5
A moderately nifty creature feature that's warped for warping's sake, filled with characters not likeable enough to make their ultimate fate a tragedy, nor loathsome enough to be darkly funny.:::1:::None
The detailed imagining of Dren's life cycle and Splice's one-upping make the movie mortifyingly fascinating, and its spell lasts right up until the junk heap of a grand finale.:::1:::None
Genre-savvy monster movie approaches Midnight Movie zone without abandoning the mainstream.:::1:::None
Flashy and entertaining, but nothing special...You willingly suspend your disbelief - but you won't be proud of yourself for doing it.:::0:::None
There are certain things you would expect in a story like this, and most of those happen. But then there are other developments that I'm pleased to say my imagination is not demented enough to have conceived.:::1:::B+
Brody and Polley, two intelligent actors (neither associated with the genre) anchor this well-produced sci-fi-horror-thriller, which plays with timely ideas (DNA) and smartly emphasizes the creature's erotic-sexual dimensions.:::1:::B+
What starts out as a promising sci-fi thriller loses precious steam in an underwhelming third act climax seemingly affected by budgetary limits.:::1:::B-
Vincenzo Natali confirms that he has a knack for novelty but scant ability to set off truly heart-wrenching emotional provocation.:::0:::2.5/4
It works best while navigating the territory between emotion and instinct and primal drive...:::1:::None
An erotic sci-fi on acid reproductive romp. With bald bisexual bestiality; possible self-rape; involuntary transsexual gender reassignment; and DNA altered worms named Ginger and Fred, who may actually be George and Fred.:::1:::None
The outstanding creature effects by Howard Berger only get more astonishing as Splice splits into an eerie horror picture, then divides again into something out of Rosemary's Baby.:::1:::A-
A powerfully brazen re-telling of an oft-told tale, but in this case ... it still works alarmingly well.:::1:::4.5/5
Splice went down smooth, with its sleek surfaces, terrific special effects and disturbing sexiness.:::1:::None
Polley and Brody both are terrific as usual, but it's really Delphine Chaneac who shines with an incredible performance as Dren.:::1:::None
The film borrows liberally from horror/sci-fi predecessors and emerges with something weirdly original.:::1:::3/4
Benefiting significantly from the casting of Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley, director Vincenzo Natali's outlandish sci-fier sustains a grotesque and funny fascination throughout its slightly protracted runtime.:::1:::None
Natali's experiment works.:::1:::None
Despite an A-list star and a high-tech plot, the film itself feels like a hybrid of silly science tingler and moral philosophy with a straight-to-video sheen-which is likely where their larger profit margins lie.:::0:::2/5
:::0:::2/5
:::1:::3.5/4
It's charming, enjoyable, and has a heavy dose of that ol' Disney magic.:::1:::3.5/4
can't help liking a movie with chameleon reaction shots.:::1:::None
Even if Disney movies aren't your cup of tea, you'll be surprised at the witty and pleasant approach Tangled exudes.:::1:::8/10
A version of Rapunzel that lets down its hair just enough to deserve a place of honor with all the other glorious Disney "princess" tales.:::1:::3/4
Despite modern-day characterisation and rousing action sequences, the ... pastel colouring hints at the time-honoured simplicity and innocence of Disney's best-loved classics:::1:::4/5
All in all, it's a fun, entertaining, and enjoyable way to spend 90 minutes.:::1:::3/4
A short and sweet fractured fairy tale that succeeds in laughs, love, and sharp animation...:::1:::None
Is it on a par with films such as The Little Mermaid? No, but it's a worthy addition to the lineage:::1:::4/5
Not the best of the most recent Disney upswing, but certainly an entertaining achievement.:::1:::3.5/4
Thoroughly enjoyable.:::1:::3/5
Don't let its princessness put you off - Tangled is Disney recapturing its magic and that fairy-tale sense of wonder that made its films appeal to boys, girls, mums, dads, nanas and pas in a silly yet wonderful way.:::1:::4/5
"Tangled" is a great film that should have been the fourth Oscar nominee for Best Animated feature.:::1:::8/10
Enjoyable movie but a little shallow and lifeless.:::0:::C
Yet another princess story calculated to revive the public's cash-dispensing interest in that kneaded-to-death formula.:::0:::2/5
I approach each new Disney film with a combination of eagerness and apprehension: will it be as good as I want it to be? Can "the new guys" carry the torch lit by Walt and...:::1:::None
Romantic, musical, moving -- and outstandingly funny.:::1:::None
It's a fleet, fun and splendidly realized digital fantasy designed to look like a Disneyland attraction come to life.:::1:::4/5
It's the best Disney animation in years, and a natural counterpoint to the contemporary comic style that has come to dominate the industry.:::1:::B
Disney returns to a successful formula for this enjoyable animated romp based on a Grimm fairy tale. It's bright and funny, but not too snappy, and skips the pop-culture references for a more timeless approach.:::1:::3.5/5
The prettiness comes with brains, and the whole production, like those newly eye-catching models of American-made cars, bespeaks resurgent confidence.:::1:::None
This one's strictly for the youngsters, but that doesn't change the fact that it's a very well-made kid's film.:::1:::7/10
It's Mandy Moore's performance that seals the deal with a charm and personality I didn't know she had--incredibly well rendered by the animation team off her sprightly voice track.:::1:::4/5
For whatever problems it has, though, Tangled is still an enjoyable fairy tale romp with some excellent animation that still takes better advantage of 3D than any post-produced live action film yet.:::1:::7.5/10
This is classic Disney; a reworking of an old fairy tale with a nice little feminist touch of female empowerment.:::1:::8/10
Tangled puts a happy twist on a grim tale.:::1:::4/5
It's Rapunzel's journey to maturity - accompanied by violently see-sawing emotions that the film's teen and tween audience will recognise - which provides the story's core.:::1:::None
After a few too many inferior Pixar-style movies, Disney's 50th animated feature is a CG-rendered return to the all-singing, all-dancing musical fairytales with which the studio made its name.:::1:::3/5
An inventive new spin on a traditional fairytale, if too frothy to rival classic Disney animations like Sleeping Beauty and Aladdin.:::1:::4/5
It's workaday stuff with unremarkable 3D and little mythological resonance.:::0:::None
A classy entry to the Disney canon, it's great to see their 50th animated feature is a solid effort, if not quite destined to become part of the upper echelons of five star Disney classics.:::1:::3.5/5
For the first time in a while, it looks like Disney's cracked the formula without needing to rely on Pixar to figure out the equations.:::1:::3.5/5
The long-tressed heroine is a rather bland and Valley Girlish, her handsome rescuer is a thieving fop, and the wicked stepmother who's kidnapped Rapunzel and imprisoned her in the tower looks quite a lot like Cher.:::0:::3/5
With a spring in its step and a song in its heart, Tangled is undoubtedly one of Disney's most uproariously enjoyable movies in years.:::1:::None
Disney's delightful animated reworking of the Rapunzel fairytale marries a hilarious script with dazzling and colourful visuals.:::1:::None
It's the top songs, stunning 3D visuals including an amazing dam-bursting sequence, funny script and laugh-out-loud physical comedy that make this a hugely enjoyable experience for kids and adults alike.:::1:::4/5
Hugely enjoyable, frequently funny and superbly animated, this is a pleasingly old-fashioned, utterly charming Disney adventure that will appeal to adults and children alike.:::1:::4/5
Despite computer animation, the movie looks lovingly hand-drawn and is somewhat indebted to the French artist Fragonard.:::1:::3/5
It's no Whole New World, but with (mostly) smart lyrics and colourful characters, Disney's back in business.:::1:::3/5
A romance with songs, and none of them thankfully sung by animals.:::1:::3/5
Combines polished storytelling, witty scripting and relatable emotions to create a smart, snappy and sparkling tale with appeal to both kids and adults.:::1:::4/5
It's a traditional Disney animation, sticking firmly to the fairytale genre and not trying to include popular culture references.:::1:::4/5
The Rapunzel story in 3D and digimation.:::1:::3/5
Not just a pretty face; there's meat on its bones and a song in its heart besides. This deserves a place up there with the best of Disney's previous fairy tales.:::1:::4/5
Brisk, witty and entertaining, but far from classic Disney.:::1:::3/5
As well as driving the story, the themes of loyalty and trust also give the script its richest vein of humour.:::1:::4/5
If last year's Princess And The Frog was a toe dipped back in the water of Disney's glory days, then Tangled's a full-on, head-over-heels swan dive.:::1:::5/5
Not quite Disney at its very best, but a fast-moving, witty, heartfelt animated CG 'toon that sees the Mouse House leaping into the new era of animation with some style.:::1:::4/5
The joy is in the animation, with the non-speaking characters, particularly Rapunzel's chameleon pet and dogged palace horse Maximus stealing every scene they are in.:::1:::3/5
... may well be the first in a new line of animated films infusing Disney fairytale storytelling with Pixar know-how (yes, it's that good.):::1:::3.5/4.0
Leave it to Rapunzel's sidekick chameleon, Pascal, to pick up the slack. Someone give this little guy a movie all his own.:::0:::2.5/5
With princesses and romance for the girls, sword-fighting and derring-do for the lads, Tangled ticks boxes for both genders.:::1:::3/5
Tangled serves as a welcome reminder that before Pixar there was another animation house that led the pack; here's hoping that this is the start of a new generation of Disney excellence.:::1:::4/5
Tangled deserves to be popular with family audiences and I have a strong suspicion it will.:::1:::4/5
Disney's latest fairy tale makeover is a sheer delight, a solid-gold piece of family entertainment that hits just about every button you could wave a wand at.:::1:::4.5/5
Rapunzel se une as irmas de titulo sem passar vergonha, ja que surge como uma personagem divertida, interessante e moderna.:::1:::3/5
Something less than a masterpiece, but much closer to it than some of the other recent entries in the Disney catalog. (Yes, you, Chicken Little and Treasure Planet.):::1:::3/4
For 2010, Tangled is on top of my list of broadly entertaining movies that should please most people. Tangled is clever and enchanting, with animated characters who have heart and soul.:::1:::3.0/5
I liked Tangled but I wouldn't consider it in the upper echelon when ranking Disney's best.:::1:::B+
Cool images and zippy performances flattened by lacklustre accessories.:::0:::3/5
Tangled is not only visually splendid, but it's one to get swept away in. This is animation of the highest order. CGI geeks -- miss it and weep.:::1:::None
In recent years, Disney has developed a keen sense of self-parody, choosing more often than not to deliver shimmery idealism with a wink as opposed to the earnestness of old.:::1:::3/4
The Mouse House has slain the two-headed dragon of Snark and Sarcasm, overthrown the Ogre of Unoriginality and stormed the castle of Children's Dreams! O.K., that last one sounds kind of creepy, but fear not, Disney's intentions are pure and just.:::1:::4/5
Adds to the bounty of this year's high quality animated films, and will make the coming awards season jam-packed with difficult choices.:::1:::A-
Tangled is bound to be a hit with its target audience, and will keep parents entertained.:::1:::3.5/4
Disney has always done big spectacle and epic visuals well, and does the same here. But Tangled's complexity works because of its attention to detail and the smaller moments.:::1:::3.5/4
The filmmakers set about having seriously great fun:::1:::None
A fresh, imaginative twist on the age-old fable:::1:::None
Richly drawn with a combination of hand-painted and computer-generated images, Tangled looks as lush as a magical kingdom fantasy should.:::1:::A-
Although this hair-raising animated tale is called 'Tangled,' it's really a cleverly marketed fairy tale that, at its core, has the foundation of the Rapunzel story.:::1:::3.5/4
I thought this is classic Disney.:::1:::4/5
An entertaining movie that does its job well, yet its polish simultaneously gives it strength and limits it.:::1:::7/10
Tangled a return to Disney's roots.:::1:::3.0/4.0
Sure, we all know how it's going to end, but with Disney finding their classic groove again, who honestly cares?:::1:::4.5/5
If anything, Tangled is hommepowerment -- one more step forward in Disney's slow march to treat male suitors like equals:::1:::C+
... meshes the crackerjack gleam of 3-D CGI with the plush warmth of classic pen-and-ink animation.:::1:::4/5
There are no unnecessary pop references here, just fluid, graceful storytelling.:::1:::None
the mixing of the old and the new gives Tangled a pleasant sense of nostalgia that wears well with its modern tweaks and is a welcome respite from Disney's more desperate attempts to compete with Pixar and DreamWorks in duds like Chicken Little:::1:::3/4
As Disney animated features go, Tangled is middling:::0:::C+
A total delight that should please fans of classic Disney storytelling no matter what demographic they're in.:::1:::4/4
I certainly came out of Tangled in a better frame of mind than I did Disney's The Princess and the Frog last year at about this same time.:::1:::4/5
Tangled proves that sincerity in animated films did not die with the advent of Shrek.:::1:::3/4
Utterly charming, visually sumptuous and often witty, this new 3D musical rendition of the old fairy tale...will delight youngsters and teens while holding the attention of the more hair-challenged among audiences.:::1:::None
The artwork and 3D animation on this film are superb. It is filled with bright imagery and glorious colors in the grand tradition of Disney animation.:::1:::B+
An almost perfect Disney family film with Donna Murphy being the standout star.:::1:::8/10
For perhaps the first time, a Disney fairy tale has adjusted -- downsized -- itself to the expectations of the marketplace. It doesn't want to surprise or innovate but to be a sort of 'Shrek' spin-off; it lacks what a publicist might call 'Disney magic.':::1:::3/4
This Rapunzel's got sand.:::1:::None
This is a testament to the power of 3D when mastered--and not rushed. "Tangled" is animation at its best and it's this season's biggest surprise--it treats its audience with intelligence while giving them a jolt of fun.:::1:::A-
After a slow start, it has just enough Disney charm to entertain the children (of course) as well as the parents.:::1:::7/10
Hilarious, heartwarming and loads of action-packed fun, Tangled isn't just a return to form or the best "Princess film" since Beauty and the Beast; Tangled takes a high place amongst the jewels in the Disney crown.:::1:::5/5
This rendition of the Brothers Grimm's Rapunzel is a fun and clever contemporization of Disney's storied tradition.:::1:::None
This one's no classic-in-the-making, but it's certain to remain one of the season's best bets for family entertainment, with a pleasing mix of music, mirth and oddball supporting characters.:::1:::3/4
The leading candidate for best family film of the holiday-season, Tangled stands tall among Disney's towering animated classics.:::1:::4/4
Seventy years after Walt Disney first sent Rapunzel's story into development comes Tangled, his empire's 50th animated feature and, since Pixar ushered the studio into the digital age with Toy Story, one of its most rewarding.:::1:::3.5/4
t's not unpleasant. But if a horse and chameleon are more charming than your humans, and the chemistry between the hero and the horse is more interesting than the romance, you've got a problem:::0:::B
...struggles a bit with its setup, but once Rapunzel hits the road it becomes a rambunctious concoction of humor, action and eye-popping visuals.:::1:::B
This is straight-ahead Disney, and none of the creative talent really gets to let their hair down.:::1:::4/5
[Works] because of the enthusiasm and commitment with which it knows that it's a Disney fantasy... An almost unnerving lack of cynical distance pervades every moment.:::1:::8/10
an enchanting mix of action, adventure, romance, and humor animated with pure artistry:::1:::5/5
This isn't some Shrekified attempt at a Disney movie. It's a straightforward fairytale with a princess for little girls to fall in love with, a dashing hero and a wicked witch.:::1:::5/5
Tangled is fine, and it may lure some people into the theater with its digital look and 3D gimmick, but it's probably not going to be anyone's favorite.:::1:::3/4
Disney's spirited re-telling of Rapunzel in 3D animation turns out to be a dazzler.:::1:::3/4
The music might have saved the film but instead, Alan Menken, who once gave us The Little Mermaid, Beauty And The Beast, and Aladdin now gives us a generic score.:::0:::2/5
Hair fetishists, rejoice!:::0:::2/4
For all the girl power messaging in Tangled's marketing campaign, this updated Rapunzel is a fairly terrible role model for little girls.:::0:::1.5/5
The animation is so superb, it's a joy to behold.:::1:::None
It shouldn't be too long before we hear about "Tangled: The Musical" making its New York debut.:::1:::None
It may be CGI, but it looks hand drawn. It's absolutely gorgeous...and who knew Zachary Levi could sing?:::1:::8.5/10
Not to upbraid ... but this tale, though visually top-notch, had more holes than a badly-teased beehive hairdo, needing far more layering in order to properly hold up.:::1:::6.5/10
Long hair hasn't been this much fun since Woodstock.:::1:::3/4
I was pleasantly surprised by the flick that's a return to form for old-fashioned animated storytelling, albeit with some modern twists. (Parental Review also Available):::1:::None
Respectful of Disney tradition, but boasting contemporary touches uniquely its own, Tangled is equal parts class, charm and chutzpah.:::1:::4/5
Tangled is lovely to look at, but if you're not a pre-teen girl, you may be distracted by the split ends.:::0:::2.5/4
This tongue-in-cheek retelling of Rapunzel gradually picks up steam until we're firmly in the grasp of its hip hilarity and sincere romance.:::1:::3/4
Fantastic princess adventure is fun, with great messages.:::1:::5/5
You'll find it hard not to get caught up in Tangled.:::1:::4/5
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, you are lovely to look at it and occasionally charming. But there just ain't much to you beyond the hair.:::0:::2.5/4
The heart of Disney animation lies in song and spectacle, and while none of the musical compositions here are quite at the level of "The Little Mermaid" or "Beauty and the Beast," they are good enough...:::1:::3/4
Tangled, Disney's 50th animated feature, is a splendid tribute to the best moments from decades past but also a thrilling example of what could be the future of animated family entertainment from the studio.:::1:::4/4
Tangled is the best animated film from Disney in the past 15 years.:::1:::A
A solid if not-quite-classic musical version of "Rapunzel"...:::1:::2.5/4
The delightfully witty Tangled is the first animated cartoon released by Walt Disney Pictures that can stand alongside Pixar toons without apology.:::1:::3/4
"Tangled" is a welcome reminder of why we call [Disney] the Magic Kingdom.:::1:::3.5/4
Mixes sassy, traditional, silly and shocking into a movie that has something for everyone.:::1:::3.5/4
Tangled is a serviceable kids' picture and marks a milestone in the history of Disney animation, but it's splitting hairs to characterize it beyond that.:::0:::2.5/5
"Tangled" is consistently enjoyable, and a few scenes that feature glowing, floating, pink-and-orange lanterns are quite pretty, but it's also unmemorable.:::1:::2.5/4
Tangled braids strands of traditional storytelling and a contemporary sensibility with stylish if predictable results.:::1:::3/4
If "Tangled" hasn't morphed into a Broadway show within five years, then Disney isn't as smart as I think it is.:::1:::3.5/4
The whole film is gorgeous in a way few non-Pixar computer-animated films are &#8230; Disney's post-Renaissance growing pains aren't over yet, but they're moving in the right direction.:::1:::B+
A transparent attempt to fill the Disney coffers by repackaging the masses-pleasing formulas that led to the studio's early-'90s resurgence.:::1:::3/5
Just modern enough, sassy without being snarky, fresh and contemporary without any po-mo air quotes.:::1:::B+
Tangled is easily Disney's best traditional animated feature since The Lion King. The film has an old-fashioned feel-unrepentantly sentimental, unashamedly sincere, an unapologetic fairytale-in short, an instant classic.:::1:::9/10
The film isn't particularly inspired, though it's good enough not to embarrass ol' Walt.:::1:::B-
Through use of ingenious story crafting, the fairy tale proves to be what I consider Disney's best film (not including Pixar pics) since Beauty and the Beast, and overall one of their greatest creations.:::1:::A+
A timeless joy. One of this year's happiest surprises.:::1:::3.5/4
Tangled is unusually attuned to the emotional frequencies of mothers and daughters, considering that, like basically every Disney/Pixar feature, its writer (Dan Fogelman) and directors (Nathan Greno and Byron Howard) are a bunch of dudes.:::1:::None
Oddly, there has never been a full length film of the Grimm brothers' Rapunzel until now, and the good news is that the first one is a peach.:::1:::B+
Adventure, ho! And much of it is quite funny, well scripted by screenwriter Dan Fogelman, who previously wrote Bolt and Cars.:::1:::3/4
A Rapunzel retelling could have become just a retread of the studio's past princess tales, but this genuinely charming, chintz-free story does something new: It takes the time to chill out, as its heroine might say.:::1:::4/5
Captures some of the best elements of Disney standards while nimbly integrating the clever pop-culture winks and dazzling technical style that are hallmarks of modern computer-animated features.:::1:::3/4
Yup, this is Disney, all right.:::0:::2/4
I can't think of a cartoon more confident about how to use jump cuts for comedy. Those senses of cleverness and innovation merely underscore how shopworn the rest of this movie is.:::0:::2.5/4
By mixing up and confusing the purpose of cinematic amusement and fairy tales, Tangled is aptly named for the mass misperception of popular entertainment as a mechanism of gimmicks rather than an expression of feelings.:::0:::None
It eventually establishes itself as not just a fleet and engaging cartoon entertainment, but something of a latter-day classic... worthy of consideration alongside... Beauty and the Beast.:::1:::4/5
It's a rambunctious, modern story full of chases, smart banter, big emotions, and palpable darkness.:::1:::B+
A nice reminder that for Disney, sometimes simplicity is the best way to go.:::1:::3/5
[A] deeply affecting journey that is both unusual in its nature and grounded in the authority of folklore, one that slowly matures to a poignance that snuck up on me...:::1:::None
With the caveat that I really dug Tangled, I'm not sure it should have succeeded as well as it does.:::1:::B
this story, no matter how faithfully it skews to the classic tale, no matter what kinds of characters and themes were added to increase its appeal, is wonderfully, infectiously fun for nearly all of its 100 colorful minutes:::1:::4/5
A lively comic twist on the classic 'Rapunzel' fairytale.:::1:::3/5
...somehow in their move from hand-drawn princess tales to newer technology, the film, however enjoyable, seems warmed over.:::1:::B
I don't feel like writing a review of "Tangled." I feel like throwing it a parade.:::1:::4/4
Had Menken stepped up with a better batch of songs, this could have been the new Aladdin, but Tangled isn't that far beneath the cream of Disney's crop as it is.:::1:::3.5/5
Clebrates the studio's classic storytelling history while serving up an exciting modern adventure, full of heart and humor, beautiful computer-generated animation, lots of twists -- and yes, a princess.:::1:::3.5/4
The team at Disney has taken a deep breath and tried to be all things to all animation-loving people. There are some hiccups along the way, but by the end there is success.:::1:::3.5/5
While it is a diverting Disney animation -- the studio's 50th -- it lacks the emotional undercurrents of a movie from the studio's Pixar division.:::1:::3/4
Disney makes maximum effort in "Tangled" to make the venerable fairy tale Rapunzel hip enough for a modern audience. Why, I wonder.:::1:::B
The result is an uncommonly pretty visual experience, especially during a climactic scene when hundreds of lanterns are sent aloft into the night sky. One thousand points of light never looked so fetching.:::1:::None
Disney's new (yet not quite novel), musical (yet not quite memorable), 3-D (yet so what) animated retelling of the Grimm brothers' Rapunzel.:::1:::B
Disney's best non-Pixar effort since the second 'Golden Age' of 1989-92...though the materials may be recycled, the carpentry is better than it's been at the Mouse House in nearly twenty years.:::1:::B+
There is no comparison, obviously, between real actors and figures with egg-sized eyes and lantern jaws, but there's something compelling in the perfection the animators are now capable of bringing to syncopated character work.:::1:::7/10
Visually astonishing - and I have to confess it's thanks in part to the use of 3-D.:::1:::3.5
Put simply, Tangled is exactly what it should be.:::1:::None
The film has the advantage of getting surer and more heartfelt and beautiful as it goes...:::1:::3/4
The same old empowerment lessons and comic-relief animal sidekicks.:::0:::2.5/5
Disney magic gives the feature a satisfying lift, but the ride is rocky, caught between the lights of Broadway and the battering ram comedy tempo of a Looney Tunes production.:::1:::B-
Tangled might not ultimately be a modern Disney classic ... but it's nevertheless a lot of fun, full of humor, adventure, good music and great production values:::1:::3 1/2 stars
A more satisfying showcase of derring-do, sweet romance and musical numbers in-between than we've seen from the Mouse House in quite some time.:::1:::None
The best non-Pixar Disney movie since 1994's The Lion King...:::1:::5/5
The romance doesn't match the visual splendor, but no matter: The lushness is enough.:::1:::None
I actually believe in Walt Disney Animation once again.:::1:::3/4
Despite the need to wear flimsy plastic glasses, watching Tangled reminds one that some brands of storytelling never go out of style, whatever that style may be.:::1:::3/4
Here's just more proof that Disney, Pixar, and DreamWorks have got nothing on the folks at Aardman.:::0:::C-
The film lacks any soul or purpose, much like a Jersey Shore castmember. But unlike a Jersey Shore castmember, it's incapable of punching people in the face at random for your entertainment.:::0:::1.5/4
A wonderful animated feature that salutes theodds with its own lofty and base instincts, Stone ultimately channels neither compellingly.:::0:::None
Stone, like director John Curran's previous work, never peaks in any way that could be conventionally described as satisfying.:::0:::2/4
Not to pigeonhole anyone, but it is hard to imagine the man behind the creative and charming June Bug is also the writer who has delivered the pedestrian and mundane script here.:::0:::None
One of those films that revels in despair and monotony, just another 'bad things happen, people are miserable' piece for actors who want to show how downbeat they can be.:::0:::None
[De Niro] offers up a closed-off and downright bland turn that ensures that the viewer has exceedingly little invested in his character's plight.:::0:::2/4
Stone is thrilling for what we're left to ponder afterwards more than any suspense inherit in the interaction during it.:::1:::None
While Stone may not be a film you'll want to rush out to once it opens in a few weeks, if you want to see a somewhat unconventional thriller, this would make a solid rental.:::1:::None
It's worth the price of admission to see Norton and De Niro sparring across a prison-house desk.:::1:::3/4
It's hard to say which element of this risible drama is sillier - Angus MacLachlan's portentous screenplay, cobbled together from half a dozen of Jim Thompson's lesser potboilers, or Norton's sustained impression of Bubbles from The Wire.:::0:::1/5
Though nearly sabotaged by the ridiculous sexual subplot at its center, this soul-searching drama works best at the character level, couching insights about sin and forgiveness under the guise of conventional genre entertainment.:::1:::None
A thoroughly unconvincing melodrama about a sexual triangle that few viewers are likely to buy.:::0:::None
:::1:::4/5
It's funny how Scott's trademark blurry quick-cutting - once considered so cutting edge - feels so dated now.:::0:::C-
A professionally mounted genre exercise which tries to please both thriller and social drama crowds, and suffers mightily as a result.:::0:::C-
You're so busy enjoying the sound and picture quality that you're inclined to forgive the film's missteps.:::0:::6/10
Thunderous, metallic, ominous, screeching sound effects add to the sensory perception that you're watching a megaton monster barreling toward a dramatic showdown.:::1:::3/5
Veteran directorial fireball-hurler Tony Scott (Deja Vu, Top Gun) messes it up, as usual.:::0:::None
This sort of thing by design devolves into two guys talking on a phone, which if it's got any chance of working requires strong actors to bring their characters to life. Which is probably where Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 succeeds best.:::1:::7/10
A valiant effort, but ultimately Pelham feels like little more than Washington's latest star vehicle, bound for Netflix after a short summer run.:::0:::None
The fourth (and least effective) collaboration between Denzel Washington and Tony Scott...:::1:::2.5/4
In the post 9-11 New York City, it's a patently ludicrous suggestion that four machine-gun toting, sinister looking individuals can walk freely about the most heavily-guarded subway system in the world.:::0:::None
When logic subsides, as alas it does, it is the sheer force of Washington's intensity and Travolta's elan that keeps the film on, ahem, track:::1:::3/5
All restless shots and relentless cuts, ticking clocks and roving maps, a stream of shouting and shooting and speed-ramping and slow-motion and little real excitement.:::0:::None
This is either bad writing, bad direction, bad acting or a combination of the three.:::0:::D+
If the trademark Scott gloss serves as a superficial hook, his also-adept manner of building tension and suspense then keeps one interested.:::1:::3/4
It would be impossible to make a completely dull film of Godey's story, but Scott has succeeded in reducing it to an empty, mechanical spectacle.:::0:::2.5/5
Solid performances can't lift this picture above its own mediocrity, however. The plot is formulaic ... and the ending obvious.:::0:::2.5/4
If you're not feeling too cerebral Tony Scott's action movie set pieces are pretty good -- also silly sometimes -- but they're more than enough to fill in time between the lines of cliched dialogue.:::1:::None
In yet another blander-than-bland remake of a classic film, flash-over-substance specialist Tony Scott takes Joseph Sargent's taut, 1974 action-thriller and processes it through the multiplex mulching machine.:::0:::2/5
There was a reality to [the original film] that I think is missing from this.:::0:::1.5/5
If you've never seen the original, the new Taking of Pelham 123 will probably come across as an okay thriller, but if you have seen the original it's clear evidence as to why the movies aren't as good as they used to be.:::1:::3/5
Mechanical and unspirited, this is just another goddam remake, as they might say in the Big Apple.:::1:::3/5
When all is said and done, The Taking of Pelham 123 is a reliable, if unremarkable thriller that delivers what it must, and doesn't waste a moment doing so.:::1:::3/5
Packed with enough rap music, nauseating camera jerks, speed shifts and freeze frames to almost, so nearly, convince us something interesting is occurring on screen.:::0:::1.5/5
Pelham would've been better served by a handful of Ritalin, or perhaps a director who wouldn't dare sacrifice rollicking suspense to feed his meaningless camera fetishes. Stick with the 1974 version.:::0:::None
Ultimately, this is not a great train-robbery film -- but hey, in the whole scheme of things, it's not a bad one, either.:::1:::3/5
"Bland, overweight, and overpaid actors enact their dumbshow against a backdrop of urban efficiency prettied up for consumer delight.":::0:::None
Stays on track as an entertaining-enough suspense thriller featuring fine performances by Denzel Washington, John Travolta and James Gandolfini.:::1:::3/5
Made with all the sinewy economy and storytelling clarity honed by making lots of high end TV commercials, Tony Scott pumps contempo energy and visual style into this classic good story:::1:::None
It is all about star power and screen charisma with Washington and Travolta making formidable adversaries, whether on screen together or at opposing ends of the microphone.:::1:::None
[It's]a popcorn movie, nothing more and nothing less.:::1:::3/5
I won't lie and say The Taking of Pelham 123 is destined to be a classic, nor does it make a whole lot of sense, but it is goofy fun and does no damage to the original.:::0:::B-
Unlike Sargent, who trusted his story to provide the fireworks, Scott resorts to gimmicks: choppy editing, speeded-up footage that segues inexplicably into slo-mo, and pointless explosions of noise. Sometimes, less really is more.:::0:::2.5/4
All sound and fury, devoid of any relevance or resonance.:::0:::2/5
Scott, a sensationalist who cut his teeth in advertising and still looks upon every minute of a feature film as a TV commercial, hits us from the opening shot with speeded-up film, rapid cutting, flash pans, and rap music.:::0:::None
This is a post-9/11 city: terrorism is suspected, the cops are over-armed and trigger happy. Why they don't shoot Ryder when they could is unexplained.:::1:::3.5/5
Where the movie can't quite deliver is in... some third act choices... that seem to be motivated by the servicing of movie star egos instead of story sense or character reality.:::0:::None
Scott's style, all staccato edits and blurry panic, pays off in a few minor scenes, though it's a pity a sub-plot traffic accident has more impact than the main event.:::0:::2/5
'The Taking of Pelham 123' is not a bad film: it's ponderous and shallow, but always watchable. But what it crucially fails to do, especially in the light of its illustrious predecessor, is justify its own existence.:::0:::2/5
Featuring good work from the dependable Denzel, The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 is hampered by hyper-kinetic visuals from Scott, an over-zealous turn from Travolta and a thoughtless script from Brian Helgeland.:::0:::2/5
The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 is not a disaster by any means. For most of its running time, it's a slick, well-crafted piece of entertainment. But you can't help wondering just how good it might have been in the hands of a less self-advertising director.:::1:::3/5
Head-bangingly hyperactive as ever, action maestro Tony Scott appears to have upped his caffeine intake for this unexpectedly entertaining remake.:::1:::3/5
The 2009 version, perhaps like New York itself, is flashier and far less gritty. The camerawork is busier, the effects are expensive, the colours louder. The soundtrack, a bastard mix of rocky techno and crude drum 'n' bass, recalls a car ad from 1996.:::0:::2/5
Juvenile, hyperactive, obstreperous and obnoxious.:::0:::2/5
Scott does like his bells and whistles, substituting those for real atmosphere and sense of place. Fortunately that's not enough to completely wreck a serviceable thriller.:::1:::3/5
Now that all the summer's blockbusters have shot their load, there could be room in the market for this solidly entertaining thriller remake. But your life would hardly be impoverished if you skipped it.:::1:::3/5
The year's most surprisingly enjoyable pulse-racer.:::1:::3/5
For a good hour, Scott delivers a tense cat-and-mouser. Goes off track when Denzel turns action hero, but his riffing with a sinister Trav is what propels this Pelham.:::1:::3/5
The film thrills like a super-saturated fairground ride, but Scott ducks the question of post -9/11 terror, and fails to deliver on a metaphorical level.:::1:::3/5
It moves along at a decent pace but I'd have liked something more - but what exactly, I can't quite put my finger on.:::1:::6/10
The Taking Of Pelham 123 may not be up there with his best, but it's professional, fast-moving and holds the interest. It will pay a few bills, which is the only reason it exists.:::1:::3/5
Tony Scott has made a film that, for sheer fun and breathless tension, leaves the summer's other actioners parked in the sidings.:::1:::4/5
The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 is a classy updating of the original, strong on pace and atmosphere, with Travolta and Washington making a great doubleact.:::1:::None
Tony Scott's remake of the semi-classic of 1974 begins and ends badly.:::0:::2/5
Despite extensive updates, the plot feels a bit predictable.:::0:::2/5
If you like Scott you can argue that too much is better than too little. This movie has a vision and sticks to it.:::1:::3/5
Compare him with the gang-leader in the 1974 film, played by Robert Shaw as a tight-lipped, ice-cool killer, and Travolta starts to look like a joke.:::0:::1/5
The stage is set for a cat and mouse duel that only becomes increasingly conventional before a finale that just isn't a patch on the clever and inspired ending of the original.:::0:::None
A typical Tony Scott all-style-no-substance production, this combines flashy direction and good performances from its two stars, but it's never a patch on the original film.:::1:::3/5
Tony Scott indulges in his usual flashy pyrotechnics, which almost cover up the gaping craters in the plot.:::1:::3/5
The Taking Of Pelham 123 delivers the kind of barefaced popcorn thrills we're often embarrassed to admit are a good thing.:::1:::4/5
A big dumb lug of an action movie and possibly the best of the summer. It is certainly the best that doesn't involve a spaceship or a wizard. Enjoy the ride.:::1:::3/5
The fact that A-list film-makers such as Scott and Helgeland can't even be bothered to come up with a dumb movie explanation to justify the moronic nature of their work feels symptomatic of the contempt Hollywood increasingly has for its audience.:::0:::2/5
Scott has updated the setting, but, more significantly, he's refashioned things in tone, style and theme, deftly recasting it to fit the standard template of the contemporary Hollywood action film.:::1:::None
Director Tony Scott pushes all the right buttons, crafting a worthy -- and in many ways, a superior -- update.:::1:::3/4
At its best when it's not trying too hard to show how gritty it is.:::1:::B-
In the moment, it all feels very dangerous and urgent and important, but in retrospect it seems almost silly. What is The Taking of Pelham 123 meant to be? Drama? Spoof? It succeeds and fails at both at the same time.:::0:::3/5
A good movie, but don't expect the best thriller of the summer in a flick that's sometimes as eventful as getting stuck between 34th and 42nd Streets on the A train in NYC.:::0:::C+
Because of Scott's reliably indiscriminant overdirection, the film only works in fits and starts:::0:::2.5/4
Ultimately, the film reminds us that human life is precious and worth preserving%u2014and all in a smart summer blockbuster.:::1:::3/4
Nothing if not self-aware, this update of Joseph Sargent's 1974 thriller begins by rearranging the class dynamics.:::0:::None
With his goatee and fake tattoos, it's safe to say you've never seen Travolta quite like this before. He's hardcore, and it works. As for Washington, he infuses this fine thriller with the kind of humanity it needs to ground it.:::1:::B
There's a serviceable thriller somewhere in this remake of the 1974 drama.:::0:::2.5/4
It entertains the way it wants, as shiny, shallow popcorn fun.:::1:::3/5
The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 begins in disarray.... But as undependable as director Tony Scott is, his two leading actors are not going to lose their way.:::1:::2.5/5
Filled with speeded-up camera work, which makes the movie pratically unwatchable for migraine sufferers like me.:::0:::None
Scott has ratcheted back on nearly all of his bad habits.:::1:::6/10
Apparently, the movie needed remaking with Arabic numerals, which is probably as good a reason as any.:::0:::2/5
Like swimming laps in bowl of room-temperature oatmeal.:::0:::None
It's Hollywood at its best in deflecting the audience with gloss so they don't notice the thriller's emptiness.:::0:::C+
Dark humor, great interaction between the characters, and cinematic comments on racism, gender bias and a changing world - it's a great crime picture. I'm talking, of course, about the 1974 version.:::0:::2.5/4
Travolta as the crazy man and Denzel as the every man make this movie a summer treat.:::1:::7/11
Stout performances and Helgeland's screenplay keep "Pelham" grounded.:::1:::3/4
Can a director be arrested for the attempted hijack of our emotions?:::0:::None
Washington demonstrates his really remarkable ability to make us forget he's a movie star and completely believe he's a flawed but noble civil servant.:::1:::None
I was really disappointed by this.:::0:::None
Despite implausible contrivances left and right, the film moves quickly and is entertaining.:::1:::3/5
The interminable final act of Tony Scott's heretofore modestly entertaining thriller turns the modulated cool of a Michael Mann film into a brash, loud Viagra ad. This is the great disappointment of the summer so far.:::0:::2/4
To watch the original Pelham and then to watch the new remake is to witness, irrefutably, the decline of mainstream Hollywood filmmaking.:::0:::1/5
(Director Tony) Scott ... uses the camera like a little boy shouting, "Look at me, look at me," instead of simply telling the story.:::0:::2/4
Good movie ruined by some amazingly bad moments.:::0:::C
The commandeered plot is like the film's train. When you first get on board it just sits on the track. Once the story begins moving, you can predict each stop along the route.:::0:::3/5
Under all the layers of MTV circa 2003 there's a tight, good story that's been barely changed from the original, and there are some good performances trying to poke their way through the ADD editing.:::1:::7/10
Not your average bombs-away summer blockbuster, The Taking of Pelham 123 is goofy but enjoyable, with its stars, notably Travolta's wired performance providing most of the fireworks.:::1:::3/5
Washington and Travolta are both still at the top of their games in this high-octane, attention-deficit adventure as riveting as it is ridiculous.:::1:::3/4
The actors bring such dramatic heft to their archetypal parts that they keep things riveting, even as the movie progresses through very familiar territory.:::1:::3/4
Even the city of New York, the true principal player in this tale, fails to come to life, meaning this film might as well have been set in Chicago or London or any other metropolis with a sprawling subway system.:::0:::2/4
I'm probably not the first to say it's a train wreck. Starts out good enough, shows ability to the 1/2way mark, but the last 30 mins are just a scripting mess.:::0:::0.5/4
the main question that you need to ask yourself in determining whether you'll like The Taking of Pelham 123 is whether you believe that John Travolta can be a badass:::0:::2/5
It's not the most exciting movie I've ever seen, but it is a solid thriller with good performances and a workman-like construction from Tony Scott.:::1:::3/4
your typical middle of the road, summer action/thriller:::1:::6/10
Whereas the original, directed by Joseph Sargent, was essentially a well-oiled B movie, the new incarnation, directed by Tony Scott, is bristling with high-tech gimcrackery and over-the-top camera flourishes.:::1:::B-
Director Tony Scott is smart enough to focus most of the movie where it should be, on Travolta and Washington.:::1:::2.5/4
Surprisingly, in a summer full of action-packed blockbusters, this cracking remake may be the movie to beat for sheer popcorn-chomping thrills.:::1:::3.5/4
Set in a nightmare New York City, the subway hostage thriller batters our nerves like a tom-tom.:::1:::3/4
The film does what a good hostage negotiator does: It distracts us from what's going wrong and pulls us into the story.:::1:::3.5/5
While the original film offers superior thrills, Scott's Pelham functions just fine as diverting entertainment.:::1:::3/5
The new Pelham, although no classic, is a lot of fun if you're in the right mood.:::1:::3/4
We've been waiting too long for a sharp little urban thriller with a couple of tense scenes and one fine, bold performance. Given the time, we'll grab this express train, happily.:::1:::3/4
A moderately admired, moderately durable thriller-with-comedy about the hijacking of a New York City subway train.:::1:::B-
Pelham 1 2 3 ultimately plays as too old-school and low- tech to compete with the summer's other big action films.:::0:::2/4
You don't go to a movie by Tony Scott looking for subtlety and subtext. But give him a good story and Scott delivers.:::1:::3/4
Enough of a pressure cooker -- with sufficient psychological crackle -- to recommend.:::1:::3/5
Pelham simply runs out of track, devolving into a series of bad action movie cliches and meaningless skyscraper footage.:::0:::2/5
Helgeland's story is so formulaic and the characters so stock that we're just sitting there waiting for these guys to perform like circus animals.:::0:::None
Most disappointing is the new film's reluctance to even attempt to match the ingenuity of the original movie's celebrated one-two punch ending.:::0:::2/4
The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 has all the usual virtues of a good action suspense drama.:::1:::3/4
Pelham is not merely a film that may induce seizures in those who are susceptible; it is a film that seems engineered to approximate the experience of a seizure for those who are not.:::0:::None
The film's leading men exceed the action genre's usual requirements, if only briefly.:::0:::2.5/4
It ticks along as efficiently as a new clock. The performances are smooth, the car-crash effects remarkable, the pace never flagging.:::1:::3/4
Is this some statement on what happens to white collar criminals in prison? They come out and interject sodomy jokes when they're trying to be taken seriously? Is this how we should expect Gordon Gekko to be in the Wall Street sequel?:::0:::1.5/4
Travolta as the bad guy unfortunately did not work. I think if Washington & Travolta's roles had been reversed perhaps we would have had fireworks.:::0:::2/5
The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 is a near-perfect summer entertainment thriller that shows good story, good director and good actors trump gaudy special effects any day.:::1:::B
Kinetic director Tony Scott balances his need for speed and flash with fleshed-out drama, making Pelham the best of his recent outings.:::1:::3/4
There are few things in life more pleasant than watching John Travolta enjoy himself on-screen.:::1:::87/100
It feels like Pelham is close to something interesting but never gets there because Scott doesn't give a rip.:::0:::2/4
At first it's exciting, but as the film progresses, that quick-cut, never-stop pacing seems increasingly desperate.:::0:::3/5
Against all odds and better advice, director Tony Scott, screenwriter Brian Helgeland and main protagonists Denzel Washington and John Travolta take a much-loved genre classic and arguably make it better.:::1:::3/4
The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3, an energetic updating of the 1974 mass transit thriller, takes account of how much the character of New York has changed.:::1:::3.5/5
Star chemistry, not director Tony Scott's overheated style, saves The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 from being yet another tired remake.:::1:::2.5/4
Most of the film's energy is generated by flamboyant cinematography and music-video cutting, and much of that energy is false.:::0:::None
You can always count on a Scott, in this case Ridley's little bro Tony, to jangle your nerves.:::1:::3.5/5
Crisp supporting turns by John Turturro (as a hostage negotiator) and James Gandolfini (as the mayor) combine with plenty of vehicular mayhem to make this a superior diversion.:::1:::None
The new players can't generate the grimy elan of the old film.:::0:::2/4
...would probably have been even better if the two stars had switched roles...:::1:::3/5
The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3, is how its predecessor would have turned out had Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor gotten his hands on it and injected it with "more power." (Grunt it with me, Ah-ah-ahh):::1:::3.5/5
'A remake and a hostage picture! Can both the good guys and the bad guys use Sony laptops?' Yes, they can.:::0:::2/4
Like most of Scott's recent films, this one ends in self-indulgent silliness. You end up asking yourself, how do the few fun bits of the film manage to survive in the midst of so much lousy filmmaking?:::0:::None
Overly stylized and not-so-thrilling train ride is ultimately merely average at best and will disappoint fans looking for anything more.:::0:::None
I'm giving it a mild recommendation for its good stretches and appealing characters.:::1:::2.5/4
Remake of '70s thriller is riveting but violent and intense.:::1:::3/5
There's plenty of action, but little to get excited about.:::0:::1/5
Travolta may steal the subway car, but it is Washington who steals the movie.:::1:::B-
It's one helluva thrill ride--more NYC than Six Flags!:::1:::None
If it never feels quite as clever as it thinks it is, so what? It's going to look like freaking Antonioni when Transformers lands in a couple of weeks.:::1:::B-
At best, Tony Scott has directed a mediocre thriller that delivers some decent action sequences.:::1:::3/5
The laughable climax is punctuated with a military-style salute from a police hostage negotiater that is so silly it causes one to wonder whether 'Pelham' is supposed to be a dry-as-sand comedy -- a 'Beat the Devil' for the 'Transformers' era.:::0:::2/4
The middle is cliche and the ending somewhat predictable, but the capable lead cast make it somewhat enjoyable.:::1:::3.5/5
Sometimes it's refreshing to see a movie that is okay with just being okay. With The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3, you get a C-student shoe salesman that rarely dazzles but doesn't disappoint.:::1:::2.5/4
Parental Content Review:::0:::None
Instead of Helgeland pumping energy into the story, it's the external elements that benefit from a modern sensibility, leaving the plot and dialogue to languish on a gummy subway car floor.:::0:::4.5/10
The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 is the ultimate exercise in redundancy, a bullying, almost completely artless film, a superfluous venture in every possible way.:::0:::3/10
The old-school The Taking of Pelham One Two Three takes you by the throat; this new one, well-made as it is, just takes you for granted.:::1:::3/5
A solidly crafted suspense thriller set on a subway train proves the perfect vehicle for two stars at the top of their game.:::1:::4/5
Hire Denzel Washington. He is bound to make any mediocre film better than it should, which is precisely what he does in The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3.:::0:::2/4
...a film that keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.:::1:::3/4
... a focused and refreshingly straightforward thriller that forgoes the usual high tech confusion and contrived high-concept twists so often laid in to surprise audiences.:::1:::None
Like a child with ADD, Tony Scott's too anxious and fidgety to rely on Brian Helgeland's witty and unnerving screenplay for thrills. Nor will he keep faith in the exciting chemistry between his prize mule Denzel Washington and the playful John Travolta.:::1:::3/5
Not a bad way to pass a couple hours, as long as you don't sit too close to the screen and are inured to a steady barrage of loud dialogue that doesn't bother to be clever.:::0:::C+
If you're a fan of Travolta and Denzel you'll probably like The Taking of Pelham 123.:::1:::3.5/5
If you are lucky enough to have seen the earlier classic, it is more than likely that you will find this version is something to be sneezed at after all.:::0:::1/5
...a run of the mill remake with nothing extraordinary except for good performances by Turturo, Gandolfini, Rispoli, Washington, and Travolta.:::1:::7/10
A complete bastardization of everything that was so taut, substantive and memorable in the classic 1974 original.:::0:::1/4
If I had only one word to describe The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3, that word would be - slick.:::1:::B+
After a brisk start, Pelham jumps the tracks.:::0:::2.5/4.0
The new Pelham takes the chilling original premise and modifies it for an era steeped in technology, making for an energetic and engrossing adaptation.:::1:::3/4
This version of the hijacking thriller tale is pretty messy and has all-over-the-map performances and a too-showy directorial style.:::0:::2/4
the worst kind of dreck:::0:::0/4
[Tony] Scott, to his credit, mostly lets the actors do their thing and stays out of their way.:::1:::A-
As Ryder's motives begin to reveal themselves, The Taking of Pelham 123 loses its aura of post-9/11 dread, replaced by a muddled commentary on Wall Street greed in these days of raging financial crises.:::0:::2.5/4
Hiring Tony Scott to direct The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 is like hiring Michael Bay to direct My Dinner With Andre: A colossal mismatch of director and material.:::0:::2/4
It is remarkable how, with all of the advances in technology over the years, a story like this can remain largely unchanged despite a 35 year gap between tellings. By allowing the movie to unfold in real time, Scott enhances the level of suspense.:::1:::3/4
This movie hits you like 600 volts from a sparking third rail. Damn straight it's electrifying.:::1:::3.5/4
There's precious little that's memorable or even exciting about this new, annoying Pelham, which goes off the rails early on and never recovers.:::0:::1/5
Like the subway itself, things move by connections, craziness and clockwork in The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3, a fast and relentless hostage thriller that never stops.:::1:::4/5
Denzel Washington is that valuable paradox, the relatable supernova. [But] it's too bad the movie around him isn't better -- the '74 edition, propelled by David Shire's incredibly badass theme music, kicks the remake's behind all the way to Coney Island.:::0:::None
This sturdy example of straightforward action filmmaking wouldn't merit much interest if not for the acting match-up at its center.:::1:::3.5/5
It's easy to imagine why Pelham's producers wouldn't want Scott's professional but dull picture to be compared with the 1974 classic.:::0:::None
The new Pelham is a solid, suspenseful tale all over again, so long as it stays in the subway tunnels and airless offices of the transit department.:::1:::2.5/4
John Travolta's wildly successful post-comeback crusade to become synonymous with crap continues with The Taking Of Pelham 1 2 3, Tony Scott's bracingly awful remake/desecration of the classic '70s thriller.:::0:::D
A reasonably interesting but curiously routine heist movie that will be appreciated more by new riders than those familiar with the superior 1974 incarnation.:::0:::C
It's entertaining enough to make it worth checking out but ultimately forgettable, unlike Scott and Washington's previous collaborations.:::1:::B
Scott keeps things tense while allowing for the occasional blast of humor.:::1:::None
The only surprise in the new Pelham is that there's nothing to replace the narrative ingenuity of the original. In fact, there's almost no ending at all.:::0:::C
Although diehard fans of the original should stay far, far away from it, the new Pelham provides a level of engagement that puts it a notch or two above today's standard action-movie fare.:::1:::3/5
Updated for 2009, this enthralling subway heist thriller grabs you and never lets go. It's all about greed and money.:::1:::8/10
Director Tony Scott may not suffer from attention-deficit disorder, but he is convinced you do.:::0:::2/4
There's not much wrong with Tony Scott's The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3, except that there's not much really right about it.:::0:::2.5/4
Travolta barks and giggles and screams, as if creating a memorable nemesis was simply a matter of calling more attention to yourself than anyone else.:::0:::1/4
I can think of worse ways to while away a hot, sticky summer afternoon than ducking into the air-conditioned comfort of the multiplex for a couple of hours worth of jacked-up, seat-rattling, subway-heisting action.:::1:::None
all meaningless movie mechanics, nothing more.:::0:::3/5
[A] rollicking tale that unspools in urgent real time... and is jam-packed with literally breathtaking action.:::1:::None
The movie might leave audiences feeling a lot like hostages themselves, at the hands of the director. Who seems to have a bit of a contact high with all the grating noise, grit and funk of runaway trains. Somebody needed to put the brakes on this guy too.:::0:::None
Pelham would've been better served by a handful of Ritalin, or perhaps a director who wouldn't dare sacrifice rollicking suspense to feed his meaningless camera fetishes.:::0:::D
A compact thriller inflated into a big-budget showpiece that casually throws away its own best attributes to pander to an audience with an impaired attention span.:::0:::None
Scott does his best to turn this back-and-forth into an action movie, but it does more to distract from the simple, economical story than enhance it.:::0:::2.5/5
Easily, the best non-animated studio movie of the summer so far, starting with a nearly perfect script by Brian Helgeland.:::1:::None
It's a movie that gives you little to ponder and one that's more easily quoted than felt.:::0:::3/5
Director Tony Scott has built a career out of crafting films that have been unabashedly geared toward the testosterone set. It's hard not to admire the R-rated gusto with which Scott has infused this film. It's actually refreshing, in this sanitized, hope:::0:::59/100
There's fun to be had in Pelham, at least for a while, but nothing more than that.:::1:::3/5
An open-hydrant whoooosh of an action thriller about a hijacked NYC subway train with passengers held as hostages -- a caffeinated update of a 1974 city-on-fire cult classic that cracked wise with a cynical, now nostalgia-inducing, graffiti-era veracity.:::1:::B+
The essential intelligence of the screenplay and two masterful performances at the film's center engage us with the thrill of a magnetic psychological contest.:::1:::4/5
 power of healing and the spirit-lifting miracles of light.:::1:::4/5
With "Tangled," a delightfully fresh spin on "Rapunzel," the entertainment powerhouse delivers its first classic-caliber computer animation outside the Pixar family.:::1:::4.5/5
Vibrant, funny, and oh so sweet, Tangled is rousing family entertainment which belongs in the top tier of Disney's illustrious pantheon of classics.:::1:::4/5
May not break any new ground, but for better and worse, it's the most inoffensive Princess affair to date.:::1:::B-
A clever and shiny and deliriously funny take on the classic princess genre:::1:::4.5/5
No damsel in distress, this savvy, strong, spunky new Disney 3-D princess is adventurous - and awesome!:::1:::10/10
Seeing it once doesn't do this wonderful film justice. Yes, I loved Tangled! Simply put, this is one of the best films of the year!:::1:::5/5
An instant classic, Disney's animated revamp of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale, Rapunzel, has produced a spunky heroine that might just infiltrate the heavily-guarded princess canon.:::1:::4/5
An appropriately commingled sense of classic sentimentality and contemporary, gender-equal romance and adventure meet in Tangled, which underscores the still existent pleasures of traditional storytelling.:::1:::3.5/5
Old-fashioned storytelling barely prevails over sassy contempo attitude.:::1:::None
An old-fashioned Disney fairy tale gussied up in 3D for the holidays.:::1:::None
The tale of Rapunzel gets a cheeky make-over in this gorgeous Disney animation, which combines the studio's traditional hand-drawn look with the sculptural qualities of digital 3D.:::1:::None
:::1:::3/4
No one really turns in a decent acting performance, made worse by the cringeworthy script, which has stretches of awful dialogue that bring the movie down between gore moments:::0:::2/5
Can I say with a straight face that this is a good movie? No. But I will say that I found this direct-to-video sequel more creative and entertaining than the original.:::1:::6/10
A lousy horror film that retreads every scare from the first film with significantly less effectiveness.:::0:::4/10
...a typically underwhelming low-budget sequel...:::0:::2/4
:::0:::None
:::0:::None
It's such a fine line between clever and stupid, and this Spinal Tap-caliber cult item maintains a perfect balance.:::1:::None
Not even the always reliable talents of McKean and Lynch can help pull this comedy out of its ironic slump.:::0:::1.5/5
Gold attempts to show Power as a "Napoleon Dynamite"-like charmer, but Gold's spastic performance induces more cringes than smiles.:::0:::1/4
The film's penchant for dorky nostalgia -- especially '70s and '80s-era music -- quickly becomes irritating. It deserves a real tongue-lashing for trying to re-introduce the inexplicable Mr. Mister hit "Kyrie" into the American consciousness.:::0:::None
Gold places his fond comedy in the '80s with all the cinematic skill of early MTV.:::1:::3.5/5
For all the cheap shots in Gold's script, Adventures of Power views air-drumming with a surprising affection.:::1:::None
The playful plot with go-figure ending is bubbly, and the mechanics of the film are on-point for the most part.:::1:::3/5
The rhythm's off in this goofy tale of an air-drumming underdog.:::0:::None
It's not the rough edges that bother here; it's the desperate attempt to capture Napoleon Dynamite's success by relying on oddball characters and off-the-wall scenarios.:::0:::2/5
Your enjoyment of Adventures of Power will be proportional to your tolerance for the one-joke phenomenon of air drumming.:::0:::2/5
So would-be hip it hurts, Adventures of Power is barely watchable, despite the presence of such pros as Michael McKean and Jane Lynch.:::0:::1/4
Underdog comedy is no Napoleon Dynamite.:::0:::1/5
Forgive the film its Napoleon Dynamite overquirk; a loving god is watching all, genuflected to on bedroom-wall posters and seen in the film's final five minutes -- and if you're not a Rush fan, this is not your movie.:::1:::3/5
The film -- despite some successful goofs and a defiantly dorky Phil Collins tribute -- can't quite win for trying.:::0:::None
Gold's screenplay is a tad too ambitious for its thin comic premise.:::0:::2/4
Writer/director/actor Ari Gold has made a competent student film that would graduate him from any film school with flying colors--that's to say, here is an example of a filmmaker who hasn't yet begun to find his own voice.:::0:::D
With its quirky costume and production design choices, self-indulgent pic gives Wes Anderson haters an easy new target.:::0:::None
A pretty agonizing affair.:::0:::1/5
The Duel drops us into a pool of languid provincial life ( ... ) Kosashvili gets the delicate falling ending of short fiction that is so hard to achieve on screen.:::1:::None
Ryan Gosling is sadly miscast as the villain in this poorly-written drama.:::0:::1.5/5
It's not a glossy crime thriller, it's not a Freudian family study, it's not the tale of a doomed romance. It's a sloppy mishmash of all those things that adds up to nothing at all.:::0:::C-
David (Gosling) finds potential salvation in Katie (Kirsten Dunst), a free spirit so saintlike that she verges on caricature.:::0:::None
Generally interesting but lost in the year-end shuffle:::0:::None
Jarecki never settles on what kind of story he wants to tell with these elements, and despite good performances, "All Good Things" veers awkwardly from love story to tragedy, from true-life mystery to black comedy.:::0:::2.5/4
There's a fascinating story here for a bolder filmmaker, but after so much meandering it's a relief that All Good Things must come to an end.:::0:::2/4
One can't help but think that veteran documentarian Jarecki chose to rework this material as drama to benefit his career, not the story. The result is a disjointed art film that opts for ambiguity over clarity...:::0:::2.5/4
Jarecki knows how to make scenes of boisterous family reunions and quiet moments between lovers engaging: He fares less well, though, when the story takes a dark turn.:::0:::2/4
...a movie suspended between bold novelistic invention and journalistic reserve. Be it demerit or credit, Jarecki is no Truman Capote and All Good Things is no In Cold Blood.:::0:::84/100
Dunst shines brightly and puts on an acting showcase worthy of awards recognition in the supporting actress category. The picture loses its luster when her character disappears.:::1:::2.5/4
All Good Things is curiously underwhelming.:::0:::2.5/4
While the acting is superb and the film worth viewing, in this odd straddle between fact and fiction, the filmmakers miss the chance to bring more fictive power to the tale.:::1:::6/10
It's a heavy, moody film, mimicking in its form something of the mental state of its central character, which is a nifty trick.:::1:::B-
a rather meticulously-detailed period piece that fails almost completely to offer up any human interest in its pursuit of human truth.:::0:::1/4
...little more than 100 minutes of this-then-that storytelling that offers up a possible (even believable) explanation for its unsolved murder-mystery, but leaves the audience wholly unsatisfied with and unmoved by its conclusions.:::0:::C+
It also feels like one man's attempt to try another in the court of cinema, or perhaps correct the course of justice itself.:::0:::2.5/4
Director Andrew Jarecki, who made his name with the documentary Capturing the Friedmans, is less successful at limning family dysfunctionality in the fictional mode.:::0:::C
The unsolved crime turns out to be less mysterious than the mind of the killer, nervily portrayed by Gosling as not evil but unaccountably empty.:::1:::None
It describes a marriage that looks fine at first, but slowly turns into hell. It shows a man who seems pretty normal at first, but who later seems to turn into a psychopathic killer.:::1:::B
Beset with a series of miscalculated dramatic misfires, the film is a melodramatic adaptation of a tabloid-style 20/20 murder-mystery, wearyingly overstuffed with baroque detail in an effort to prop up its legitimacy.:::0:::1.5/5
In his first fictional feature, [Jarecki ] can't decide whether to opt for the open-ended inquiry of a non-fiction film or the resolved storytelling of Hollywood genre movie, so he winds up stranded in between.:::0:::2.5/4
The second half is at once unconventional and straightforward -- the former because of the actual content, the latter in terms of structure in which it's presented.:::0:::2.5/4
Despite another fascinating performance by Gosling,...Andrew Jarecki's picture doesn't meld its mixture of fact, speculation, psychoanalysis and brooding atmosphere into a convincing whole.:::0:::C+
Gosling and co-stars Kirsten Dunst and Frank Langella don't do anything wrong here but the movie is such a mash-up of tones, fiction, and reality that it never comes together into anything coherent.:::0:::2.5/5
Kirsten Dunst is so good here as a woman at a loss to understand who her husband really is, and what the true nature of his family involves.:::1:::3.5/4
If you see only one Ryan Gosling movie this holiday season, make it Andrew Jarecki's "All Good Things.":::1:::B+
Too bad it's not a doc, which might have revealed the secrecy and confusion that led to such a legendary case remaining unsolved.:::0:::3/5
The story is certainly scintillating. ... But Jarecki utilizes courtroom testimony to frame the narrative ... a gimmick that rings disingenuous in the final analysis.:::0:::None
You never feel you can trust that Jarecki knows what he's doing, which becomes even more problematic when the movie asks us to believe its theory about an unsolved crime.:::0:::2/4
"All Good Things" has the eerie power of a nightmare.:::1:::3/4
As excellent as Gosling is - and the actor conveys the stillness of the man as well as the voices screaming in his head - Dunst matches him stride for stride.:::1:::3/4
Fortunately the director has the services of Kirsten Dunst, who delivers a skillfully naturalistic performance as the doomed wife, who by default becomes the movie's emotional focus.:::1:::None

Dunst is not the only person doing quality work in "All Good Things," but she is the only one worth watching.:::0:::2/4
You watch it wanting to scurry off to read accounts of the real thing, rather than being caught up in the filmmaking.:::0:::2.5/4
As fiction, it would be merely dull. But the movie purports to be based on fact, and its amateur psychoanalyzing feels insufficient, intrusive, speculative, self-serving.:::0:::C
beneath the surface are all kinds of questions about power and wealth and the cyclical nature of familial tragedy, and while they break through from time to time, it is never enough to give the film more depth than a TrueTV documentary:::0:::2.5/4
Andrew Jarecki makes the leap from documentary to feature film and his lack of experience in directing actors shows:::0:::C+
Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst are excellent...(The film) is thoroughly engrossing but somewhat frustrating in the end.:::1:::B
Quotidian, emotionless storytelling.:::0:::None
As absorbing and detailed as "All Good Things" is, it never manages to levitate beyond tawdry movie-of-the-week voyeurism.:::0:::2.5/4
All Good Things is a terrible miscalculation, one that should have been, given his history, glaringly obvious to its director. If this film had been made as a traditional documentary, this would likely be a very different review.:::0:::4/10
The performances offer much to admire, while the story fails to provide the chilling intensity it so clearly wants to generate.:::0:::2/4
The script draws insistently obvious psychological connections.:::0:::None
Gosling is given the barest blueprint of a life gone terribly wrong and the actor struggles to make something out of nothing, though he does manage to give the older David an aura of weirdness that is downright creepy.:::0:::2.5/5
It's difficult, ultimately, to discern the point of the movie, other than to comment on how depressing and futile it all is.:::0:::2/5
Ambiguous, ineptly fictionalized psychological thriller that doesn't ring true, leaving the audience emotionally detached and disappointed.:::0:::5/10
A soap opera that stands at a distance from its characters (that distance being the length of a lawyer's briefcase):::0:::C
It devolves into a misshapen flop with no shape to the narrative and no larger truths to be gained.:::0:::2/4
Don't believe this film's title.:::0:::None
...queasy, claustrophobic mood:::1:::6/10
Jarecki's telling of the Robert Durst story flails too far off course, too often, to retain the viewer's good faith.:::0:::6/10
Oscar will not be one of all good things that All Good Things might receive.:::0:::None
There's plenty of information on what (might have) happened, but not much thought given to why.:::0:::4.2/10
It's a pretty picture or would be if the ominous music and camera position didn't seem directed at the man portentously lurking in the background.:::1:::3/5
...a tedious, thoroughly pointless piece of work that boasts few attributes designed to capture the viewer's interest.:::0:::1/4
Jarecki, the wealthy co-founder of Moviefone who directed the acclaimed documentary "Capturing the Friedmans," here presents another memorable portrait of a dysfunctional family over three decades.:::1:::3/4
The film ends up wrestling itself into a corner, though it's saved by a corrosive central performance from Ryan Gosling and a disconcertingly hypnotic feel.:::1:::3.5/5
Although the movie posits a solution to an infamous missing person's case, it does so in a manner that is less than satisfying.:::0:::2.5/4
for all its strong performances and impressive style, no great effort can overcome a story so inextricably tethered to shapeless real-life conspiracy.:::0:::2.5/5
All Good Things throws so many narrative balls in the air that you may struggle to catch up. It's worth the effort. Jarecki is a master of the telling detail.:::1:::3/4
The film is an awkward combination of tragic love story and tawdry tabloidism, elements which may have, as in the case of "Capturing the Friedmans," worked in conjunction in a non-fiction format.:::0:::C+
Proves disappointingly timid.:::0:::C+
Bad things happen, Jarecki says with panache, but he doesn't have much to say about why; he's more interested in the how.:::1:::None
The movie is so poorly directed and choppily edited that it fails as a portrait of obsessive, pathological love and as a murder mystery inspired by some real and creepy events.:::0:::C
Considering the facts of the still-unsolved Robert Durst case, this underwhelming docudrama from Andrew Jarecki should leave more of an impression.:::1:::2.5/4
This feverishly creepy but dramatically miscalculated picture reps an unhappy marriage of murky psychodrama and dubious theorizing.:::0:::None
What we have here is a somewhat higher grade of a Lifetime true-crime picture.:::0:::2.5/5
Things doesn't nail that riveting tone, or any tone for that matter. It grazes along a field of cliches and anemic confrontations, leaving David a bizarrely unchallenged enigma of a man.:::0:::D
You go away slack-jawed with shock and sated with the chilling bedtime-story elements of a great unsolved mystery novel you can't put down.:::1:::3/4
It's a juicy story, though that doesn't excuse Jarecki from fixating above all else on the tabloid-ready twists and pop-psychological turns of Durst's story.:::0:::2/5
The case-history script is ever on-message, but Jarecki ignores the little details that create a credible social reality.:::0:::None
All Good Things is thoroughly engrossing, a roman a clef that chillingly ponders a puzzle and suggests solutions outlandish enough to be stranger than anything Hollywood, on its own, could make up.:::1:::3/4
A believably creepy tale that forces the audience to draw its own conclusions about what did and didn't happen.:::1:::None
Jarecki gets fine performances from all hands.:::1:::None
An unsettling psychological thriller centered on three riveting performances.:::1:::None
The movie never jells.:::0:::None
[Offers] merely tantalizing speculation from afar rather than up-close-and-personal character and thematic insights.:::0:::C
Andrew Jarecki makes the leap to narrative features with a false start.:::0:::C-
It takes more than a little ambiguity and amateur-hour psychoanalysis to make Gosling's cipher the basis of an engaging screen drama.:::0:::2/4
A documentary on the same subject would have alleviated a lot of its problems. With someone of Andrew Jarecki's non-fiction background at the helm, it wouldn't have been tough to do&#151;or a bad idea.:::0:::2/4
A slow, melancholy tale of murder of how it pays to be rich if you want to get away ...a watchable yet thoroughly forgettable piece of work...:::0:::1.5/4
Despite nice elements in this Oscar-nominated Disney feature, the movie was at the time a commercial flop, but deserves to be seen.:::1:::B
I'm not sure there's anyone alive that believes the 1951 film lives up to Lewis Carroll's deathless 1865 novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, but the animated feature remains a perfectly decent slice of kid-friendly surrealism...[Blu-ray]:::1:::3/4
plays as a series of colorful, but uneven setpieces that lack an interesting or emotionally engaging heroine to tie them together:::0:::2/4
Charm and relative simplicity play like a time capsule of animated movies past, which remind us of the Disney products that captivated our grandparents.:::1:::4/5
Surreal Disney classic with wild-card characters.:::1:::4/5
An emotionally chilly exercise... At the same time it is gorgeous indeed, one of the most singular movies in the Disney canon visually.:::1:::8/10
Fifty years on the movie is clearly due a reappraisal. It's colourful, fun and as surreal as Disney is ever likely to get, this isn't as good as the books, but works as a cute introduction to them.:::1:::3/5
An enjoyable if rather pallid rendering of Carroll's classic tale.:::1:::None
The film is dazzling in its use of color and odd shapes and is enhanced by the distinctive voices of Ed Wynn as the Mad Hatter, Sterling Holloway as the Cheshire Cat, Jerry Colonna as the March Hare, and Verna Felton as the Queen of Hearts.:::1:::3.5/4
What's really disappointing is the undistinguished animation: the film looks and plays more like the Disney shorts than the Disney features.:::0:::None
Disney's animated musical adaptation of Lewis Carroll's classic is enjoyable and contains a few twisted touches and slanted visuals.:::1:::None
Walt Disney has gone a long way towards tightening the leisurely, haphazard adventure of Alice in the wonderland of her imagination.:::1:::None
If you are not too particular about the images of Carroll and Tenniel, if you are high on Disney whimsey and if you'll take a somewhat slow, uneven pace, you should find this picture entertaining.:::1:::3.5/5
Lovely animation and trippy story ruined by never-ending, excruciating songs.:::0:::None

The 8-12s will love it, but grown-ups may feel they've seen lots of it before (especially the caribou stampede, a shameless pinch from The Lion King.):::0:::2/5
There's nothing here that Disney hasn't done much better decades ago, and the script is a lame mixture of slapstick and sentiment.:::0:::2/5
Here is a pleasant, undemanding animated family comedy - decent enough, but it feels like a reshuffling of dozens of films you've seen before.:::0:::2/5
Stumbles every time it attempts to rise above the perfunctory, with its tiresome comic-relief geese and bog-standard internecine rivalry in the wolf pack.:::0:::1/5
A poorly written and disappointingly animated adventure that may keep the wee'uns happy for a while but will leave the adults snoozing.:::0:::2/5
Though predictable and routine, Alpha and Omega will be enjoyed by youngsters under eight regardless of whether they see the 3D version.:::1:::3/5
It certainly gives the nippers their slapstick fix. Sadly, the only sense of wonder it will stir in their parents is when it will all end.:::0:::2/5
Aimed squarely at the very young, this cute animation still feels far too rushed to spend any significant time on.:::0:::2/5
The fact this is out in the same week as the fluffy owl movie beggars belief. It doesn't even belong in the same ruddy century.:::0:::1/5
It?s all pretty bland, with uninvolving characters, unfunny comedic relief and weak computer graphics (made even worse by unnecessary 3D effects).:::0:::1.5/4
'Alpha and Omega' enters the crowded marketplace with little to say for itself.:::0:::2/5
'Alpha and Omega' enters the crowded marketplace with little to say for itself.:::0:::2/5
The 3-D angle is the only one I can identify to justify Alpha and Omega not going straight to DVD, but it's a double-edged sword.:::0:::1.5/5
It's worth howling about!:::1:::3/4
Because of the lacklustre rom-com script and flaccid direction - not to mention the terror on kids' faces with the snarling wolves slaughtering stampeding caribou - wait to howl with the DVD.:::0:::4/10
A thrilling adventure full of imagination and humor. It's the best animated film of the season. You don't have to be a kid to enjoy it.:::1:::8.0/10
Lionsgate's entree into 3-D animation ignores the characters' animalistic appeal and, instead, rewrites wolf culture in a lifeless romp.:::0:::None
Alpha and Omega proves that sometimes more is more and less is less for a reason.:::1:::2.5/4

Wolf tale is all about romance, innuendo-filled jokes.:::1:::3/5
We have the litmus test for 3D's ability to squeeze money from a stone.:::0:::2/5
An animated flick that doesn't leave much of an impression. It's even difficult to recall what happened once it's over because it's so slight and sluggish.:::0:::2/5
Alpha and Omega, an unambitious 3-D animation about a couple of young wolves in love, isn't so much howlingly bad as it is howlingly boring.:::0:::1/4
It's an ugly, laughless 3-D cartoon about wolves that is so wussified and stupidified that it'll bore kids and make their adult minders wish they'd done something comparatively interesting, like cleaning the gutters in the rain.:::0:::0.5/4
There is some charm here. But it's one of those flicks where in a week or so, you'll be struggling to remember the title or any of the characters in it. (Parental Review also Available):::0:::None
The story comes off as patchwork, with a climax cribbed from The Lion King and odd musical sequences that seem inspired by &#133;ahem, classic Mariah Carey. It's not quite the vision of love intended.:::0:::2.5/5
Has old-fashioned backgrounds that occasionally achieve a touch of grandeur, but that's about the best that can be said for it.:::0:::2.5/5
The 3D allows for bold, deep shots that swoop over cliffs and waterfalls, but can't distract from the wolves' clottedwith it.:::1:::B

After preliminary special-effects high jinks -- wolves bobsledding a hollow log down a twisty mountain run -- Alpha and Omega kicks into An Important Life Lesson.:::0:::2/4
Alpha and Omega is one of those rarities in the modern era of Hollywood animation: bad.:::0:::1.5/4
Almost totally bereft of surprises.:::0:::C-
... funny, sweet but occasionally befuddling ... it is all perfectly average, nicely animated, appealingly located entertainment ...:::1:::3.5/5
There may be a few questions from the kids on the ride home, but this is an otherwise harmless and mostly forgettable entry into the bulging 3-D animation marketplace.:::0:::2/4
It's always hard not to think of classic Disney as the standard for a film like this. Using that yardstick, Crest Animation/Lionsgate's Alpha and Omega is far from an emotionally rich, fulfilling experience.:::0:::1.5/4
Young viewers might be distracted enough by the log-sledding critters to overlook the movie's lack of wit, but for most, there's nothing here to howl about.:::0:::C
Relentlessly lame and amazingly dull.:::0:::1.5/4
All the dramatic tension of a dial tone.:::0:::C
Directors Anthony Bell and Ben Gluck populate some decent looking scenery with Saturday morning cartoon wolves whose manes look more like Swiffer dusters than fur, then take the few concepts written...and repeat them multiple times.:::0:::C-
Unfortunately, none of these conflicts or predicaments is particularly compelling, and the unevenness of the visuals doesn't help.:::0:::1.5/4
Like an insane cur endlessly chasing its own tail, Alpha and Omega spins inward until it finally implodes:::0:::2/5
[W]oefully misbegotten... [T]he CGI animation -- pointlessly rendered in 3D -- is plastic and cheap.:::0:::None
Someday they'll make an animated movie in which carnivorous animals actually kill and eat their prey; until then, we're stuck with the likes of Alpha and Omega.:::0:::None
A routine of shenanigans and sleepy dramatics, realized through blocky, rigid animation that doesn't feel very special standing in the shadows of industry giants.:::0:::D
If Lionsgate wants to take a bite out of the animated film market dominated by Pixar and Disney, it'll have to do better than this toothless stray.:::0:::2/4
A gentle courtship guide for youngsters, "Alpha and Omega" is a free-spirited animated comedy where acrobatic chase sequences, featuring wild wolves, take center stage.:::1:::B-
Underwhelming in the style of most off-brand CG, Alpha and Omega is livened by pretty Rocky Mountain backdrops and leadened by stock characters and the wolves' weirdly prissy behavior.:::0:::C
As with any movie, this kids' film is only as good as its writing -- the jokes, the cute bits, the heart. And that's where Alpha and Omega comes up short.:::0:::1.5/4
A dog in wolf's clothing, Lionsgate's drab, anthropomorphic animal saga does little more than reconfirm the preeminence of Pixar.:::0:::2/5

Despite some of its one-dimensional characters, this drama captures the sacrifices that people make during periods of unemployment.:::1:::3.5/5
A bit heavy on the cliches, but this sermon will connect with anyone for whom "the new reality" of today's economy hits close to home:::1:::None
It may not be the "feel good movie of the year," but it is a fascinating look at a very prominent and ongoing situation.:::1:::3/4
There are some witty observations, but these, along with the use of natural light, have the effect of bringing a bad situation into starker perspective.:::1:::3/5
The points made are good ones, even if you wish they could work them in a more subtle way. At the very least, it's a hopeful take on a troubling issue, with a genuine belief in old-fashioned Americana values as the key to survival.:::1:::3/5
has a stinging sense of immediacy and a strong sense of narrative momentum that keeps the multiple stories in balance, as well as judiciously managing sympathy for characters who are usually seen as villains during economic hard times:::1:::3/4
Excellent performances and a fine use of detail counterbalance a somewhat weak storyline.:::1:::3/4
...well-executed programmatic melodrama, and there are some scenes that evince real heart, probably because the actors seem naively committed to the project.:::0:::84/100
As an actor's showcase, you're definitely in good company.:::1:::3.5/5
... an engrossing, if uneven, ensemble drama featuring strong performances by Ben Affleck, Tommy Lee Jones and especially Chris Cooper as the most desperate of the trio.:::1:::3/4
The movie seemingly can't decide whose team it's on, salt-of-the-earth blue-collars or the bourgeoisie.:::0:::2.5/5
Takes an unpopular group - upper management! - and humanises their involvement in screwing the world. Quite the achievement, really.:::1:::4

Unemployment is not a naturally cinematic thing. A far-too-neat conclusion notwithstanding, This is a decent exploration of the psychology of what happens when you loose your job.:::1:::3.5/5
A serious, schematic, well-acted film about adjusting to new lifestyles in a changing world...:::1:::None
Gets us on side with a thoughtful, if sentimental, examination of what it takes to find dignity in tough times.:::1:::3/5
This downsizing drama might be a bit downbeat, but it's sharply observant and extremely well-played by an impressive cast:::1:::4/5
A chilling picture of corporate US, where loyalty to employees has been ousted by something called the bottom line.:::1:::3/5
Capitalism has never looked such a cruel mistress and it's refreshing to see the recession's fallout portrayed in such human terms.:::1:::None
Wells, whose first feature this is, knows how to shape a movie but it still seems a little like a superior piece of television, adorned by a posse of very watchable stars.:::1:::3/5
The film stubbornly sticks to its point: that losing your job hurts you and your sense of identity whether you are at the top or the bottom of the ladder.:::1:::3/5
A decent, earnest, well-intentioned picture about white-collar unemployment.:::1:::3/5
Deserves credit for being a well written and seriously conceived ensemble drama about white-collar America and the financial crash.:::1:::3/5
Like Inside Job, this earnest, well-acted drama is wearing its wallet on its sleeve for all to see.:::1:::3/5
The Company Men does a very fine job stressing the financial and personal abyss that can confront somebody whose year of devotion to a company can result in little more than hand shake.:::1:::3/5
For all of its many flaws, anyone who has ever struggled with unemployment will find this to be an incredibly sober work.:::1:::3/5
There will be plenty of good movies about the recession. This isn't one of them.:::0:::2/5
Effectively, it's a history of the effects of deindustrialisation on working-class people, but in this case it's those in the white-collar sector who are the victims.:::1:::4/5
Well-intentioned but ill-gauged...:::0:::2/5
Engaging, well written drama with strong performances from a superb cast, but the absurdly privileged lifestyles of the characters do seem somewhat at odds with the point of the story.:::1:::3/5
Possibly it has a slightly rose-tinted ending, but it does once again skewer the greed factor in so much of corporate antics, to the detriment of many people's lives.:::1:::3.5/5
The Company Men is full of thin slivers of irony that passes for deep thinking.:::0:::2/5
I don't want Wells to invent a Darth Vader like villain to blame this crisis on - besides, those villains already exist in reality - but I certainly don't want him to vindicate the guilty parties.:::0:::2.5/5
It's hard to imagine many hearts (American or otherwise) bleeding on seeing how such over-paid corporate suits are going to cope with the tragedy of having to trade in their second Ferrari...:::0:::2.5/5
A contemporary drama about the enduring financial implications of 2008, the story plays out like a downbeat, old school version of The Social Network.:::1:::3/5
It entertains, it engages, it leaves the brain empty after use.:::0:::2/5
Ultimately, this is one film for which empathy - and thus interest - will be proportional to your salary.:::0:::2/5
It turns out that middle-ranking executives and even some corporate board members have feelings. Who knew?:::1:::3/5

Driven by terrific lead performances, moody cinematography and an insider's feel for details, this is a bruising exploration of a timely subject.:::1:::None
Wells knows how to extract the goods from a great cast, but it's in service of a somewhat mundane story.:::1:::3/5

Ben Affleck does a fine job of playing a man without one in a compulsive cautionary tale for would-be Trumps and Gekkos.:::1:::4/5
It feels like the pilot for a TV series that could be titled White Collar Blues.:::0:::2/4
This is a movie that actually tries to elicit sympathy for Ben Affleck by showing him get all misty-eyed when he has to sell his Porsche.:::0:::2.5/5
It's the kind of movie that rich, disconnected Hollywood filmmakers make about the recession, thinking they're committing some altruistic act of empathy for a nation struggling to pay the mortgage on its second home in Nantucket.:::0:::2/4
Luckily, Bobby's brother-in-law Jack (Kevin Costner), a salt-of-the-earth construction worker, is on hand to remind everyone that it's better to dance with wolves than finagle with stockholders, or something like that.:::0:::2/4
Belongs more in the category of missed opportunity than the successful caustic social commentary it so desperately wants to be.:::0:::C
Ben Affleck is a temporarily inconvenienced salesman forced to part with his Patriots tickets and his Porsche when he loses his six-figure salary. In a show of solidarity, his teenage son sells his Xbox. 'Precious,' this isn't.:::0:::1.5/4

"The Company Men" has its heart someplace worthy. But its head -- not so much.:::0:::C+
The film's real problem is a top-down narrative that turns rich people's troubles into financial melodrama.:::0:::2.5/4
It's not merely the premise of The Company Men that I object to, it's that such acting talent is wasted in such a humorless, stereotypical, moralizing film.:::0:::1/4
The acting across the board is excellent and this group of four Oscar-winning actors substantially elevate the level of the material.:::1:::None
There's also little sense of what these characters were like before reality came crashing down on them.:::0:::2.5/4
Yes, these former company men sigh a lot, occasionally raise their voices, get drunk and throw rocks at corporate HQ, but there's nothing that feels like real rage, nothing that even remotely approximates the spiritual decimation of a termination.:::0:::2/5
A searing portrait of a corporate culture utterly lacking in human values and the people who are rolled over by it. It's an effective drama, even if writer/director John Wells is occasionally a bit heavy-handed with his us-versus-them shtick.:::1:::4/5
This all-too-familiar gloom and doom tale is depressing and feels longer than the 104-minute running time. The acting is top drawer from the powerhouse cast of respected thespians.:::1:::2.5/4
Very rarely does a film so nail the zeitgeist as to qualify as a cultural touchstone. The Company Men comes very close.:::1:::3.5/4
In the wrong hands, "The Company Men" could have slipped into a slop of sentiment, but the movie doesn't go there. This is, first and foremost, a movie about "men," and what, in Wells' eyes, it means to be a man in these difficult times.:::1:::B+
This is a film without spark. The frustrations are real, but they are neither terribly entertaining nor enlightening.:::0:::C
If you're looking for a film that puts a face to some of the least sympathetic victims of the financial crisis The Company Men will happily take your $10. For the rest of us, there's always whatever's on cable. That is, if it hasn't been disconnected.:::0:::D+
Terribly miscalculated on all counts, especially not recognizing its true place as a tearjerker on the Bloomberg channel.:::0:::C-
'Men' is neither as gritty nor as unsentimental as David Mamet's more uncompromising assessment of office politics, 'Glengarry Glen Ross,' but that doesn't mean there is no place for Wells' vision, which has its own resonance.:::1:::3/4
Fine performances by the entire cast highlight this roman a clef about an avaricious corporate tyrant. Unfortunately, it glorifies cruel marital infidelity.:::1:::8/10
Wells' basic directing style is sufficiently attuned to not only the characters, but also to the performers, to make it interesting.:::1:::None
The Company Men may well be the last of Hollywood's Recession Specials, but let's not get our hopes up unreasonably.:::1:::None
It's so well acted and constructed in such a manner it allows viewers the opportunity to absorb the concept of job loss, and more closely sympathize with those affected.:::1:::4/5
Thoughtful, heavy drama about the downsized.:::1:::3/5
If the recession-era movie sounds depressing, you just don't know what Hollywood is capable of.:::0:::76/100

Painful yet well cone depiction of pride going before the fall.:::1:::3/5
Rather than showing us an empathetic portrait of what it's like to live through such a hard time in America, Company Men shows us a series of rich, white men suffering through problems of their own creation.:::0:::5.8/10
Wells' messages on the dehumanizing effect of corporate greed seem more like prosthelytizing than storytelling. Are the points he's making important? Sure, but this movie isn't going to say anything to anyone not already in the choir.:::0:::5/10
The Company Men is an American film that had to get made and should be seen, especially now in the age of greed gone from bad to worse.:::1:::3.5/5
You don't have to be a suit to find much of The Company Men wrenching.:::1:::None
"The Company Men" is a worthwhile outing that takes despair - but also resilience - seriously.:::1:::3/4
The venerated American export that The Company Men most recalls isn't seagoing vessels -- it's hourlong dramatic television shows.:::0:::None
The TV-bred Wells...has written and directed The Company Men without ever coloring outside the lines: it&rsquo;s all a bit too neat and obvious and predictable.:::0:::2.5/4
The Company Men isn't THAT bad, but in a world with so many good movies, there's really not much to recommend here.:::0:::C
Turns out three stories are two too many. The Company Men should have been downsized.:::0:::2/4
One of the most underrated films you will ever see.:::1:::4/4
Attempts to examine a social problem but is weirdly out of touch with it. The film feels simplistic, like a Nickelodeon movie with swearing and dislocated worker seminars.:::0:::1/4
As the man who becomes completely undone by his sudden fall from grace, Cooper is terrifying. Jones reminds us of his long-held position as chairman of the department of cinematic moral outrage.:::1:::B+
This tale smacks viewers with a reality that's hard to imagine paying money to see in a theater. And yet, here we are.:::1:::3/4
This is not a movie of our time so much as it is a movie for our time. It is quite good, but it is, to be entirely truthful, discouraging to the core.:::1:::7/10
Very cut and dry ... That doesn't, though, make the film any less truthful in its observations.:::1:::3/4
It's simple stuff, but the movie's heart is in the right place.:::1:::3/4
eteran TV producer John Wells filters the economic disaster through the eyes of the laid-off, but not even Ben Affleck and Tommy Lee Jones can save this uneven movie.:::0:::C
"Glengarry Glen Ross" and "Office Space" made most of the same points vividly long ago. "The Company Men" is a lovingly prepared dish served cold and stale.:::0:::2.5/4
A serious, thoughtful and often devastating drama about something rarely explored in the movies: the world of work as a place where we go to find out who we are, and what happens when somebody defined by his job loses it.:::1:::3.5/4
Though not blessed with a cinematic eye, Wells is a gifted storyteller who gets nuanced performances from most of his actors.:::1:::3/4
Wells may strain one's sympathy by giving his narrative over to wealthy, white-collar men, but he also acutely renders the shame and frustration of capable, hardworking people suddenly forced to reassess their earning potential and aspirations in life.:::1:::None
Anyone can relate to ideas at work in "The Company Men." When you take a person's job, you take more than an income, you take his identity, his self-respect.:::1:::A-
Consistently silly, occasionally funny but mostly forced.:::0:::None
American movies rarely catch the American male so nakedly powerless and shattered.:::1:::None
As ham-fisted as Wells' dialogue is through much of "The Company Men," the phenomenon he describes is real.:::1:::None
The cast does the heavy lifting here and carries the movie over the predictable bits, exploring the rising panic of families who face the devastation of job loss with disturbing realism.:::1:::3/4
[It's] not a pretty story, of course. But it's a compelling one and, thanks to Wells and a cast that includes Ben Affleck, Tommy Lee Jones and Chris Cooper, an entertaining one.:::1:::4/5
You are always aware of where the story is heading. Still, the film remains relatively entertaining, simply because the scenario hits so close to home, no matter where you work.:::1:::2.5/4
Wells casts a wide but synthetic net. An aura of well-intentioned generica muffles the dramatic impact of "The Company Men"...:::0:::2.5/4
It is... a little on the predictable and rote side.:::0:::2.5/5
Skillfully shows that no one is safe in a floundering company--and that life ultimately boils down to family, friends and what you have to do to support them.:::1:::3.5/5
A good and decent film in a world that rather heartlessly demands more.:::1:::3/4
Works best as an acting exercise for its top-notch cast, which includes the always fascinating Chris Cooper as the film's most complex and ambiguous victim of hard times.:::1:::2.5/4
"The Company Men" offers no great elation or despair. Its world is what it is. We all live in it.:::1:::3/4
A harrowing portrait of contemporary corporate America that hits almost a little too close to home for comfort.:::1:::3/5
Despite being intensely topical, The Company Men is deadly dull.:::0:::2/4
Fulfills every stereotype about Hollywood movies; A smarmy, condescending, moral lecture from rich guys with no clue about real poverty. Do I begrudge the characters their financial success? No. But I'm certainly not going to feel bad when it falls apart.:::0:::None
The ethics of big business and concept of men out of work haunt every frame of the morally in tune recession drama The Company Men.:::1:::4/5
Wells touches on so many problems of the modern workplace, as it's affected by corporate greed and thoughtlessness, that it's almost a wonder The Company Men is as entertaining as it is.:::1:::9/10
Yes, the film's a little didactic as it lays out the issues. But when it comes to the emotional state of those being laid off, of their families and even of those doing the laying off, it gets things right enough to make audiences squirm.:::1:::None
In its solid construction and resistance to the winds of fashion, The Company Men is one edifice that could outlast many an action blockbuster or standard inspirational drama, and maybe the Great Recession itself.:::1:::None
A film that may mean well but doesn't get down to depicting the real suffering that goes with recession.:::0:::C
As an examination of a floundering American economy The Company Men is shallow and one-sided but pretending to be otherwise; as a character study of the individuals caught in the economies effects it is engrossing.:::0:::6/10
The Company Men could well be the poster movie of 2010. Like so many movies this year, it has great possibilities, but ultimately falters and coasts into easy commerciality.:::1:::2.5/5
A solid, intelligent, emotionally satisfying work of Hollywood liberalism.:::1:::None
John Wells gives a notable tyro writing/directing debut with "The Company Men" and he shows a deft hand at marshaling his large cast and complex story.:::1:::B+
Sharply uneven, this well-acted contemporary problem picture has a good beginning, detailing the impact of unemployment on lifestle, identity and masculinity, but the second half is fake and contrived in its message:::1:::B-
Powerful, provocative and poignant, it shrewdly reflects the emotional savagery of the worldwide economic meltdown of the past three years.:::1:::9/10
Wells' film gives a human face to the headlines and a class of people -- corporate executives -- for whom one's not always inclined to feel bad.:::1:::None
This haunting movie hits you hard and right where you live.:::1:::3/4
Each of the main characters is a big symbol - the villain, the ethical moralist, the denier, the corporate ax, the victim - but the cast is first rate.:::1:::B
One can't imagine devastated workers at the bottom of the business food chain expending much sympathy on these guys, but thanks to some admirably understated performances, the picture makes us feel their pain, too.:::1:::None
A well acted bit of drama that showcases that the Hollywood system can still allow for mature work to make it through without compromise or bombast.:::1:::7/10
We haven't seen an end to the real-life drama after two years. Don't insult us by trying to give us one in two hours.:::0:::2/4
Finding catharsis in bleak matters, the picture satisfies with its sincerity, allowing viewers to sympathize and reflect on the nature of job loss through this efficiently directed eulogy for American industry.:::1:::B+

We've gone backwards rather than forwards. To watch a film such as this is to shudder all over again.:::1:::3/5
The film's most sobering fact: any world leader has a maximum of 10 seconds to decide to retaliate in the event of a nuclear attack.:::1:::3/5
The threat of nuclear disaster is clear and present according to this documentary. Yet its argument that Armageddon is right around the corner is as terrifying as milk.:::0:::2/5
The chilling and highly informative film shows how perilously close we are to nuclear catastrophe, either via terrorism, Dr Strangelove-style cock-up or simple accident.:::1:::3/5
Screamingly urgent and contemporary.:::1:::5/5
Countdown to Zero leaves you uneasy enough about the threat from nukes, but also amazed that to date, at least, no blunder has ended in annihilation.:::1:::4/5
This campaigning documentary offers a sobering warning that the possibility of nuclear destruction is still very much with us.:::1:::3/5
A worthy, important effort - but not a great one.:::1:::3/5
A 91-minute warning to give this generation something to worry about.:::1:::3/5
Comes loaded with a relatively big budget and a line-up of talking heads more powerful than a meeting of the Bilderberg Group.:::1:::4/5
A valuable and scary film that should be seen.:::1:::3/5
Looking at Walker's film objectively, it suggests how damn lucky we've been so far, and attempts to finish on an 'upbeat' note - after scaring the bejesus out of us:::1:::4/5
Sobering stuff, especially when smart talkingheads - including former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and ex-US Secretary Of Defence Robert McNamara - confirm it's a matter of "when" not "if". Eek.:::1:::3/5
By miscalculation, accident or madness (not to mention badness), mankind, or much of it, could evaporate in a nuclear cloud ... the film grabs our attention:::1:::None
If its aim was to scare me, it succeeded.:::1:::A
This film may not be the best researched or most balanced, or most reliable documentary of the year, but it is the scariest.:::1:::B
...a scary, programmatic, depressingly convincing documentary that feels like an alarmistic relic of the Cold War.:::1:::85/100
This somewhat sensationalist yet consistently gripping documentary traces the history of nuclear proliferation and spells out, in chilling terms, the danger facing everyone ( ... ):::1:::None
Coolheaded yet still frightening, Lucy Walker's sobering film makes a strong case, in non-polemical fashion, that political myopia is perhaps helping ink humankind's eventual obituary.:::1:::5/5
Walker ends up trying to end "Countdown to Zero" on an upbeat note. It rings a little hollow; she's scared us so thoroughly throughout the rest of the film that it's a little hard to feel optimistic.:::1:::3/4
Good fences may make good neighbors, as Robert Frost once contemplated, but good causes don't necessarily make good movies.:::0:::2/4
A real threat to human existence is posed by this convincing documentary. The producers want to mobilize public opinion through a campaign to permanently denuclearize the globe.:::1:::3/4
Lucy Walker's documentary is a blood-curdling look at the world's nuclear arsenal that suggests atomic Armageddon remains every bit as likely as during the height of the Cold War.:::1:::3/4
The whole thing could easily be condensed into a sentence: Support nuclear disarmament. There, I just saved you 10 bucks.:::0:::2/5
Earnest entry in the "fear documentary" category promotes nuclear disarmament after shocking us with statistics.:::1:::None
Like the ongoing threat itself, Countdown is simply numbing.:::0:::2.5/4
Between economic meltdowns and catastrophic oil spills, it's easy to forget we're still perched on the brink of nuclear annihilation, too...:::0:::None
Countdown to Zero may not be the most fun you'll have in the movies this year, but it is absolutely mandatory viewing.:::1:::None
If even a quarter of this seemingly unbelievable material can be trusted, that makes this one of the scariest movies seen this year.:::1:::3/4
A smart, sharply made nuke-nightmare documentary that is suitably sobering and completely horrifying.:::1:::A
The title sets up a fascinating double entendre: In bomb-speak, the final explosion. Yet balanced with a far more positive interpretation, i.e., a numeric goal of zero. Giving hope ... as does this film.:::1:::8/10
Made-up horror movies have nothing on Countdown to Zero.:::1:::B+
The news is ugly. The film is often gorgeous and wields a cumulative power to humanize potential devastation.:::1:::3.5/4
Good but even Gary Oldham's serious narration can't compensate for Walker's chaotically:::1:::B-
Lucy Walker's Countdown to Zero is the most terrifying film of the year and one of the most frightening documentaries in a long time.:::1:::None
The days of having a single, identifiable enemy who could vaporize us (and vice versa) seem like good times when Walker chalks up the various ways an atomic disaster could go down today.:::1:::3.5/5
A bluntly effective media campaign as opposed to a well-articulated documentary.:::0:::2/4
Easily the scariest movie of the year.:::1:::B
This is easily the scariest movie of the year, but like a lot of horror films, it goes a bit past the line that it needed to in order to make its point and loses its effectiveness through overkill.:::1:::None
At least it makes you scared again. There's nothing more frightening than what we've learned to live with.:::1:::2.5/4
It's easy to watch, impossible to deny, and very, very tough to forget.:::1:::3/5
Walker adroitly mixes extensive newsreel footage, lively graphics and talking-head interviews with dozens of people, from scientists to think tank folks to world leaders...:::1:::4/5
If you're not already scared about nuclear proliferation, this'll do it.:::1:::3/4
Countdown to Zero is worthwhile to an extent, if that extent is largely to remind the viewer of certain facts that are easily shunted to the back of one's consciousness.:::1:::2.5/4
If your '80s revival can include leg warmers and the cassette tape, then mine can include nuclear anxiety.:::1:::3/5
Urgency doesn't get more urgent than the prospect of millions dying instantly from a low probability event that only proves that low probability events can happen. Scary.:::1:::3.5/5
[A] well-researched, anxiety-provoking film...:::1:::2.5/4
It's fast-paced and engaging, and at 91 minutes it doesn't overstay its welcome. But director Lucy Walker follows the documentary formula with too much maniacal fidelity.:::1:::None
Successful and necessary fear-mongering.:::1:::3/4
There is an undeniable I-can't-take-it-anymore factor at work in scary-bad-news docs of this sort, especially if you were bummed out to begin with.:::1:::B+
This handsomely produced film argues that nukes can be eliminated through enforceable international agreements, just as chemical and biological weapons have been banned.:::1:::3/4
Smart, swift and scary as hell.:::1:::3/4
World destruction is no laughing matter, and yet this movie's treatment of it is sometimes amusingly desperate.:::0:::2/4
Effective and frightening...in making its argument, it emphasizes the worst case scenario, an almost lyrical imagining that has the force of a brutal punch to the gut.:::1:::4/5
Some of the footage is astounding.:::1:::3.5/4
A great message, a not-so-great movie.:::0:::2/4
Countdown never counts the US, conveniently absent from its global rap sheet of potential warmongers. Especially when scanning the list for any culprit who may have already nuked civilian populations, or who continues to amass the largest world stockpile.:::0:::None
'Countdown to Zero' is a sincere editorial with images. That, however, does not make cinema.:::0:::None
Alternately edifying and alarming.:::1:::3/4

The extremely well-acted "The Company Men" ends on a hopeful note, but Wells examines the repercussions of a layoff-based economy with devastating precision.:::1:::3/4
It turns out that people who are fired go through the same Elizabeth Kubler-Ross stages that we experience in facing death, though not exactly in the same order.:::1:::B
Carefully structured to balance the anguish with some hope.:::1:::3.5/5
Films have punctured The American Dream before, but rarely so devastatingly as The Company Men does.f:::1:::4/5
The subject of unemployment numbers caused by the "Great Recession that was almost the Second Great Depression" will likely continue to inspire dramatic feature film attention as well as documentary analysis for years:::0:::3/5
"The Company Men" takes on its big subject forthrightly, and, in an era of service industries and financial instruments, it celebrates the virtue of making useful things.:::1:::None
The cast doesn't treat The Company Men like a slideshow. They take something overly schematic and imbue it with real anxiety, shame, and humility.:::1:::B
It's not that being privileged makes them boring; being two-dimensional does.:::0:::None
Layoffs devastate executives of a Boston-based conglomerate in a well-meaning but inert message drama from writer-director John Wells.:::0:::None
The Company Men does a piercing job of making you feel the dehumanizing effects that losing a job can have on grown men, but it's more truthful and devastating than that.:::1:::3.5/4
A quintet of actors carve out a beautiful, ill-fated geometry in John Wells's layoff drama, which might play like a retort to Up in the Air if it didn't have shortcomings of its own.:::1:::3/5
Critics who praise this politically false economic fairytale can only be part of the system -- and part of the problem.:::0:::None
Before its too-easy conclusion, the movie offers a multifaceted glimpse at what can happen when the connective tissue between a man and his source of income is cut, and rarely suggests that it could be anything less than excruciating to stop the bleeding.:::1:::None
We all know these aren't the best of times, but, with a sly intelligence, a refusal to wallow in sentimentality and some mighty fine actors, this is a movie that also makes us dig in and figure out an upside.:::1:::None
Strong and believable, though its subject may not be one that most moviegoers want to confront at this particular moment in history.:::1:::None
A cocooned, sub-generic drama of downsized executives which locates tragedy in the loss of suburban opulence and white-collar perks rather than self-annihilation.:::0:::1.5/4
This is not simply a pity party for these corporate suits mostly concerned about holding on to their McMansions, fleet of designer cars or country club memberships, while those in the audience may be more stressed about what, if anything, is for dinner.:::1:::None
A shrewd, timely, and terrifically engrossing drama of white-collar reckoning that marks the feature directorial debut of writer-producer John Wells.:::1:::A
"The Company Men" is a somber, glossy, and sound-bite-heavy drama made watchable by its ensemble performances. The story is a letdown, but the actors--including an especially sassy Maria Bello--are enjoyable to watch.:::0:::C+
No matter how hard you've had it during the economic crisis, it's got to make you feel better that Ben Affleck, or at least a character he's portraying, knows what you're going through.:::1:::None
A hard-hitting and creative examination of the scourge of unemployment and how it destroys dreams, brings untold pain and loss, and destabilizes families.:::1:::5/5
Not 'fun' like 'Up in the Air' but a solid drama about the economic mess that we're in:::1:::B+
Are we supposed to think that only those people who "work with their hands" are safe in this economy?:::0:::None

:::0:::None
Dinner For Schmucks seems promising at first but too many plot points feel forced and the humor is too dumb to enjoy.:::0:::4/10
The actors have been placed in a story that is not inherently funny, and they do what they can to muscle it, through their not inconsiderable talents, into working. It doesn't, and you can see the sweat.:::0:::D+
Don't believe the misleading trailers. There's more to laugh at than they would have you believe.:::1:::3/4
The real schmucks are the people responsible for this movie.:::0:::D+
The movie suffers by stifling the [Rudd's] natural comic ability and no one comes away from it fully satisfied.:::0:::2.5/5
You know you're in trouble when the best thing in your movie is a bunch of dead rodents.:::0:::2/4
Occasionally quite funny, and oddly relevant to the nature of our culture, but this dinner is a little underwhelming.:::1:::7/10
A mediocre sitcom serving up a half-baked, TV dinner. Check please!:::0:::1/4
While it has a few humorous moments, the characters are either so bizarre or so stereotyped and the tone so changeable, it's hard to like the movie as a whole.:::0:::5/10
Not quite the four star comedic meal it promises at the outset, Dinner for Schmucks makes for a tasty repast, nonetheless.:::1:::None
Should anyone ever be unfortunate enough to break bread with their characters in Dinner For Schmucks, you'd likely commit seppuku with your butter knife before the entrees had even been cleared from the table.:::0:::1.5/5
There's a little more going on in it than you might expect from a summer comedy starring Steve Carell and Paul Rudd.:::1:::4/5
Dinner for Schmucks might start out as an exercise in laughing at idiots but it turns into something much more rewarding.:::1:::3.5/5
Provides a great showcase for Carell's brand of deadpan nuttiness.:::1:::3/5
The film fails to hold together as the portrait of an unlikely friendship, and the individual moments of brilliance feel like skits in a disjointed whole.:::0:::None
Whenever Clement is on screen with Carell and Rudd Schmucks is rude and funny. The trouble is, the rest of the movie should be like that too.:::0:::2.5/5
It cost around $70 million, according to the Los Angeles Times, which is about $5 million per laugh if I'm generous.:::0:::2/5
Dinner for Schmucks belongs to that mangy breed of American comedy that confuses situations that are genuinely funny for situations that are agonisingly awkward.:::0:::1.5/5
When scene after scene falls flat, and the film seems a lot longer than it actually is, you know that this is a comedy that just isn't working.:::0:::1/5
As the film hits the one-hour mark, it dawns on you this is not coming together as a cohesive comic experience.:::0:::2/5
Rudd and Carell turn out to be a near-perfect double act, with Rudd's exasperated, manic nice guy act a perfect foil for Carell, who gives the kind of broad, nutty, idiot man-child performance we haven't seen from him since his Anchorman days.:::1:::4/5
Remarkably, they have managed to take a very funny original film, some very talented comedians and created an experience akin to a dentist visit.:::0:::None
It's hard to feel sorry for someone who seems to instigate so many of his own problems.:::0:::B-
Steve Carell and Paul Rudd fizzle in this dire, painfully overlong comedy bomb.:::0:::1/5
Dinner for Schmucks, while not as instantly iconic and defined as [Jay Roach's] previous work, still delivers a lot of entertainment.:::1:::3/5
The humour is spasmodic, but for a new target audience of 18 to 34 year olds (not the same crowd that loved the original) the film may offer a simplistic escape and some oddball ideas:::0:::None
A comic misadventure that unfolds like a never-ending series of dastardly mistakes.:::0:::None
Dinner For Schmucks is hilariously entertaining. Its pointed messages, meanwhile, make it even more meaningful.:::1:::None
It wasn't going to be Anchorman 2 but we still expected more from Brick Tamland's reunion with Brian Fantana.:::0:::2/5
A sweet and sentimental comedy that has the potential to be plum duff but too often is just duff.:::0:::2.5/5
A laboured set up brings little reward...:::0:::2/5
Francis Veber's 1998 Le Diner de Cons was no great shakes, but it looks almost classy next to this atrocious remake.:::0:::1/5
Sadly, Dinner For Schmucks isn't a banquet of laughs and the plotting is based around a series of clumsy set pieces.:::0:::None
Ultimately, Dinner For Schmucks will leave you hungry for some bigger laughs.:::1:::3/5
A buttock-clenchingly bad film.:::0:::1/5
Dinner For Schmucks is easily the most obnoxious film of the year, and ranks high among the least intelligent remakes of all time.:::0:::0/5
While a touch lean on the laughs, there's just about enough humour to make it worth catching...:::1:::3/5
You may feel an idiot for staying with it till the end.:::0:::2/5
The result is a dog's dinner.:::0:::1/5
It bungles utilising plenty of talent in a lightweight comedy effort that brings little fresh to the table.:::0:::2/5
A decent cast wrestle with a crummy script in this loose and creaky Hollywood spin on Le Diner de Cons...:::0:::2/5
The good cast of this film promises so much, but they let us down badly in a painfully unfunny waste of time.:::0:::1/5
Most right-minded viewers will be left in a fog trying to make sense of this drivel.:::0:::1/5
The plot rises or falls on our laughing in recognition that we too are capable of the perverse and unkind. Instead, 10 minutes in, we just feel dead.:::0:::1/5
Laugh? Reader, I barely flexed a tonsil.:::0:::2/5
You'd think you'd have the basis for a half-decent comedy. You'd be wrong.:::0:::2/5
An increasingly desperate comedy that wastes a talented comic cast and fails to generate anything resembling actual laughs.:::0:::1/5
This isn't the summer's best comedy, but at this point in the season, when movies typically take a turn for the worse before better fare appears in the fall, it comes through with enough laughs to make it worth a look.:::1:::B-
The Hollywood need for closure, for hugs and happiness, even when the material cries out for savage wit, ultimately dooms "Dinner for Schmucks.":::0:::2.5/4
You won't feel like a schmuck if you see this comedy, but you may not feel it's a truly wise investment of your time and money, either.:::0:::2/4
Had I known everyone was going to play to the back row, that's where I would've sat.:::0:::None
a flawed, but very funny movie that gets less than it probably should out of an all-star comedic cast.:::1:::3/5
[It] saddles some great comic talent in a lame sitcom plot with a feel-good lesson that's about as obvious as it is inappropriate.:::0:::2/4
its primary virtue is its sheer and relatively unpredictable ridiculousness:::1:::2.5/4
A Long, but Satisfying Dinner.:::1:::3.0/4.0
Every time I think back to scenes from this movie, I just see Barry smiling at me. It's a sweet charm that I didn't expect from this movie and it totally works.:::1:::7/10
Despite its shortcomings, at its best Dinner for Schmucks has moments of charm and amusement.:::1:::2.5/5
Carell charms in a scene or two but otherwise this is far from a pleasant night out.:::0:::2/4
... once again demonstrate[s] Hollywood's ability to turn gold into bronze.:::1:::3/5
...one of the most disastrous would-be comedies to come around in quite some time...:::0:::1/4
Some colorful detail and mildly amusing character work (particularly from Steve Carell and Jemaine Clement) gets largely lost in a movie that can't decide whether it wants to be sour or sweet.:::0:::2.5/5
Everything clicks in front of and behind the camera, making Schmucks good summertime movie entertainment.:::1:::B
If you are hungry for a good comedy this one will cause you to lose your appetite:::0:::3/10
Clearly took one funny movie about Tim's relationships and succumbed to the Hollywood pandergeist "we're making a movie with Dinner in the title, there is gonna be a damn dinner!" But Carell makes it very sweet.:::0:::2.5/5
The movie has a slew of goofball moments that don't add up to a consistently hilarious outing.:::0:::2/4
These aren't the kind of laughs that will add points to your IQ. You may actually lose a couple by the time it's all over. But that's OK, because the goofy Dinner for Schmucks doesn't require much brain strain to appreciate.:::1:::2.5/4
Paul Rudd plays Abbott to Steve Carell's too-spastic Costello:::1:::B-
If this bland comedy is the best that the filmmakers could come up with, then I'll pass on dessert.:::0:::2/5
Dinner for Schmucks must be code for the meal filmmakers intend to make out of poor suckers paying good money expecting a laugh. 90 minutes of dead mouse dioramas would've been better entertainment than this.:::0:::1.5/5
Laughter has been shown to be the best medicine for the human heart. So do yourself and your health a big favor by seeing this laugh riot before the spoilers rush in and give away all the punch lines.:::1:::3/4
Skip this Dinner as it'll leave you with a bad aftertaste:::0:::C-
Americanizing a French flick is not in and of itself a death knell for a project. Flattening, sanitizing, and generally smoothing out the edginess in favor of product that is safe, dull, and lifeless is.:::0:::2/5
Carell, who switches it up from The Office's malevolent honcho to mocked nine to five underling, is the occasional best thing going here. Which tends to feature on this particular Moron Who Came To Dinner menu, items of predominantly bad taste.:::0:::None
Dinner for Schmucks has a certain rhythm to it. I chuckled pretty regularly, then every so often something hilarious would happen, and I'd be full-on laughing.:::1:::3/4
If this were a movie about characters rather than overcooked situations and desperate slapstick -- and a lot shorter -- we might have had something.:::0:::2.5/4
A mediocre sitcom serving up a half-baked, TV dinner. Check please!:::0:::1/4
Despite its squishy center, the film still manages to sport a prickly exterior that leads to countless scenes of squirm-inducing hilarity, the sort of curdled comedy more often found in an indie effort than a mainstream studio offering.:::1:::2.5/4
With apologies to Vin Scelsa, Dinner for Schmucks is an idiot's delight:::1:::3/4
Unless you're a hard-core Carell fan, this is one Dinner reservation I'd consider canceling.:::0:::C-
Filled with audacious silly behavior, none of which has an edge to make its comedy sharp.:::0:::C
Be careful with the popcorn. Dinner for Schmucks is laugh-out-loud genius. Take the comment literally. You will laugh-out-loud. Lots.:::1:::4.5/5
Ambles along waywardly for the first half hour before losing steam altogether.:::0:::None
That the film would be funny, at times hilarious, despite having the potential to be needlessly cruel, is not exactly a surprise given the two actors' proven chemistry in those prior films.:::1:::3.5/5
It's just too bad you have to sit through a less than appetizing main course before you get to sink your teeth into the mouthwatering dessert.:::1:::3/5
With moments of fitful hilarity, the pairing of Paul Rudd, Steve Carell and a talented cast of secondary actors, there's plenty here to keep summer comedy fans satiated, if not entirely satisfied.:::0:::2/4
Pure, tasteless slapstick silliness with little on its mind beyond cheap yuks.:::1:::B
A satisfactory meal, but not quite the comedic feast that it might have been had it possessed some spicier ingredients.:::1:::3/5
Hollywood used to produced great comedies that made you laugh until your sides ached and didn't make you feel like you just paid for a lap dance.:::0:::2/5
Dinner for Schmucks may be as broad as the proverbial groaning board, but Rudd and Carell bring out its most toothsome delights.:::1:::2.5/4
The blend of styles with Rudd's everyman realism, Roach's pedestrian visual sense, and the script's "wacky" humor results in a stew of a comedy in which the divergent ingredients never gel into one coherent movie dish.:::0:::None
Veber's comic conceit, which stopped short of actually showing the dinner, doesn't really cross the Atlantic intact.:::0:::C-
Dinner With Schmucks may actually be the funniest movie currently in the marketplace -- but that's pretty much by default.:::0:::2/4
Much less energy, delight, wit, humor and fun than the original was able to muster without any evident strain.:::0:::C
All the disorderly or anarchistic possibilities of its premise get channeled back toward a message of symbolic pseudo-redemption, which is what Hollywood movies have to deliver at all costs.:::0:::None
This may not be the highest achievement of the director's art -- to exceed minimal expectations -- but it's an honorable one, and Roach makes the grade.:::1:::None
In adapting Francis Veber's 1998 French farce Le Diner des cons (The Dinner Game), Roach and his writers David Guion and Michael Handelman have completely defanged it.:::0:::2/4
The point of the movie is how miserable Tim's life is made by Barry, and audiences will know exactly how he feels.:::0:::None
Turns out Dinner for Schmucks is better when you say it in French.:::1:::2.5/4
Where the French leads were nasty, Steve Carell and Paul Rudd have an inherently likable quality even when playing a foolish sap and a cutthroat businessman.:::1:::3/4
...it's hard not to think the portion offered here is just enough to satisfy anyone looking for a few laughs.:::1:::3.5/5
Most of the problem is in the performance of Steve Carell.:::0:::2.5/4
The American version is too obvious and never really gets its hands dirty with a premise that's mean-spirited to begin with.:::0:::C
...near brilliant:::1:::4/5
This remake of a far-nastier French farce is a silly, screwball concept with a definitive 'Odd Couple' emphasis.:::1:::6/10
"Dinner for Schmucks" is one of the funniest movies of the year. Anyone who sees it and doesn't laugh should check their pulse.:::1:::3.5/4
As summer comedies go, it's a small surprise.:::1:::4/5
It has room for a dozen or so comedians to cut loose, many of them at the final dinner party. Before that, though it gets best use out of a killer trio who throw everything they've got into this broad comedy.:::1:::3/4
If the dinner is mean-spirited, the movie really isn't. The tone is more sweet than savage, and the "schmucks" are actually treated with some respect.:::1:::3/4
Along with the 2 leads, akin to a funnier Jerry Lewis/Dean Martin, the cast of zanies brings a pantry full of outrageous ingredients to flavor the whole. If we promise to misbehave, can we come back for dessert?:::1:::8.5/10
Starts strong. And even ends strong. It's that saggy, aimless middle section that might leave an unsatisfied taste in your mouth.:::1:::2.5/4
One good scene in search of an entire movie.:::0:::1.5/4
Jay Roach has cast his picture with standout comic talents...:::1:::3/4
It's funny from the beginning, and it stays funny, even as it beats scenes to death and overstays its welcome.:::1:::3/4
Rudd has mastered the role of the tetchy mensch. He's a straight-man foil with the slightly crooked delivery.:::1:::3/5
I like these three guys. I'd just rather catch them in a different movie.:::0:::C-
It's lurching, desperate and borderline incomprehensible -- a movie whose characters act according to no known precept of recognizable human behavior.:::0:::1/5
Dinner for Schmucks is the type of fatuous American comedy that hopes you'll excuse its narrative's logical inadequacies because it's just a comedy, stoopid.:::0:::2/4
I'm not sure just how brilliant a movie about smart people laughing at idiots can possibly be, but I am sure that the filmmakers considered the audience a bunch of idiots before filming ever started.:::0:::2.5/4
Despite a promising cast and writers clearly recognizing where the original needed extensive improvement, they can't entirely get away from the Veber curse and it infects the middle hour until its almost impossible to recover.:::0:::2/4
The overall film is a mess but the performances from Jemaine Clement, Lucy Punch and Zack Galafianakis make the flick worth watching. Catch the matinee price.:::1:::3/5
Makes you wish Steve Carell would retire from movies instead of his role on The Office.:::0:::2/4
This is a good movie that could have been terrific if it had being more single-minded. Millions will like it; few will love it.:::1:::B-
It's been a while since I've seen a movie that caused me to go back and forth more than a rocking horse at the Gosselin compound. But "Dinner for Schmucks" has me riding the fence and humming The Eagles' Desperado.:::0:::2.5/4
The laughs are pretty spread out, and there is a problem of balance throughout. (Parental Review also Available):::0:::None
Who knows, if it is a big enough success, maybe it will inspire yet another remake and perhaps they will finally get it right that time.:::0:::2/5
Slapstick comedy feasts on the nerdiness of others.:::1:::3/5
A long and rambling comedy about nothing.:::0:::2.5/5
It's easy to laugh at a dumb person, but not so much if that person has deeper handicaps. Even if that was not the intention of the filmmakers, that is unfortunately how it is received.:::0:::2/4
Despite Carell's best efforts, Barry is not a character. He is just an engine for creating humiliating experiences for Tim.:::0:::D
The fault isn't Carell's. It lies with a script that fails to understand its characters and hypocritically decries their boorishness while unself-consciously parading its own - a comedy of bad manners that insults nothing except our intelligence.:::0:::1/4
In contrast to Rudd and Carell's previous efforts, "Dinner for Schmucks," directed by Jay Roach of "Meet the Fockers" fame, is almost two hours of weightless, often witless silliness with Carell doing an uninspired half-wit, holy-fool routine.:::0:::C
Barry's anthropomorphic "mouse-terpieces" are exquisite - funnier and more charming than anything else in the film.:::0:::None
Successfully exchanges the satiric bite of the original for a healthy, satisfying dose of Hollywood slapstick and sentiment.:::1:::B
Against all reason and expectation, the result is a distinctly unfunny film.:::0:::2/5
Dinner for Schmucks has everything that money can buy. That does not include comic inspiration, daring or velocity.:::0:::1.5/4
Steve Carell is perilously close to becoming Robin Williams.:::0:::2.5/4
...the rare remake that is as good as the original. Only I wasn't all that hot on the original.:::1:::B-
A number of bits don't work, some of the characters wear out their welcome, but the whole suckers you into an agreeable state of idiot bliss.:::1:::2.5/4
Dinner For Schmucks is leagues ahead of its forebear in terms of mass appeal, but its laughs are more silly than scathing.:::1:::B-
Something's wrong when dead rodents generate a film's biggest laughs.:::0:::2/4
Give these two a better script, and you just might have a comedy classic. Instead, we have here a tolerable near-miss; enough to keep the hunger pangs away until a real meal arrives.:::1:::2.5/4
A clockwork French farce becomes a rambling Hollywood buddy comedy that's alternately hilarious and cringe-inducing.:::1:::None
The perfect example of Hollywood's lackluster brand of market-tested comedy, Schmucks makes suckers out of anyone expecting more from [Steve] Carell and [Paul] Rudd.:::0:::2/5
It has some good laughs, but much of this film falls flat on its face.:::0:::2.25/5
In some ways an exemplary modern Hollywood comedy.:::1:::3/5
A perfectly stupid and ultimately forgettable comedy from director Jay Roach that will, nonetheless, have you laughing even as the film dissolves from your memory.:::1:::2.5/4
A pleasant enough excursion into the growing genre of male-bonding cringe comedy, though not an entirely memorable one.:::0:::2.5/4
Roach may be the least organic director of comedy currently working in Hollywood.:::0:::None
The same overall effect... could be achieved by intercutting Three Stooges shorts with YouTube videos of adorable kittens rolling around with baby bunnies...:::0:::None
A very funny comedy that also contains some insights on the spiritual exercise of dealing with difficult people.:::1:::4/5
This being a Steve Carell vehicle, these moments of elevated humor coexist alongside crass gags, but not as uncomfortably as you might think.:::1:::4/4
The genius of this version depends on the performance by Steve Carell, who plays Barry Speck as a man impervious to insult and utterly at peace with himself. He's truly a transcendent idiot.:::1:::3/4
Each comic plays it so strong that "over the top" ceases to hold meaning.:::1:::3/5
Despite its schticky title, the trick to Dinner for Schmucks isn't the schmucks, although director Jay Roach's funny comedy, adapted from a 1998 French film, makes sure every group of oddballs is represented.:::1:::3.5/5
Whereas The Dinner Game from celebrated writer-director Francis Veber was a tight, sharp satire of societal pretension, this remake seems more interested in easy, broad slapstick.:::0:::None
...just funny enough, but not because of star Steve Carell.:::1:::3/4
A perfect example of the modern comedy mill gone wrong, a prolonged muddle whose plot, specific situations, and improvised quips never line up.:::0:::None
Carrell is given nothing but spotlight to act like a Shmuck di tutti Shmuck and it is sublime.:::1:::B
When Hollywood decides to remake French farce by Francis Veber, the result can be a champagne cocktail or pate de merde. Dinner for Schmucks falls somewhere in the middle. What makes the souffle rise is the actors.:::1:::2.5/4
These are guys who could send us into hysterics while reading a grocery list, which in this case would constitute an upgrade over the film's screenplay.":::1:::3/5
Thank goodness that Dinner for Schmucks is not the soulless, mean-spirited movie that its ads make it out to be... Unfortunately, it's still not very funny. Outrageous, perhaps, but it's too full of itself to get emotionally invested in.:::0:::2.5/5
I think I'll be in the minority on this one, but you know comedy: Nothing's more personal.:::0:::1.5/4
When the most endearing character is a mouse corpse dressed in a tiny suit, you suspect that the rest of this Dinner might not agree with you.:::0:::2.5/4
Actors are paid to be embarrassing, and audiences pay to get embarrassed. That's the lesson to learn from Dinner for Schmucks, an idiot-comedy for idiots.:::0:::None
The people are funny, but the movie's annoying. Call it I Don't Love You, Man.:::0:::3/5
All that's happened is that a dumb comedy has gotten slightly dumber.:::0:::2.5/5
Steve Carell is the best comic actor working today.:::1:::4/5
The film is sporadically amusing but gives the impression it should be generating more laughs than it does.:::0:::2.5/4
Comedy is often when something tragic happens to someone else. But when that someone is as sweetly guileless as Carell's Barry Speck... the laughter is muffled by he-doesn't-deserve-that sighs.:::0:::B-
A bland, summer-sloppy comedy that never risks actually swimming with schmucks and letting characters bruise themselves on outcroppings of mean fun.:::0:::C
If there ever was a film that could've been a multiplex miracle at 80 minutes, it's this movie. Instead, matters meander for nearly two hours, diminishing a pure expression of stupidity, carried out by a prepared, skilled ensemble.:::1:::B-
Though the premise of Dinner for Schmucks is deeply cruel, we are supposed to laugh, because we trust that by the closing credits the characters will have matured into upstanding men.:::0:::None
Like a four-star desert at the end of a hit-or-miss four-course meal, the finale is worth the wait.:::1:::3/4
What was once a sharp French satire is now a goofball comedy with a heart of gold.:::1:::None

A decent screwball comedy, nothing more.:::1:::B-
Paramount Pictures and director Jay Roach would like to invite you to a dinner they're hosting, at which you are welcome to laugh at these poor jerks. That's a little messed up.:::0:::None
Dinner For Schmucks might not be to everyone's tastes, but it went down easy for me, and since I saw it several weeks ago, I've been interested in a second helping.:::1:::None
One of the few American adaptations that enhances, rather than exploits, its source material..I kept waiting for it to run out of steam or jokes. But it rarely did.:::1:::None
Outrageously funny, delightful and heartfelt. Steve Carell has never been funnier. You'll laugh 'til it hurts.:::1:::5/5
Illustrating the many ways nuclear weapons could kill you makes Countdown to Zero one of the most frightening documentaries you'll ever see, or endure.:::1:::3/4
An explosive and thought-provoking plea to abolish nuclear weapons before they abolish us, as President John F. Kennedy once stated.:::1:::4/5
The nighttime photography, of the world's most luminous cities, awakens our sense of grief -- not for what's gone, but for what could be, in the blink of an eye. The editing by Brad Fuller and Brian Johnson is miraculous.:::1:::None
Walker has something important to say with Countdown To Zero, but if this movie were standing on a doorstep with a petition, most reasonable people would sign it quickly and send it on its way, rather than inviting it in to chat.:::0:::C+
If "An Inconvenient Truth" is the go-to for global warming and "Food, Inc." factory farming, "Countdown to Zero" is the documentary primer on nuclear arms.:::1:::B+
Offers a chilling look at current nuclear arsenals and the weapons programs of North Korea and Iran.:::1:::None
Works as an alarmist doc that effectively conveys a large amount of information ... also a classic case of 'good for you' cinema offering little beyond an admirable agenda.:::1:::3/5
Countdown to Zero comes close to being nuclear-anxiety porn, yet it's the rare film that could trigger and unite the reflexes &#8232; of the left and the right. It makes &#8232; getting rid of nukes seem less like a ''cause'' than an imperative.:::1:::A-
For those of us who remember having to endure The Day After in social-studies class, followed by cheery discussions of nuclear winter, Countdown to Zero will cast a frightening, punishing spell.:::1:::4/5
Never trust a movie that ends with a moveon.org link.:::0:::None
Thankfully, Walker rarely depends on superficial fear-mongering to deliver the message. Her tactics for generating tension are mainly empirical.:::1:::None
it's impossible not to share Countdown to Zero's sense of urgency -- the facts simply demand it -- and, for that reason, the film deserves to be seen:::1:::3/4
Provocative documentary delivers an impassioned plea to bring an end to nuclear weapons.:::0:::None
An activist doc this is not, even if a perfunctory conclusion, in which a score of difficult to achieve solutions to the nuclear problem are floated in rapid succession, represents a feeble attempt at encouragement.:::0:::1.5/4
A politically urgent picture, it will also literally scare the breath out of what will certainly be a worldwide audience.:::1:::None
Well put-together doc reminds viewers there's plenty to fear on the nuclear-weapons front.:::1:::None

Eat Pray Love is overlong and quickly becomes tedious. It features narcissistic, inward looking characters of no interest at all and amounts to a very poorly made film.:::0:::3/10
Liz maybe the most unlikeable character Julia Roberts has ever had to play, not because co-writer/director Ryan Murphy is trying to make her so but because everything the film does pushes her in that direction.:::0:::5/10
A seemingly interminable romantic travelogue that feels as though it takes as long to watch as the year-long spiritual quest it depicts.:::0:::None
The film version is pure wish-fulfillment fantasy.:::1:::3/4
Julia's late career seems an apologia for buying someone else's husband and getting away with it, for the most part, in the court of public opinion.:::0:::0/4
During the India scenes, Liz accuses Richard from Texas of spouting a bunch of bumper-sticker slogans... as though her revelations are any better.:::0:::C
[Takes] itself too seriously, even while it contains all the trappings of one of the most lighthearted movie genres, the 'travel romance' or 'travel therapy' movie.:::0:::5/10
full review at Movies for the Masses:::0:::1/5
El mayor problema es el subrayado permanente de lo que suele llamarse "mensaje", eso que supuestamente el espectador debe descubrir en el transcurso de una pelicula y llevarse al final para su casa y que aqui esta servido como receta.:::0:::2/5
Merely good and not great as many fans of the book hoped it would be.:::1:::3/5
Eat Pray Love is a two hour and fifteen minute ad for being rich; it's a smug, patronising travelogue that -- despite its already apt title -- could have also been called First World Problems: The Movie.:::0:::2/5
On the surface a beautiful film. But those looking for some hidden spiritual meaning be warned - Eat Pray Love doesn't go that deep.:::1:::3/5
It's as though the "phenomenon" of Eat Pray Love got away on itself and, rather than casting a self-deprecating, unknown actress who could embody 30-something middle-class angst, they chose the biggest, richest movie star of the lot.:::0:::2/5
Eat Pray Love ... [hits] its target demographic right between the eyes, but in the same way that a self-help book may appeal to thousands, it will never be great literature.:::1:::3/5
Narcissistic nonsense, styled within an inch of its life in the manner of food, fashion and travel magazines.:::0:::None
The fatal flaw of Eat Pray Love is that for a celebration of enlightenment through travel and the benefits of restorative calm, the end result is so hollow and artificial. Don't mistake entitlement for enlightenment.:::0:::1.5/5
A tiresome, humourless, lifeless, overlong dirge in which the lofty pretention to say something deep about the quest for self and the female condition all gets blown away by an insipid, off-the-shelf romantic-movie ending.:::0:::1/5
The chemistry shared by Roberts and Bardem is alert, alive and alluring: everything the rest of Eat Pray Love should have been, but shied away from.:::0:::None
The director, Ryan Murphy, brings only the most obvious sentiments to the borderline intolerable proceedings.:::0:::1.5/5
There?s too much eating, too much praying and too much loving. I should have known given the title.:::0:::C+
Basically a picaresque rom-com about a girl who needs to feel OK about having everything she could ever want.:::0:::3/5
It is a perfectly competently constructed movie, and an enjoyable one too.:::1:::None
Give me real emotions of guilt, embarrassment and confusion any day over the forgettable trite this film exudes.:::0:::None
While undeniably a chick flick, this is a classy one bolstered by an all-round excellent cast and well crafted script.:::1:::None
Of course, we should remember that the film delivers exactly what it promises by way of the ultimate romantic fantasy for women over 30 or so (divorced or not):::1:::None
While it touches the main plot points of Elizabeth Gilbert's bestselling novel like stepping stones, it is left to Julia Roberts' bewitching smile and Javier Bardem's sensuality to convince us that Liz's journey of self discovery is one we want to take:::1:::None
Preaching to the converted, fans of the book should be sated. Julia Roberts is easy to love.:::1:::3
Eat lots of popcorn to distract you, pray for it to end, and love Richard Jenkins. Amen.:::0:::2/5
It's in equal measure patronising, sententious and obnoxious.:::0:::2/5
A sparkier and more soul-searching script would have made this a much more satisfying journey.:::0:::2/5
An insipid slice of take-charge-of-your-life hokum...:::0:::2/5
A film titled Eat Pray Love should at least capture a spiritual experience and offer romance with some sizzle. This felt more like Eat Grieve Befriend.:::0:::2.5/4
On and on it goes, 140 minutes of tranquillising non-drama. Is there anything to wonder at in its journey to the centre of an ego?:::0:::1/5
Roberts is luminous against breathtaking locations including all of Rome's landmarks and colourful, sun-nourished eastern landscapes.:::1:::None
A movie of picture postcard landscapes and ridiculously hunky blokes, this is very much cinematic comfort food where the answers to life's problems come a little too neatly gift-wrapped.:::1:::None
In the end, the film is far less affecting or thought-provoking than the book.:::0:::2/5
Sit, watch, groan. Yawn, fidget, stretch. Eat Snickers, pray for end of dire film about Julia Roberts's emotional growth, love the fact it can't last for ever. Wince, daydream, frown.:::0:::1/5
What's the worst foreign journey you've ever experienced? Mine is this movie.:::0:::1/5
Roberts' character is difficult to feel sorry for before she sets off on this postcardperfect self-healing binge. She becomes near impossible to like as it becomes apparent we're watching a huge holiday video.:::0:::2/5
The cast is spectacular: Roberts looks relaxed, luminous and credible, Javier Bardem is suitably rugged as her new lover, while Richard Jenkins is brilliant as her grumbling prayer pal.:::1:::4/5
An intriguing story brimming with possibilities is softened beyond all meaning by this glossy Hollywood production.:::0:::2.5/5
A beautiful, languid travelogue, although with some of the source novel's empowerment diluted.:::1:::3/5
The movie is aware of its own riches; it fills up your plate and dares you not to eat.:::1:::4/5
If you like Roberts and understand what it means to ''smile with your liver'', this is the film for you.:::1:::3/5
Roberts' gorgeousness is served up sacrificially to 140 minutes of psychobabbling "insights", many of them trite or questionable, all of them wearisome.:::0:::1/5
Avoid Like Plague.:::0:::1/5
Eat Pray Love has some decent performances and the occasional good moment but it's ultimately let down by a tedious, self-satisfied script, a shocking lack of humour and a criminally indulgent running time.:::0:::2/5
I admired Julia Roberts' grasping for something meatier, but this film sticks her with an unrelatable character that even her coltish smile can't beautify.:::0:::2/4
A drive-through take on mid-life spirituality - with lots of food and travel porn:::0:::C
We're not so much involved in the movie as idly registering it -- eavesdropping, almost, on a conversation at an adjoining table.:::0:::None
Enough compelling moments to make one want to grab the book and fill in the blanks that the movie's script seems to have left out.:::0:::B-
Eat, Pray, Love was more like eat, pray for it to end, gag. Sample from its menu at your own risk.:::0:::None
Though many movies have explored Eastern culture and juxtaposed it against the American experience, there still is something to learn here, especially because it repeatedly questions what's important in life.:::1:::B
It does focus on spirituality, a vital part of most human beings which nevertheless is absent in most films.:::1:::B

The absolute best I can say about this movie is that I didn't hate it, I didn't mind watching it and I see no reason to ever watch it again.:::0:::3/5
... a self-indulgent, annoying and mostly boring movie.:::0:::1.5/4
little more than a self-indulgent wallow in white upper-class privilege feigning depth by cloaking itself in fortune cookie wisdom:::0:::1.5/4
What's inevitably lost is any real attempt to track Liz's internal shifts, the way her travels jostle her preconceived notions of selfhood and spirituality.:::1:::2/4
The movie is completely aware of its own riches; it fills up your plate and dares you not to eat.:::1:::4/5
As summer draws to a close, Eat Pray Love is a pleasurable, sometimes even prayerful, escape.:::1:::None
Despite splendid scenery and an appealing Julia Roberts, the film of Elizabeth Gilbert's best-seller about her year-long spiritual quest fails to capture the humor and uplift of the book.:::0:::None
Fans of the memoir might enjoy this film; others will be checking their watches more than once.:::0:::2.5/5
I saw it. I didn't feel it. Look, I'm happy for Julia Roberts to travel the world. I just never felt connected to the journey of Liz.:::0:::5/10
The audience may find itself wondering how it is that Liz manages to find so many places around the world that can maintain her carefully highlighted hair rather than contemplating the spiritual journey:::0:::2/5
Try not to hoot when the gaunt Roberts makes a bring-on-the-flab speech to persuade the equally slender Tuva Novotny to eat pizza, even if they get "muffin tops.":::0:::None
A nice leisurely pace.:::1:::B-
About the best you can expect from a 21st Century Cinderella with a book deal who had probably already optioned the rights to turn her story into a Hollywood bio-pic.:::1:::3/4
The result isn't spiritual awakening, but a talky travelogue - like riding a tour bus with a passenger who won't shut up about her inner journey.:::0:::2/4
Two and a half hours of staring at your navel, or so it felt. I love Julia Roberts but this movie made you want to scream at the screen, 'Snap out of it!':::0:::5/10
Julia Roberts continues to be one of our finest actresses, and she makes this film less tedious than it could have been.:::0:::None
In a summer dominated (as always) by male-skewering titles, this is a richly rewarding experience for discerning grownups who wouldn't be caught dead seeing Grown Ups.:::1:::3.5/4
It's a shame the actors have to spoil cinematographer Robert Richardson's artistry by reciting the drivel that passes for dialog.:::0:::1.5/5
Rodney [Dangerfield] may have cracked about "praying after you eat," but this film reflects the need to surfeit before finding balance.:::1:::6/10
Let the cynics scoff - this is a movie that's beautiful to look at that will leave you with some food for thought, as well.:::1:::4/5
The cast, led (by the nose) by Roberts, is pretty. The men are handsome and sensitive. The scenery is beautiful and the techs and production are first class. I still wish that Liz went back to Italy and had another pizza.:::0:::C
While Eat Pray Love has some enlightening, touching, visually breathtaking moments, you still end up praying it would end.:::0:::2/4
Roberts is precisely the right actress to play this character: She adamantly refuses to be adorable -- she'd rather just unleash that crazy, unladylike cackle.:::1:::None
If you're in the mood for a Julia Roberts film that provides two hours of "Calgon take me away", this is it.:::1:::None
If you've ever been on a vacation that becomes an adventure of meeting interesting, vibrant people, "Eat Pray Love" will bring you back.:::1:::None
If only this movie could have stopped at "Eat.":::0:::2.5/4
The movie left me with the feeling of being trapped with a person of privilege who won't stop with the whine whine whine.:::0:::1/4
Amounts to the McDonalds version of spirituality, but there is some (obvious) truth in the joy of travel and food, the need for a life of balance and reflection.:::1:::2.5/4
Do you always talk in bumper sticker? Julia Roberts asks Richard Jenkins as they banter back and forth at an ashram in India. Yes, he does. And so does Eat Pray Love.:::0:::2/5
Exotic, escapist and superficially spiritual, it's shallow, indulgent female wish-fulfillment, sailing off into the sunset.:::0:::6/10
Julia Roberts is back with her best role since "Erin Brockovich"! Jenkins is amazing, with standout supporting work that deserves serious Oscar consideration. The pacing is solid despite a 133-minute run time & you get so caught up with the...:::1:::3.5/4
A female adventure movie aimed almost exclusively at 30 or 40-something women who feel there must be more to life than the way they are currently living it.:::1:::3.5/5
"Betray Devour Invade" would have been a more appropriate title.:::0:::D
The movie, which was shot in chronological order in the countries Gilbert visited, is also visually striking, more reminiscent of a travelogue than a Hollywood blockbuster.:::1:::3.5/5
Eat Pray Love is ultimately charming and inspirational. Though it doesn't have quite the impact of the book, it will likely leave you pondering your life choices and forgiving your flaws. It will certainly have you forgiving the few flaws in the film.:::1:::7.5/10
Mired in a milquetoast aesthetic obsessed with trendy "healing" tropes (meditation, close-ups on delicious looking pasta, hunky Javier Bardem etc.).:::0:::2/4
It's the Oprahfication of religion &#8230; Liz's time in India is spiritual tourism, as her time in Italy was culinary tourism; it's all a self-help consumerist approach to world cultures.:::0:::D
This is the rare "chick flick" that treats its demographic with respect, never becoming the sentimental or manipulative dreck that so many other filmmakers would have delivered from Elizabeth Gilbert's bestselling memoirs.:::1:::None
Eat Pray Love is like an overstuffed lightweight suitcase, with little room for us to feel the emotional connections Liz makes with new friends along the way.:::0:::2/4
Hanging out with Julia Roberts being all glowy and charming -- even when she's somewhat sad about whatever it is she's sad about -- is still kind of pleasurable.:::0:::2.5/5
Eat Pray Love only superficially advocates independence and growth while serving up a steaming pile of pseudo-spiritual hyperbole.:::0:::2/5
This film is about a woman trying to move mountains to make herself happy, and the singular quest of every other character in the movie is to serve her in that quest.:::0:::1.5/5
An insane fantasy for rich people.:::0:::C
"Eat Pray Love" rests on Roberts' talented shoulders. Her appeal and personality overcome most of the film's defects, including a too-long running time, and some platitudes and words of wisdom that sound as if they were written by Hallmark.:::1:::3/4
It may come as a bit of a shock to some that the most interesting turns in the woman-on-a-quest sojourn don't belong to Roberts, luminous though she is. Those are owned by a number of misty-eyed if masculine menfolk.:::1:::3/4
Goldilocks And The Three Boy Toys. While in search of the chick flick demographic, the misguided message is that hedonism is the new feminism. But Liz does learn a few things, like mastering the art of guilt-free eating and embracing your inner fatty.:::0:::None
Eat. Pray. Love. Barf....A celebration of self-indulgence trying to pass itself off as profound soul-searching.:::0:::D+
The movie is above all a lovely travelogue, plunging us viscerally into the middle of every country.:::1:::2.5/4
I stopped trusting the movie.:::0:::None
It's all external trappings trying to express internal developments, and the movie's hand-holding stridency just emphasizes the artificiality of its fantasy.:::0:::C+
There's something ridiculously and deeply sad about what Eat Pray Love reveals about the deprived lives American women lead.:::1:::None
Find-your-bliss film appeals but raises questions, too.:::1:::3/5
One wonders: Was the screenplay presented to Julia Roberts as a traditional bound manuscript, or as a catalog of bumper stickers?:::0:::2/4
For two decades, Julia Roberts has been a bona fide movie star, and she shines in his gorgeous if overlong travelogue.:::1:::4/5
Eat Pray Love is a long marathon full of self pity and poor interaction.:::0:::1/5
Eat Pray Love presents Liz's road to enlightenment in ways that are too reverent, too episodic, and too self-absorbed.:::0:::None
Rather than winning us over, this protagonist merely annoys. We edge close to AA territory as a friend tells her to "do the work!" He also exhorts her to forgive herself. For what? Boring us to death?:::0:::2.5/10
It's a thin line between "self-aware" and "self-involved" and it's one the movie treads uncertainly.:::1:::2.5/4
Despite its flaws, an intelligent, beautiful-looking film about the power of one person to radically change the life of another is an unexpected treat in a season of mindless entertainment.:::1:::None
A hornet's nest of irrational behavior, wrapped up snugly in a smug, shallow, and diseased feature film that does a masterful job brainlessly wiggling around for an interminable amount of screentime.:::0:::D
The film's most crucial constituency -- the book's rabid fans -- are likely to feel well served by Murphy's adaptation, which hews pretty faithfully to Gilbert's story.:::1:::2.5/4
Easy to swallow if hard to digest, at 2:20. It's like sitting in a warm bath - except that you run out of hot water a long time before you're allowed to get out of the tub:::0:::None
A vacuous attempt at chick flick epiphany. For all its postcard prettiness, Eat Pray Love's purported life lessons are so self-absorbed, had our shallow heroine been a man, we'd be booing his caddish behaviour.:::0:::2.5/5
Even if you buy Roberts as an introspective writer (I didn't), there's no real sense of an emotional journey here.:::0:::1.5/4
You know exactly what you are going to get, kinda like comfort food for your movie going soul.:::1:::2.5/4
Comes off more like a female midlife crisis fantasy than a substantive search for knowledge and inner peace.:::0:::2/4
Eat Pray Love is the cure for insomnia. The film is boring and a gigantic advertisement for The Travel Channel, Food Network and Lifetime.:::0:::2/5
It's about something important, the search for meaning and happiness, about finding one's inner life amid the clutter and confusion of modern existence.:::1:::3/4
... an irritating, smug film about a horrible person, a narcissistic destroyer of worlds so caught up in romancing her impossibly sensitive self that she doesn't even notice the needless damage she inflicts on her fellow creatures.:::0:::78/100
Eat Pray Love is mostly a slog; never giving us a compelling reason why its heroine does what she does, or how she became quite so tiresomely self- absorbed.:::0:::2/4
I've got a fourth verb to add to the comma-challenged title of Julia Roberts' how-to-be-happy travelogue, Eat Pray Love. How about "edit"?:::1:::2.5/4
Most of what made the book connect with so many is entirely missing here.:::0:::C
Liz figures she needs to spend some time with no one but herself. Speaking as one who has spent 140 minutes with her, I would advise against that.:::0:::D+
Was something lost in translation or was the source material not as strong as book sales would have us believe?:::0:::C-
Overlong, repetitive, too simplistic, and bland despite oodles of breathtaking scenery. It's like a healthy dish that looks aesthetically pleasing, but lacks flavor and needs a more talented chef.:::0:::4.95/10
At the end of the two and a half hours we get to the same point of all the other stereotypical chick flicks. This is an overly intellectual version of any other Jennifer Lopez or Kate Hudson romantic comedy.:::0:::C
The film, which admittedly stumbles in the home stretch and just misses out on something like greatness, is nonetheless a visual and metaphysical delight. Come hungry, come searching, come lonely.:::1:::7.5/10
[These] are not the teachings one would find for oneself but things out of a self-help book. They feel planned.:::0:::1.5/4
In short, it probably should have been titled 'Eat Pray Love Sleep' as it becomes increasingly difficult to fight off the latter while watching it. (Parental Review also Available):::0:::None
It's hard to call this a bad movie as it is wonderfully and beautifully shot and directed, but its failure to grasp any meaning in its end and its steady decent into boredom make it a failure as a movie overall.:::0:::None
Eat Pray Love lies across the screen like a patient on life support whose ticker is about to tick its last tock.:::0:::5/10
A minor and superficial summer diversion that offers female viewers not much more than a two-hour escape fantasy.:::0:::None
Roberts has taken a role that could have been played very stereotypically (lonely divorcee' searches for love and the secret of life) and breathes life into it.:::1:::2.5/4
Awesome photography but possessing more schmaltz than herring shoppers will find at Zabar's on a Sunday shopping spree.:::0:::C+
There were plenty of ways for the film to signify Liz welcoming love back into her life without the trite conclusion that has been conceived here, and it is the one drawback to an otherwise pretty fantastic picture.:::1:::3/4
Glibly portrays selfishness as a life choice, ranking gluttony on a par with finding God and a life partner.:::0:::1.5/4
It helps that Roberts rides all the turbulent waves with such ease and such grace, that Jenkins knows exactly what to do with his internal churn, and that Bardem can do no wrong.:::1:::3/5
An ambitious but confused and frustrating film that circles near catharsis, occasionally brushing its hem, but that's about as close as it ever gets.:::0:::2.5/5
Supply acted and engrossing.:::1:::B
The book's internal dialogue, that of a good observer with a lively mind, has turned into the extravagantly external and cloyingly earnest quest of a woman in deep distress.:::0:::None
[Roberts] has a down-to-earth, Everywoman quality that adds to the film's "you go, girl" mojo.:::1:::3/4
Lives are messy. A little mess in the movie wouldn't have hurt at all.:::0:::2.5/4
Most of its supposed observations sound more like touchy-feely mumbo-jumbo than honest, useful information and advice.:::0:::2/4
This is a movie about a self-obsessed woman who seems to learn that the wisdom of the ancients is that she should be even more self-obsessed.:::1:::B-
You know your movie's in trouble when its star is outshined by a bowl of spaghetti.:::0:::2/5
An effective and frequently satisfying indulgence, but not nearly as much as the book was.:::1:::3/5
Ryan Murphy brings Elizabeth Gilbert's best-selling self-realization memoir to the big screen as a glossy, Julia Roberts starring travelogue that gives more insight into where to get a great pizza than the benefits of striving for enlightenment.:::1:::B-
Let us not underestimate the contribution of our lead. Roberts plays down the glamour and turns up the soulfulness, and her off-the-charts likability makes her winning and watchable, even when Liz is at her whiny wimpiest.:::1:::3/4
Roberts is the obvious focus here, but she's enough of a pro to get out of the way and let a scene be stolen.:::1:::4/5
vibrant editing, an intelligible screenplay, and a magnetic performance by Julia Roberts keep Eat, Pray from dipping too far into self-indulgence.:::1:::4/5
Its span may be global, but its scope is modest, and it accepts a certain superficiality as the price of useful insight.:::1:::3.5/5
The film knows the aesthetic of enlightenment, the filmmakers demonstrate adoration for their subject, but whether or not the film grasps the principle further is very arguable.:::1:::3/5
The film version's biggest challenge? The road to self-discovery is littered with cliches.:::0:::2.5/4
Only hard-core fans of Oprah's BFF will be able to stomach this navel-gazing tripe, which posits "me-first" consumerism as the road to happiness.:::0:::None
Watching the relationship between Liz and Felipe evolve from a comforting friendship to a love that's both companionable and sexy is gratifying.:::1:::None
A well-meant, if not exactly transcendent, adaptation of Elizabeth Gilbert's beloved, Oprah-endorsed memoir.:::1:::3/5
Eat Pray Love will be an intense spiritual experience for many who see it - they will end up on their knees, praying for its merciful end.:::0:::C
An overlong bore that either mistakenly thinks it's something more than a humdrum romance or has incorporated a variety of pretentions as window-dressing.:::0:::1.5/4
Politics and economics hardly exist; each place is populated chiefly by wise exotics who talk funny (including Richard Jenkins' Texan in the ashram) and exist solely to spout slogans and tell stories that make Liz's problems seem small.:::0:::None
A sensuous and emotionally cathartic adaptation of Elizabeth Gilbert's spiritual journey to personal transformation and love.:::1:::5/5
Mostly it's the pleasant company of Julia Roberts that makes Eat Pray Love a benign, sometimes soporific slide into femme fantasy -- a less vulgar shopping trip than Sex and the City 2.:::0:::2/5
Goldilocks And The Three Boy Toys. While in search of the chick flick demographic, the misguided message is that hedonism is the new feminism. But Liz does learn a few things, like mastering the art of guilt-free eating and embracing your inner fatty.:::0:::None
Like a 2 1/2 hour infomercial about sharing your feelings that replaces any true emotions with some of the most ridiculous and useless spiritual rhetoric you're ever likely to hear.:::0:::4/10
A surprisingly joyless, almost-2-hour fable about finding your joy and starring Julia Roberts, whose innumerable voice-overs become increasingly grating and unwelcome, the film, directed by Ryan Murphy, is inert.:::0:::C
At the moment, the only person eating more delectably in Italy is Tilda Swinton in I Am Love.:::1:::3/4
Though there are a handful of funny lines, the deeper observations are facile. The whole journey feels like a rich girl gone slumming.:::0:::2/4
Elizabeth Gilbert's phenomenally popular memoir was funny, insightful, and well-written. Amazingly, so is the film.:::1:::A-
The superficial Eat Pray Love wants to chronicle a person's rejuvenation through revelatory life experience, but it feels like tapas for the soul.:::0:::2.5/5
The film is a fairly faithful transcription of events, even though Liz, as played by Roberts, carries a faint air of entitlement. I'm not sure this could be avoided on screen.:::0:::2/4
You can see how it would be fun to spend a year traveling with Gilbert. A lot more fun than spending nearly 2.5 hours watching a movie about it.:::0:::2/4
Murphy's film version of the story is relentlessly superficial, a slick, empty travelogue propped up only by Roberts' natural charisma.:::0:::2/5
Like any beloved book with a pretty film version, there will be fans of this film, in spite of its flaws. And bless them. I was, mostly, frustrated.:::0:::None
Julia Roberts boasts a charming presence and a lively mind but she deserves better than this superficial, glitzy and fluffy travelogue of self discovery, which has lots of food, some prayers but little love or sex.:::0:::C
Elizabeth Gilbert's best selling tome has been dumbed down and glossed up. Fans of the introspective will be disappointed: those looking for decent, escapist entertainment will not.:::0:::None
Approached purely on the surface, Eat serves a sensual cinematic meal.:::1:::3/5
It seems determined to drag tears out of the audience, when the quiet, underplayed moments are the ones that pack the true firepower.:::1:::None
If only Roberts' warmth, coupled with Javier Bardem's scruffy sexiness as Felipe, were enough to compensate for the folded-map flatness of this production.:::0:::C+
It provides a gorgeous escape, exquisitely photographed and full of female wish fulfillment. Yet it also offers sufficient emotional heft and self-discovery to make you feel as if you've actually learned something.:::1:::None
Unlike the book, there's no big emotional breakdown; instead, this is a postcard-pretty case of midlife soul-searching.:::0:::2.5/5
Ryan Murphy's film adaptation of Elizabeth Gilbert's bestseller about the divorced New Yorker's lone odyssey to Italy, India and Bali to find meaning in her life is a shallow guilty pleasure: an escapist Julia Roberts romance and exotic travelogue.:::0:::B-
A heavily idealized journey of self-discovery with a pretty woman (Julia Roberts), pretty scenery and a pretty shallow view of Eastern spirituality.:::0:::None
Here's one Hollywood comedy that actually makes you laugh.:::1:::B+
There's rapport between Steve Carell and Paul Rudd, well cast as the Odd Couple, but the source material (French farce), which was nastier in dissecting manners and mores, has been softened and the comedy is not funny enough.:::0:::C+
An uproarious odd-couple remake of Francis Veber's hit French farce The Dinner Game.:::1:::None
Steve Carell finds a character more clueless than Michael Scott in broad laffer redeemed by occasional quirks.:::1:::None

A thoughtful and harrowing drama about the lengths people will go to survive - and the changes of heart that one person undergoes to help them.:::1:::3.5/4
Films like this are musicals for people who enjoy gunfire and Mel Gibson being shouty. They're that satisfyingly heightened version of reality no one actually gets to experience.:::1:::3/5
Adapted from the landmark BBC mini-series by original director Martin Campbell, Edge of Darkness is a polished piece of political suspense masquerading as a crime drama and pulling off both rather successfully.:::1:::8/10
The attempt at grittiness comes off soft.:::0:::2.5/5
Monahan mistakes rambling exposition for captivating back-and-forth and Campbell doesn't help any by making the film as drab and turgidly paced as possible.:::0:::2/5
Martin Campbell returns to the once edgy and jagged ground of his excellent BBC miniseries Edge of Darkness with a much slicker spin that sheds much of what made the first go around so good.:::0:::None
Sadly the movie is a ponderous, unnuanced, run-of-the-cyclotron thriller.:::0:::None
Gibson, of course, snaps and snarls and blows out some brains with a joylessness that is thoroughly enjoyable. It's like he never left.:::1:::None
Mel Gibson returns with one of his finest performances in the gripping yet patchy thriller, Edge of Darkness.:::1:::3.5/5
Gibson brings his full tormented game: whatever's wrong with the movie, it isn't him.:::1:::4/5
An otherwise entertaining revenge thriller with Mel Gibson and Ray Winstone shining above material that transforms throughout the course of its plot...:::1:::None
Glossy exploitation cinema without guts.:::0:::C
The whole fails to really satisfy as either an action or mystery thriller.:::0:::2.5/4
As expertly headlined by Mel Gibson...Edge of Darkness makes a virtue of its fatalism, while ace mainstream director Martin Campbell compensates well for the script's shortcomings in the credibility department. [Blu-ray]:::1:::2.5/4
Standard rogue copseeks-revenge story is more entertaining than most thanks to Mel Gibson's seething (and likely self-referential) turn as police detective Thomas Craven, who'll stop at nothing to bring down the corporate meanies who did in his daughter.:::0:::80/100
... recalls contemporary American crime fiction as much as British conspiracy thriller, and at its best it's a piece of blunt force drama...:::1:::None
For all his silly charm, undiminished by his off-screen controversies, Gibson is most fascinating when wrestling with his demons.:::1:::3.5/4
While it offers nothing particularly new or original, it does maintain one's interest and provides a welcome return to the screen of a fine actor.:::1:::7/10
Boasting a nuclear facility roach motel where you can't check out, a villain politician who just happens to be a Democrat, and a kindly hitman played by Ray Winstone, but who was originally Robert De Niro until he backed out over creative differences.:::0:::None
With the lack of energy infused in the film, it's hard to get truly embroiled in the conspiracy but that doesn't mean Edge Of Darkness is a complete failure.:::1:::3/5
It's certainly a worthy attempt at resurrecting the genre, but with guys like Martin Campbell and William Monahan pulling the strings, Edge of Darkness should have been a whole lot better.:::1:::3/5
Edge of Darkness is at its core a story about a man grieving from an inconsolable loss. This doesn't ground just the film, it grounds Gibson's performance, which is among the best in his career. Possibly the best.:::1:::3/4
Even with its flaws, it's a top-notch nail biter that tries to be less about the kills and more about the thrills.:::1:::B
All attempts at profundity are silenced by the deafening anger at the movie's core. And the deeper the film delves into its layered plot, the more ludicrous it becomes.:::0:::1.5/4
Martin Campbell's direction keeps the uneasy mix of Death Wish 2 and Michael Clayton taut for a good deal of the running time:::1:::None

Convoluted action thriller.:::0:::C+
Though Ray Winstone does his best to elevate this story, in the end Edge of Darkness is a fairly basic Mel beats up the bad guys flick:::1:::3.5/5
It worked for Denzel and Liam. Why not Mel? Losing a child gets an audience on the side of the hero faster than anything. Mel is in fine form. Stick to acting, buddy. Paul Chambers, CNN.:::1:::B-
The movie, directed by Martin Campbell, is solid entertainment, with a decent script and some choice dialogue.:::1:::3/4
Give this one a pass and see Winstone in 44 Inch Chest instead.:::0:::None
An entertaining enough thriller, even filled with enough dumb dumb plot holes, to if not welcome the butt kicking, heart of gold Mel Gibson back into good graces, at least give him a temporary access pass.:::1:::None
While the film is generally boring and by-the-numbers for the majority of its running time, it adds enough surprising twists to make itself worthwhile.:::1:::2.5/5
It doesn't exactly herald the return of Mel Gibson, movie star, but Mel Gibson, working actor %u2014 that title fits.:::1:::2.5/4
...a passable yet wholly underwhelming piece of work...:::0:::2/4
It's a Mel Gibson film. You take him as he comes, which is usually at full pelt.:::1:::3.5/5
Edge of Darkness is a surprisingly well-done thriller. Unfortunately, after an hour and a half of substantial filmmaking, it collapses into a Lethal Weapon #6 climax. But the bulk of the film is worthy.:::1:::2.5/5
Even though Gibson gives a fine performance, this film succeeds because of Director Martin Campbell, who keeps the pace up and the tension rising.:::1:::10/10
A Death Wish movie that's bamboozled itself into thinking it's somehow important.:::0:::2/5
Gibson does righteous anger better than just about any living actor, and Edge of Darkness thrives best when he's pushed to the limit:::1:::3/4
A new genre is emerging in which aging A-list actors play fathers off on a rampage to rescue their daughters or avenge their deaths.:::0:::2/4
What's really disturbing is the manner in which the violence is presented. It's not campy fun and it's not realistic for a reason...It wants you to cheer along: Enjoy the bloodlust!:::0:::1.5/4
I hope the miniseries lives up to its reputation, because the film version is a dud, devoid of any tension, suspense or good storytelling.:::0:::2/4
For the third act it loses all credibility and suspense by derailing into a messy and pulpy mash-up of Dr. No and Death Wish.:::0:::2.5/5
Solid, hard-hitting and tense, "Edge of Darkness" is a drama for grownups who enjoy thrillers.:::1:::3/4
This movie marks the return of "Mad Mel" and he is in rare form. He dominates the film by being believably bereaved and vengeful:::1:::7/10
An uneven, somewhat meandering thriller is given emotional pull by Mel Gibson's excellent comeback performance. The lethal weapon hasn't lost it.:::1:::3/5
Scriptwriters William Monahan and Andrew Bovell have sadly sacrificed some of the original's cultural specificity and its slow-burn quality.:::0:::2/5
Passable action thriller crafted solidly but unimaginatively, with a penchant for ridiculous tough-boy banter.:::0:::2.5/5
This paranoid corporate political thriller is almost certain to disappoint anyone hoping for a repeat of the brooding suspense of the original.:::0:::2/5
The film takes the revelations and twists at a hectic gallop, though it omits the spiritual, Gaia-is-angry mysticism of the original. It's not too bad, though it lacks the style of the recent film version of State of Play.:::0:::2/5
This tumble towards knee-jerk revenge makes a brutish mess of a once-intelligent piece of storytelling, as if Charles Bronson had bagged the Ralph Fiennes role in The Constant Gardener.:::0:::2/5
Here the genre seems painfully cliched and heavy handed, implausible in one scene, gratuitous in another, then in turn sentimental and trite.:::0:::None
It's a bold comeback by Hollywood's prodigal son, but he doesn't beg for sympathy either. If only such guts could be found in the script - instead of splattered all over the floor at the last minute - this might have been a classic.:::1:::3/5
For anyone prepared to make the necessary allowances - and there are a lot of them - it's an exhilarating ride. And at the very least, you get to see Gibson back on vengeful form. He's not too old for this s**t yet.:::1:::3/5
Gibson proves he's still not to be messed with in a film that reasserts him as a sturdy, if rather grizzled leading man. A pity, though, this required Campbell to cookie-cut his masterly '80s TV series into a formulaic actioner.:::1:::3/5
Gibson is on good form and Campbell, as you would expect from the director of Casino Royale and GoldenEye, stages some effective set pieces.:::1:::3/5
Mad Mel can do vicious vengefulness like few others, but not even he can overcome a script that makes him do many things that are palpably stupid.:::0:::2/5
Although entertaining, if workmanlike, for the first hour or so, it gets too carried away with its conspiracies - plus Gibson's faux Boston accent is just terrible.:::0:::3/5
Remember the Simpsons episode where Mel Gibson lets Homer re-cut his movie and the results are ridiculous? This is like that movie. It aims for serious but comes off hilarious.:::0:::2/5
As if to divert the viewer from the mounting feelings of frustration and bafflement, Gibson crashes a car or cracks a skull every couple of scenes.:::0:::2/5
By the final reel the script has lost all interest in the plot's complexities and drops the pretence of "darkness" in favour of a frenzied shoot-'em-up.:::0:::1/5
Perforated with plot holes, and disastrously unsure of its tone, it starts steadily and sombrely, before switching to a hysterical parody of a conspiracy thriller: a parade of irrelevant car chases and ridiculously public assassination attempts.:::0:::None
Mel Gibson's grief-ravaged, vengeance-seeking Boston cop is the best thing about this decent, unnecessary revamp of the 1985 BBC drama.:::1:::3/5
The film, while it doesn't lack tension, never catches fire. Compared with the mini-series, it seems flattened out and improbable. It's as if the change in setting has changed the mood too. And not for the better.:::0:::2/5
This dramatic thriller tries to pack so much into two hours that it ends up feeling thin and repetitive. But it's great to have Gibson back on screen.:::0:::2.5/5
What's left still holds up nicely, thanks to firm plotting, Campbell's neat direction and a brace of decent performances.:::1:::3/5
Despite the sometime derivative trappings of the modern thriller, he delivers an intense slice of solid entertainment - although he never quite captures the trust-nobody paranoia of the original series.:::1:::3/5
It's no candidate for greatness, but it does a good job of condensing a six-hour story into a lean thriller without feeling as if too much has been sacrificed.:::1:::3/5
A bleak but engrossing and gripping thriller.:::1:::4/5
The film version condenses six episodes of edge-of-seat suspense into an engrossing two hours.:::1:::None
Everything about Edge of Darkness feels second-hand, though. The plotting is stodgy, the dialogue cliched, and even the action sequences never get out of second gear.:::0:::2/5
There are plenty of tense, even powerful moments, but they're surrounded by so much talky bullshit, illogical plotting and mumbly dialogue that they quickly lose all meaning.:::0:::None
Among the guns, fisticuffs and kicks, Gibson plays Craven as both vulnerable and lethal. Mel Gibson plus lethal. That is an original concept.:::1:::C+
Gibson remains as rough and tough as ever, yet his older figure and stern demeanour provide a personable core to what could have spiralled out into a violence frenzy or incomprehensible whodunit.:::1:::4.5/5
Perhaps the intrigue could have been boosted a little, but the formidable performances, biting script and Campbell's flair for visual storytelling make this a riveting, smart and unexpectedly moving thriller.:::1:::None
I liked the pace and the pulse of the film, but it launches no genuine surprise and, despite being irradiated with scenes of sickness and morbid one-liners, has little afterglow.:::1:::None
Edge of Darkness is a meathead revenge picture, but it's very satisfying.:::1:::None
It's a deeper and more thought-provoking film than I could have expected or imagined.:::1:::A-
Ray Winstone's shady character represents both the screenwriter's desperate attempt at coherence and the audience's confusion; especially as he keeps delivering the line, "it's my job to keep it convoluted.":::0:::None
The weightiness and the catastrophic implications of the conspiracy don't sit well with what is essentially a Death Wish-inspired revenge fantasy.:::0:::2.5/4
The headline hoohah of the last couple of years made most of us forget that Gibson is an exceptional actor.:::1:::4/5
The mix and match of genres can certainly work in the right hands, but Campbell, an excellent journeyman director, never quite nails it down here.:::0:::None
A flawed, middle-of-the-road, mildly enjoyable thriller.:::0:::C-
...a thriller that will keep you guessing right up to its poetic but fitting ending.:::1:::3/5
A cross of The Lovely Bones and No Way Out, only in Bostonese!:::1:::2.5/4
Crazy Mel returns From the Edge of Darkness. I'm not sure what I expected from this movie but it is a good solid return to form for Mel. Just stay off the coo-coo pills.:::1:::B
After a solid, sensitive first-half, it disintegrates into standard-order, often senseless and inconsistent action, centering on maniacal Mad Mel.:::0:::6/10
In a time when the films grossing the most are 3D, CGI monsters, it was a relief to see what is, essentially, a good old, well acted story. Other filmmakers would do well to remember that, as pretty as the icing is on a wedding cake, no one wants to eat i:::1:::8/10
On the surface, Edge of Darkness might seem like your typical violent revenge thriller, but it actually has some intriguing layers and surprising twists that get your full attention.:::1:::3/4
Mesmo nao sendo um grande filme, ao menos prova que Gibson ainda pode carregar um projeto com facilidade.:::0:::3/5
Gibson delivers some great lines in the movie. His successful return to the screen mirrors Clint Eastwood's performance in "Gran Torino".:::1:::3/4
Edge of Darkness is more detective story than action-packed Taken knock-off, but if you miss Mel Gibson on the big screen it's worth checking out.:::1:::3.5/5
amid the foreseeable twists and overused plot points, I had a lot of fun watching Mel Gibson kick ass:::1:::3/5
It's good to have you back, Mel.:::1:::3.5/5
Mel Gibson is back and he's got an edge-of-your-seat thriller to show for it.:::1:::None
Gibson lights a bonfire under his old self, and once word gets around about this taut, seamless thriller, his body of fans may come full circle.:::1:::None
Both smarter and thornier than advertised. Gibson is beginning to breathe the same rarefied craggy air of folks like Lee Marvin, Robert Ryan, and Warren Oates ... See the movie; stay off his lawn.:::1:::None
An initially intriguing policier that gradually loses suspense and cleverness as it bites off more than it can chew.:::0:::5.75/10
Slow and silly plot notwithstanding, if you like your Mel Gibson out of control and a little bit crazy, this movie is for you.:::0:::2/5
Edge is a gripping thriller reminiscent of Martin Scorsese's Oscar-winning The Departed, and Mel Gibson serves up a ferocious performance.:::1:::3/4
If Edge of Darkness exists simply to get Mel Gibson back on the big screen ... so be it.:::1:::3/4
Mel delivers on the darkness the title promises. It seems like his most intense performances since Lethal Weapon. I could imagine some of the scenes in this comparing to Riggs' suicide attempt.:::1:::None
A remarkably accomplished thriller, one that's never anything less than good and even approaches the edge of greatness.:::1:::None
Campbell and his cinematographer, Phil Meheux, create a pervasive sense of dread, with danger lurking around every corner of Boston and its environs.:::1:::3/4
If it sometimes seems as if we've seen this particular Mel Gibson movie before, well, we haven't seen it for a long time. And it has aged reasonably well.:::1:::3.5/5
Edge of Darkness is effective as a cathartic revenge yarn, at least until the absurdities begin to pile up during the final half-hour.:::0:::2.5/4
It's a revenge thriller ripped from today's headlines. Well, ripped from the headlines of 25 years ago, anyway.:::0:::4/10
Edge of Darkness is reasonably well executed, but its competence reeks of fatigue. Another dead kid. Another angry dad. Another day at the office.:::0:::2.5/5
This film could have been two hours of Gibson scanning through microfiche and it wouldn't have been any more dull.:::0:::3/10
Gibson looks every bit his age, but he can still bring the fierce determination as well as anyone in the business.:::1:::3/5
Edge of Darkness is offered as a political thriller, but with real-world politics removed. What we're left with is a familiar mechanism for delivering a vicarious, violent, wish-fulfilment fantasy.:::0:::2/4
The only edge here is in the title. This is indeed your father's thriller.:::0:::C
A conspiracy that extends to the highest levels of tedium and confusion.:::0:::None
The plotline... is so convoluted, it goes way past silliness; the big reveals are obvious, and by the time they come to fruition, suspense has long since leaked away.:::0:::2.5/5
Ray Winstone delivers the story's grim message to noir fans as if it were a bonbon on a tray: 'We all know what the facts are. We live a while, and then we die sooner than we'd planned.':::1:::3/4
Campbell adopts such a slow, ponderous approach to the material that you're sound asleep before any of the particulars sink in.:::0:::D
[Gibson's] steady, sobering performance goes a long way toward distracting from the movie's schlocky plotting and unimaginative construction.:::0:::3/5
Without action, compelling characters or a coherent point of view, Edge of Darkness doesn't have a glimmer of good qualities.:::0:::1.5/4
Gibson is willing to embrace the chance to be this generation's Charles Bronson.:::1:::2.5/4

After 7.5 years in which his only starring role involved a drunken traffic stop, Mel Gibson returns -- and he's the same old Mel. (Emphasis on the word "old."):::1:::2.5/4
In the end, all the plotting is basically thrown out the window anyway to focus on a gun-toting Gibson hunting down the people who've wronged him. - NERVE.COM:::0:::None
Edge of Darkness isn't a great film but it's crisply efficient one that's almost always engrossing...Gibson has fire in his eye and gravel in his Bahston accent.:::1:::None
The film's populist avenger is quintessential Gibson.:::1:::3/4
Disappointingly neutered in its own right, but considering the talent and material involved it's almost heart breaking:::0:::None
That inner pool of feral rage and icy intensity Gibson routinely dips into has more than enough liquid left for one last dunk, even if it's in service of a role Gibson has explored countless times before.:::1:::2.5/4
Edge of Darkness' moments of tension and excitement arrive in so many fits and starts that it never comes together cohesively to make a palatable potboiler.:::0:::2.5/5
There's nothing especially edgy or dark, or darkly edgy, or even particularly twilit about Edge of Darkness, at least as thrillers go.:::0:::2/4
Gibson's character here is a man crazed with grief. But it looks as if Gibson is just using that as an excuse to act crazy, period.:::0:::None
No longer quite so movie star handsome, Gibson's deeply lined features and thinning mane complement a performance that is finely tuned and textured -- mournful, cunning, determined and explosive with rage.:::1:::3/4
Mr. Gibson's performance is certainly intense, but the gleeful energy he once brought to such hits as Lethal Weapon -- or even to Conspiracy Theory, an excellent flop -- has turned toxic, and his somber scourge is no fun at all.:::0:::None
Gibson hasn't had a starring role in seven years, but he has no trouble returning to work. That he looks a little wearier, and a lot older, simply adds to his character's pathos.:::1:::3/5
Gibson nicely underplays the role of the father/cop/extremely crabby guy, but then why wouldn't he? He's done it about a dozen times before.:::0:::2/4
If Payback and Ransom dated and had a child it would be called Edge of Darkness. Gibson and Winstone shine in this revenge film with a purpose.:::1:::3.5/5
With Clint Eastwood seemingly retiring from the acting game, it's good to still have at least one aging, scowling badass who isn't afraid to unleash the righteous thunder:::1:::B-
Edge of Darkness is entertaining.:::1:::3/5
Complicated and stupid, a waste of Mel's considerable talents and worse, a waste of your time.:::0:::2.5/5
[S]uprisingly underpowered, a plodding police procedural that thinks that holding back on 'action' makes it 'serious' even in the absence of anything substantial to take its place...:::0:::None

Parental Content Review:::1:::None
Both Tom and the man who plays him seem intent on expiating some transgression.:::1:::B
There are few things worst than a film that has entire scenes, characters and events that roam freely like feral orphans, abandoned by the plot. Edge of Darkness is replete with them.:::0:::5/10
Works simultaneously as a taut action-thriller, an engrossing murder mystery, and an evocative statement on the dark side of big business and governmental politicking.:::1:::3/4
A byzantine plot sinks the movie.:::0:::C+
Not only is Edge of Darkness Gibson's best work in a decade -- a big improvement over such drivel as What Women Want -- it is a well-crafted thriller.:::1:::3/4
Feels condensed and convoluted, with too many cheap shortcuts to tie things together.:::0:::2/5

A crime drama that's exciting in the moment and that lingers in the mind.:::1:::3/4
Is this a drama about a father's loss? No. Is this a political thriller? Maybe, but a good thriller should consistently surprise the viewer. The movie's revelations are met with a resounding "duh.":::0:::1.5/4
This crisp, gripping drama of brutal criminal intrigue and sinister moral violence is smart and absorbing in its every nuance, and Gibson dominates the elaborate action with an assured performance that's as authoritative as it is affecting.:::1:::3.5/4
While it's not quite a return to form, the film is welcome comeback vehicle for Gibson.:::1:::None
A dark, brooding 'Death Wish'-style melodrama that aims for the complexity of a good political thriller but doesn't quite achieve it.:::0:::C
His face lined by life, he's (Gibson) more Murtaugh now then Riggs.:::1:::3/4
It's been nearly eight years since his last starring role onscreen, but fans needn't worry: Mel Gibson still has the makings of a formidable action star.:::1:::3/4
Gibson remains -- despise or defend him -- a uniquely fascinating screen presence as our shattered hero.:::1:::2.5/4
Perhaps "perversely watchable" might be the right term to describe the film.:::0:::2/4
You've seen it, but it's still entertaining...a well-made genre-blender by professionals who know how to coax tears, deliver thrills.:::1:::None
Mel Gibson looks battered and lined and tired ... but that serves him well in this brutal, paranoid thriller, a perfect role and strong comeback for the one-time mega-star.:::1:::3/4
A long, complicated affair that has its moments but suffers from an overwrought plot.:::0:::2.5/4
The plot complications involving nuclear waste and political maneuvering have been trivialized beyond all meaning. But watching Gibson in a revenge fantasy feeds all my needs for a bloodlusting B-movie feast.:::1:::2.5/4
The pace is languorous, the volume (with the exception of three or four jolting episodes of violence) low, the lighting dim and grim.:::0:::2.5/4
Somber with a supernatural dimension, this tense thriller doesn't catapult the viewer into the dark as brusquely as you might anticipate.:::1:::None
It's unusually well-written for a bloody actioner, and has unexpected layers.:::1:::B+
Edge Of Darkness quickly devolves into another showcase for Gibson's snorting-bull act, a routine he could happily have shelved during his time off.:::0:::C
Love him or loathe him, the Melster still has screen presence. That's why he's a star.:::1:::2.5/4
Gibson, who has always been an undervalued actor, does a sturdy job as a grieving dad who still engages in conversations with his dead child; it's almost a letdown when he puts aside his mourning sickness and spirals into melodrama.:::1:::None
The showdown with Gibson almost singlehandedly saves the movie -- almost:::0:::3/5
An uneasy translation, and while there's an undeniably perverse pleasure in watching Gibson mow down baddies once again, the film as a whole doesn't form a narrative convincing enough to support such action cinema luxuries.:::0:::C
It's a middling comeback, tentative, wary of much, and a fascinating portrait of a Hollywood icon doing his best to tiptoe back into the audience's good graces. And Gibson, a blue-eyed charmer to the bitter end, almost manages it.:::0:::2/5
This is easily one of the best films of Mel Gibson's career and his performance is right on target.:::1:::9/10
Kill someone's only child, and what do you have? You have a righteous avenger role almost too well-suited for Gibson's persona.:::1:::3/4
Gibson is a credible, attractive hero, as he has always been, so if you want fast-food action, here's your movie.:::0:::2.5/4
Gibson roots Craven in credible middle-aged fatigue as if to prove he's a truer artist than his haters claim.:::1:::None
Edge of Darkness has earned its January release date -- this movie deserves to be dumped into theaters with little fanfare.:::0:::2/4
Fairly solid thriller with a strong performance from Gibson and some nice directorial touches, though die-hard fans of the TV series are advised to steer clear.:::0:::3/5
Mel is at the top of his game as the T-1000 of angry, grieving fathers:::1:::4/5
Acting in his first film since 2003 Mel Gibson is a bit rusty...:::0:::C
How did this canny, savvy performer get roped into such a dud for his big acting comeback?:::0:::1/4
Mel Gibson shines in this kind of role, and he's at his very best in this politically charged thriller about a veteran homicide detective who goes after the murderers of his 24 year old daughter.:::1:::3/5
A flatfooted but surprisingly agile trenchcoat thriller.:::1:::7/10
A flawed thriller, to be sure, but the kind of edgy, captivating kind with great cast and production values that I go to the movies for.:::1:::4/5
The film depends on Gibson's performance, and he comes through.:::1:::3.5/5
As compressed and updated by screenwriters William Monahan and Andrew Bovell, it's just a conventional, divertingly propulsive, borderline boilerplate corporate-high-jinks thriller.:::1:::B
Gibson tries on a Boston accent (it needs work) and boringly underplays his character before the inevitable "Mad Mel" makes his appearance in the third act.:::0:::2/4
Gibson expresses a grief that is heartbreaking.:::1:::None
The most interesting component to this Mel Gibson vehicle happens off screen. This movie is a totally thrill-less thriller.:::0:::None
A top-notch thriller ... a well-crafted addition to a genre that has made a refreshing and welcome comeback in recent years.:::1:::8/10
Mel Gibson desperately needs a good movie. His fans need to see him in one. I am sorry to report that Edge of Darkness is not it.:::0:::3.5/4
There's more emphasis on bloodlust than grief -- a shame considering the mini's most powerful moments explored Craven's deeply conflicted agony.:::1:::3/5
Gibson still knows what he does best, as a star should, and creates tension just from never letting the tears poised in his eyes fall.:::1:::None
There's undeniable catharsis -- albeit an ugly, somewhat unsettling catharsis -- in Edge of Darkness.:::1:::None
A shot that defiantly fixes on Mel Gibson's balding pate from behind is the only evidence of the volatile actor-director's famous penchant for cinematic self-flagellation here.:::0:::1.5/4
It is an engrossing and thoughtful film that balances bullets and blood with moments of introspection and musings about the nature of family.:::1:::None
An intense Mel Gibson performance anchors this brutally effective crime thriller.:::1:::None
Although its paranoid trappings about nuclear weapons and radiation are more fitting to the eighties than today, Campbell's new Edge Of Darkness is a taut adult thriller.:::1:::None
Kevin Kline's tour de force, a performance of uncommon joie de vivre.:::1:::3/4
A typical Sundance type comedy that confuses quirkiness with humor. Needless to say, it stars Paul Dano in his typically weird character role. A totally annoying film.:::0:::None
Belly laughs are few and far between but the overarching tone of silliness deftly underscored by the human experience makes for a largely fulfilling cinematic experience.:::1:::4/5
Kevin Kline, who has a gift for this kind of characterization, heads up a talented trio of actors, all playing extremely quirky characters who are borderline pathological, but funny and harmless.:::1:::B
The pic becomes too bent out of shape by so many kooks sharing the spotlight.:::1:::B-
Harrison's life is a quest only for pleasure, and Kline and Dano definitely provide it, even if their arc is short and shallow. See it for Kevin.:::1:::4/5
I did a lot of squirming with this one.:::0:::2/4
[A] drearily quirky mess.:::0:::None
I loved Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini's The Extra Man, but it's not going to be to everyone's liking.:::1:::4.5/5
The episodic script is all verve and no wit, a relentless tribute to nonconformity that starts to exhaust its goofiness after the first hour.:::0:::C+
While directors Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini are busy tipping their caps to their favorite literary figures, they seem to forget their obligation to good movie-making.:::0:::2/4
Too clever for its own good, this film moves abruptly between serious drama and broad comedy.:::0:::None
...so full of improbabilities (you begin to wonder if anyone connected with the film has actually been to New York) that the whole experience just becomes wearying.:::0:::3/10
An entertaining kinky kick of a movie, a lightweight delight about dreamers and dilettantes.:::1:::B
"Extra Man" is a loving ode to the eccentrics of New York, and a wish that even in today's Disneyfied Manhattan, the city will always make room for the weirdos, too.:::1:::3.5/4
The Extra Man is a disappointment coming from Berman and Pulcini, whose American Splendor was an imaginative biopic about the late comic-book author Harvey Pekar.:::0:::2.5/4
As paltry and unsubstantial a film as The Extra Man is, I cannot find it within myself to completely resist its charms. The reason can be summed up in two incandescent words: Kevin Kline.:::0:::5/10
The movie sags whenever Kline is offscreen, and when he's on screen, his presence and his character take over completely -- something that the filmmakers, and certainly Dano, did not intend.:::0:::C
Dano and Kline are very fine performers. So why is this comedy such a chore? The answer appears to be whimsy overload.:::0:::1.5/4
Flies one freak flag too many.:::0:::None
Swifter comedic timing and a clearer narrative thread might have helped center this peculiar adaptation of Jonathan Ames's 1998 novel of the same name. Then again, maybe not.:::0:::2/4
Easily the plot of a vulgar comedy or something with absolutely no meaning, The Extra Man is dark, funny and thoughtful all at once.:::1:::None
The worst movie I have seen this year.:::0:::0/4
A fairly unnecessary, if harmless, rehash of the standard New York City coming-of-age tale complete with an eccentric, unreliable mentor.:::0:::None
Pulcini & Berman's work cuts its own path through the archetypes and delivers a unique comedy in the process.:::1:::None
The Extra Man is a comedy, but the humor is so genteel and smug it's as if the movie thinks it would be rude for us to laugh.:::0:::2/4
Lays on the eccentricity too thick and winds up seeming incredibly affected.:::0:::C-
Some actors are dinner. Kevin Kline is dessert, and his comic brio saves the film version of The Extra Man from its limitations.:::1:::2.5/4
The movie aggressively pushes its whimsicality to the point where it feels less whimsical than just aggressive.:::0:::2.5/4
Filled with odd behavior and curious quirks. What it's not filled with are recognizable humans.:::0:::2.5/5
Adapted from the Jonathan Ames novel, the film is too precious around the edges, but it gets somewhere.:::1:::3/5
Kevin Kline tends to give bravura performances even when he's not playing bravura characters.:::1:::B
I liked it enough to say rent it.:::1:::None
I felt the whole movie was kind of mannered and labored.:::0:::None
Henry is a man who knows how to live, and Kline welcomes us into the Russian Tea Room of his mind.:::1:::None
Darlings, there's nothing quite so tragique as a boring eccentric.:::0:::1/4
It's relentlessly unwacky and even quietly subversive.:::1:::None
While corsets/fishnets fit as seamlessly as jackets/trousers worn by the hero, the feature format isn't tailor-made for novelist/tv writer Ames -- giving us vignettes rather than an arcing storyline.:::0:::4.5/10
Kline is his usual engaging self but it's a supporting role he's playing by virtue of the script, but also Mr. Dano's presence, in this potent charmer of a film.:::1:::None
Kline has a ball, while Dano turns in a pitch-perfect performance. He never mocks his character's desires, or undersells his fears.:::1:::3/5
The delightful premise of the film somehow becomes preposterous. It's a phenomenon in indie films I describe as "quirk overload.":::0:::2.5/5
The Extra Man not only gilds the flower, but then glues on sequins and forces it into cha-cha heels.:::0:::2/4
For all its flighty charms, The Extra Man never really lands.:::0:::2.5/5
goes about relating sincerely odd characters in a resoundingly ordinary way:::0:::2/5
Kline gives a wild, wonderful performance, reminiscent of his work on A Fish Called Wanda.:::1:::B-
Kline's performance as Henry -- regal in its classical stage pronunciations -- is clearly the best thing in the film. But the character still fails to resonate; Henry isn't much more than a bag of peculiarities.:::0:::None
A wonderfully quirky character-driven drama about friendship, sexual desire, and being a true gentleman.:::1:::4/5
In this maddeningly uneven film version of Jonathan Ames' acclaimed 1998 novel, Kevin Kline gives a master class in acting.:::0:::2/4
The Extra Man is a grating one-note comedy posing as something more.:::0:::None
Arrives in theaters just in time to be the perfect counterpoint to Hollywood's broader, dumber parade of eccentrics, Dinner for Schmucks.:::1:::3.5/5
"The Extra Man" has its more outre moments but is in general an enjoyable, pitch-perfect celebration of non-conformity. Kevin Kline is a delight.:::1:::B+
What feels enjoyably outre in the 1998 coming-of-age novel by Jonathan Ames feels oppressively outre in this deadened, literal adaptation.:::0:::C
Doesn't leave a lasting impression, despite a story that almost demands discomfort from the viewer. It's never openly engaging, but there's a certain mischief to the piece that pleases.:::1:::C+
Dano simply isn't a leading man. With his chinless bobblehead and voice that sounds like he's perpetually swallowing, Dano isn't someone you want to watch for an entire film.:::0:::None
The film knocks itself unconscious trying to be whimsical and offbeat, but is so contrived that it is as embarrassing as it is unfunny.:::0:::1/4
The movie you were hoping to avoid.:::0:::2/5
Going below the surface, the filmmakers and the cast (including a marvelous performance by Marian Seldes as an osteoporotic doyenne) successfully create the hardest characters to pull off: exotic yet recognizable New Yorkers.:::1:::None
Like Kevin Kline's ridiculously pretentious Harrison, the film fancies itself much more interesting than it is.:::0:::1.5/4
Potentially delicious tale of flamboyant Upper East Side walker on the skids and the innocent young aspiring writer he wrangles as a roommate is too broadly played and unfocused to click.:::0:::None
Much of The Extra Man concerns Henry, portrayed with relentless propulsion by Kevin Kline.:::1:::None
Kevin Kline is by far the best thing in this movie, which is otherwise so overloaded with oddball characters that it never finds an even keel.:::0:::2/5
More an exhibition of precious acting than an absorbing narrative.:::1:::B-
... mainstream moviemaking with indie colors and oddball edges just quirky enough not to offend.:::0:::None
"Mannd God remains strictly a bit player.:::0:::None
Eat Pray Love isn't a bad movie -- just a spiritually dead one, wearing and wearying.:::0:::2.5/4
Too preachy, indulgent, and everybody cries. Even the extras.:::0:::None
Italians have a phrase -Che posso fare?- meaning "What can I do?" that's sometimes used when the answer is: "Nothing, just go with it." Lots of things happen in Eat Pray Love that only the lonely and book club members will understand. You just go with it.:::1:::B
:::1:::B-
:::0:::2/4
Perry aims high, and doesn't embarrass himself in tackling this iconic but dated play.:::1:::3/4
"For Colored Girls" features a lot of heartache and pain, but lacks any sense of purpose. It sacrifices depth for despair and suffers because of it.:::0:::0.5/5
Best" and "worst", "good" and "bad" are judgment calls that seem unusually difficult to apply here... [Tyler Perry's] strangest and most endlessly fascinating film.:::0:::5/10
Perry's awkwardly constructed screenplay and equally muddled direction is one 'metaphysical dilemma' not even these strong, and strongly gifted, women can conquer.:::0:::2/4
Tyler Perry movies certainly have their place in society, as they undoubtedly have a strong moral core and are made with noble intentions. On the evidence of For Colored Girls though, he should leave the serious drama alone.:::0:::2/5
Almost everyone in the cast is too talented for this.:::0:::1/5
It's refreshing to see an all black cast, in a film that places black women's stories front and centre; it's just a shame that the stories are such downers.:::0:::4/10
Director Tyler Perry has taken on a huge task in bringing Ntozake Shange's stage play For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf to the screen.:::1:::4/5
These performances are exceptional. While the structure of the film doesn't work very well, there is nothing at all wrong with the acting.:::1:::B
'For Colored Girls' doesn't do justice to the play it's based upon. However, the talent Tyler Perry has assembled here cannot be denied.:::1:::3/4
A slice-of-life soap opera on what it's like to be a black woman in America.:::0:::C
While gunning for the same empowering vibe as Waiting To Exhale, enduring this miserable effort from Tyler Perry is more like praying to expire.:::0:::1/5
Excruciating when it's bad, which is far too often, but a brave failure in lots of ways.:::0:::2/5
Perry crafts poorly paced soap opera, playing out in the most obvious and crass manner possible the situations that the poems subtly dance around. Shange's original text...:::0:::2/5
At least an interesting failure.:::0:::2/5
Tyler Perry's drama is beautifully acted but Ntozake Shange's multiple, interlocking narratives ultimately defy his efforts to bring them to the screen.:::0:::2/5
So thickly does Perry lay on the sanctimony and self-pity, you begin to wonder if it's all a spoof. Stick a Wayans brother in there and you could call it Tragic Movie.:::0:::2/5
Perry has assembled a formidable ensemble, including Loretta Devine, Kimberly Elise, Thandie Newton, Anika Noni Rose, Tessa Thompson, Kerry Washington, Whoopi Goldberg, Janet Jackson, Phylicia Rashad and, in the most searing cameo, Macy Gray.:::1:::B
Perry gives with one hand and takes with the other-the thrill of seeing these actresses "do their stuff" is decimated by Perry's insistence on welding a plot and adding "contemporary" additions to Shange's lyrical, timeless monologues.:::0:::None
Tyler Perry proves that he is even more ham-handed and cartoonish with drama than he is with his incredibly popular so-called comedies.:::0:::None
Tyler Perry goes art house with For Colored Girls -- and it's both alarming and wonderful to behold.:::1:::3.5/5
... women are good and the men are, almost all, bad. It is a cliche overdone and, unless you are a die hard Tyler Perry fan, should be missed.:::0:::C-
The basic plot and acting are good but those stilted monologues are entertainment killers.:::0:::5/10
Perry's weakness for the lowest common denominator transforms both anger and affirmation into sludge, not great poetic cinema like Spielberg's The Color Purple, Jonathan Demme's Beloved or Rodrigo Garcia's Mother and Child.:::0:::None
For Colored Girls is so shamelessly terrible it would make a great midnight hoot-fest, if you had the stomach to laugh at Shange or some of the best (and most underused) actresses of their generation...:::0:::None
... Tyler Perry at his best, delivering at last on his promise ...:::1:::4/5
Tyler Perry's ambitious adaptation charts the black female experience in America and tackles the big issues: rape, infidelity, murder, mental illness, loneliness.:::1:::B
[Perry] pulls off disturbing moments by finding conviction and vulnerability in his performers.:::1:::7/10
Once again, favoring melodrama over reality, Perry overextends his bounds and delivers a poorly filmed series of worst-case scenarios elevated to tolerable heights by a fantastic cast.:::0:::C-
Tyler Perry has Tyler Perried the hell out of this thing.:::0:::C-
Tyler Perry is the most influential African-American director since Spike Lee, and certainly the most financially successful ever, none of which can disguise that he's a terrible filmmaker.:::0:::D
Can a mid-'70s play consisting of 20 monologues delivered by seven women survive the transition to movie screens in 2010? The short answer: not if it's adapted by Tyler Perry.:::0:::1.5/4
The thought-provoking material about women paying a high price for making bad choices and ultimately finding their own voice may work on stage, but it's like putting a square peg in a round hole for a film.:::0:::2/4
Women may appreciate the message and sentiments expressed in Shange's words, but they would have been even more effective if incorporated into a stronger story.:::0:::5.5/10
An ambitious adaptation of an iconic feminist work and bold experiment for a straightforward filmmaker who's historically struggled to balance comedy with melodrama.:::0:::None
Ham-handed, obvious, overblown and pretentious, For Colored Girls is a plain disaster.:::0:::None
Director Tyler Perry's For Colored Girls is a bold example of an artist's reach exceeding his grasp. And it's hard not to applaud his determination and grade for ambition.:::1:::3/4
It has two undeniable virtues, however: Perry's bolder attitude as a writer and uniformly good work by his cast.:::1:::3.5/4
Tyler Perry melodrama deals with intense, disturbing themes.:::1:::3/5
Characters barely described in the play get turned into Tyler Perry cliches.:::0:::2/5
The entire film is suffocated by an inflated sense of self-worth - we are making a crucial movie of great pedigree about major underreported issues is the general attitude.:::0:::2/4
Any time [an actress] excels in a scene, its in spite of Perry's uninspired contributions behind the camera and not because of them.:::0:::1.5/4
It's not a perfect vehicle, but the one thing that stands out is the amazing acting by the ensemble. If anything, the performances outweigh whatever flaws one sees.:::1:::3/4
The movie ends with a group hug, but it takes date rape, STD's, a 'down-low' husband, teen pregnancy, girlfriend-beating, exorcism and even baby defenestration to get there.:::0:::2/4
Retains some of the inherent power of it source and features some strong performances in the process but never finds the narrative cohesion needed to translate it to modern movie audiences.:::0:::2.5/5
A veritable who's-who of A-list African-American actresses (Janet Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg) populates For Colored Girls, and their performances keep this highly theatrical script from suffocating the big screen.:::1:::B
Perry gets points for persistence, yes, and for ambition. But that's not enuf.:::0:::2/4
Shange's words retain their power despite the melodramatic incidents Perry has woven to fill in the spaces between poems, his flat, TV-style direction and the highly variable performances of an all-star cast.:::0:::1.5/4
"For Colored Girls" may, in fact, be Perry's best film (not saying a lot, I know). It's certainly his first bid, as a director, for art-house respectability.:::0:::1/4
While these two hours of hopelessness seem to argue that being an inner city black woman is the unluckiest roll of the dice, these ladies - even at their weakest - carry themselves with the confidence of winners, and we cling to their strength.:::0:::3/5
The film is a mawkish mess, only occasionally alleviated by the performances or Shange's poetry.:::0:::1/4
[Tyler Perry] sings the song the way he likes it - with force, feeling and tremendous sincerity.:::1:::3.5/5
As often as Perry's melodramatic storytelling hits the mark (Thandie Newton's performance), it misses at least as often (Whoopi Goldberg's).:::0:::2/4
Perry uses a very heavy hand to create melodrama when the material is dramatic enough.:::1:::2.5/4
Loopy, ill-paced, but often endearing, For Colored Girls owes everything to its powerhouse stable of actresses who manage to grab at the heart of Shange's words and lift the film past its flaws.:::1:::3/5
It's better to reach for the stars and not always succeed than to lazily play it safe, and For Colored Girls is nothing if not courageous.:::1:::3/4
...a series of filmed speeches studded with horrific bits of drama (for which Aaron Zigman's score is turned to 11), but the actors keep much of it afloat.:::0:::C+
The film is repetitive, monotonous and, like its source's title, goes on way too long.:::0:::B-
These words and these stories may still resonate with any woman who has struggled to love herself enough to expect and deserve love from others.:::1:::B-
Shows a mastery of tone, a capacity to elicit strong performances and also to bring out different colors within those performances so that, when it all comes together, it's not the same note sounding over and over. This is smart, lovely work.:::1:::4/4
Perry's ambition in translating the work to the screen is determined and true; the film's main fascination is that of watching a director struggle to honor Shange's choreopoem and then lose the battle not with the material but with himself.:::0:::6.5/10
The writer/director behind the exceedingly broad comedy of the Madea franchise approaches the hit 1970s Ntozake Shange play with a pragmatism that succeeds in form but not in function.:::0:::2/4
Fans of the original may be dismayed by his often-awkward adaptation, which turns too many of Shange's survivors into victims. But it's equally likely that his blunt, emotional approach -- using her words to create his own melodrama -- will connect ...:::1:::3/5
Monologues and melodrama rarely work in contemporary movies exploring social ills.:::0:::1.5/4
It is a film destined to polarize. Many will hate it. Hopefully more will love it, or at least allow room for it, for its raw brutality, its extremes, its difficult truths.:::1:::3.5/5
By casting a raft of magnetic actresses and focusing his work around their talents, Perry gives his film a power beyond the melodramatic twists and flat-footed dialogue.:::1:::3/5
Who could imagine, 35 years on, For Colored Girls would become a star-studded mess of a movie directed by a black, male Hollywood mogul?:::0:::2/4
Shange gives us archetypes; Perry trades in stereotypes.:::0:::2.5/4
For Colored Girls raises the question of whether Perry, having made more money than he could possibly spend, will now turn his attention to ever more challenging, if not so popular, stories and themes. If so, this film is a good first step.:::1:::2.5/4
The audience I saw it with didn't seem to know whether to clap when it was over or start taking Lipitor.:::0:::2.5/4
I used to think there was nothing worse in modern moviemaking than Perry's unfunny, incompetent stooping for profit. It turns out that when he boldly and blatantly panders for prestige, he reaches even newer lows.:::0:::0/5
daring, provocative, and a little arrogant:::1:::4/5
There's no right way to do an adaptation, particularly a difficult-to-adapt work like this, but there are plenty of wrong ways, and Perry's film offers a casebook of things-not-to-do.:::0:::C-
You have passages of great lyricism followed by somebody saying we should be "there for each other." Ouch.:::0:::C
No question, Perry's Girls is compelling and powerful. But it's also a missed opportunity, one that fails to fully capitalize on mostly terrific performances and the story's timeless message.:::1:::B-
Perry benefits from the fire, heft, velocity, and lyricism of the language, but he also updates the material and makes it work onscreen, eliciting powerhouse performances from an ensemble of actresses.:::1:::None
Perry never solves the stage-to-screen translation problem. But the path he has chosen is as intriguing as it is irksome, and it works better than you" is always likable. Indeed, the film works hard to be so. One longs, though, for a glimpse of the humanity behind the shtick and comic gestures. The film just never gets that intimate with its characters.:::0:::None
Although too devoted to matters literary, theatrical, operatic and sexually outre to make it with general audiences, this adaptation of Jonathan Ames' novel exudes the sort of smarts and sophisticated charm specialized audiences seek.:::1:::None
A deeply goofy comedy set in a world of weirdoes which boasts one of Kevin Kline's funniest ever performances.:::1:::None
:::0:::2/4
:::1:::2.5/4
:::0:::None
:::0:::None
If you've ever had an awkward sexual moment in your life (admit it, you have), this is the movie for you. If you've ever believed there can't be love without the comedy, this is the movie for you.:::1:::None
Barrymore comfortably slips into more filthy talk and situations while bringing her innate sweetness and relatability.:::1:::3/4
You sort of wind up rooting for them in spite of their characters being somewhat knuckleheadish.:::0:::2.5/5
Going the Distance is concocted from a familiar formula. It just happens to be a really good example of what can be done with it.:::1:::B+
Much like Drew Barrymore, [this film] is so intent on being cutesy and bubbly that it's nauseating...:::0:::None
...the pervasively affable atmosphere [is] heightened by the palpable chemistry between Long and Barrymore's respective characters.:::1:::3/4
The combination of a very funny and a little bit raunchy rom-com with the plethora of extras make the package a must to rent or buy.:::1:::B+
Not a great film, but in a time when most romantic comedies are trite and predictable, this one at least tries to deal with an actual relationship hurdle.:::0:::2.5/4
...being different doesn't necessarily mean being better.:::0:::4/10
Sex, drugs and F-bombs on the first date...ah, modern romance...:::0:::C
An original film that gets it right when it comes to exploiting both love and laughs.:::1:::4.5/5
Going the Distance features the graduation of Justin Long from gawky supporting actor to gawky lead actor, and Drew Barrymore from cutesy rom-com star to cutesy rom-com star with a filthy mouth.:::1:::3/5
Burstein is a documentarian by training, and she milks an unforced honesty from the story.:::1:::3.5/4
Foul-mouthed and funny, 'Going the Distance' is a youthful romance for grownups.:::1:::3/4
Drew Barrymore and her boy toy try going bicoastal:::0:::C-
What are we doing watching this manically dreary, physically nauseating date movie from hell?:::0:::None
If you're looking for a fun date movie with realistic characters you can genuinely root for, see this film. Best rom-com of the year? Quite likely.:::1:::4/5
Feels too much like a shrugging shuffle around the bases. Scenes are overscored, there are more references to dicks than in a Judd Apatow boxset, and the story's too episodic, with little tension other than will-they-stay-together?:::0:::None
the sequences in which Barrymore and Long share screen time are not as good as when they're separated, which lets some of the air out of their romance:::0:::2.5/4

A podcast with the writer of Going the Distance, Geoff LaTulippe.:::0:::None
A long haul.:::0:::2/5
While it mostly avoids rom-com cliches and is grown-up enough to deal with sex frankly, it's also deeply vanilla and is saved only by an obvious spark between the two leads.:::1:::3/5
Doesn't go the whole distance. But it's a start.:::1:::3/5
The only reason you root for a reunion at the end of this unromantic romp is because these two jerks really deserve each other.:::0:::1/4
Absolutely infuriating. The worst movie of the year.:::0:::None
Sweet without being sticky and with just enough sourness to keep things real, this is a romantic comedy that delivers in both departments.:::1:::4/5
The film has its share of laughs -- by my count, seven titters and three chuckles.:::0:::2/5
Cliches aside, this has a fresh, contemporary feel, and the cosy rapport between Barrymore and Long (on/off partners in real-life) makes it an easy ride.:::1:::3/5
Barrymore and Long are likable, but they aren't likable enough to pull off this screenplay.:::0:::2.5/5
What's both refreshing and problematic is that there's no emotional imbalance between boy and girl: their feelings are mutual and the obstacle is purely geographical.:::1:::3/5
There's not much substance to a thin and rather contrived plot, but there are lots of laugh-out-loud lines -- at least to start with.:::1:::3/5
Barrymore and Long have a way of bringing out the silliness in each other and luckily, that kind of chemistry goes a long way.:::1:::3/5
While it's unlikely to be anyone's long-term love, if you're up for a fun, quick fling, it does the trick.:::1:::3/5
A feelgood breeze kept fresh by winning performances, it's worth going the extra mile for.:::1:::3/5
Watchable romcom, enlivened by a frequently funny script and strong comic performances from a superb cast, though the script can't quite resolve the problems raised by real life long-distance relationships...:::1:::3/5
A raunchy rom-com that is surprisingly authentic in its emotions and hilariously obscene.:::1:::3.5/5
Sometimes it's sweet, sometimes it's sappy, sometimes it's unbelievably raunchy and occasionally it's rather witty, but none of it melds together particularly well. Often, it's like watching five different movies crammed into one.:::0:::C
The movie doesn't know whether it wants to be sweet or dirty - Nora Ephron or Judd Apatow:::1:::6/10
Enjoyable, but good, not great.:::1:::3/4
A charming, but ultimately forgettable romantic comedy. At least this time, there's no sperm donor involved.:::1:::3/5
Drew Barrymore and Christina Applegate are tremendously appealing: it's not long before you're wishing Going the Distance was about them.:::0:::None
...it doesn't treat its female lead as if she's an idiot whose professional success is simply proof how inadequate she is without a man.:::1:::3.5/5
This is the best of the romantic comedy genre since '(500) Days of Summer.':::1:::9/10
Whoever thought they could mix gross toilet-humor and endless vulgarity with romance has done a big injustice to these otherwise likeable lead stars.:::0:::1.5/5
It might not be particularly original, but this rom-com at least takes a fresh approach to the formula.:::1:::3.5/5
An uneven, painfully contrived and uninspired romantic comedy that's low on laughs and chemistry while high on awkward dirty talk and unnecessary foul language.:::0:::4.90/10
'Going the Distance' is an occasionally diverting look at long-distance relationships that takes a few too many shortcuts.:::0:::2.5/5
a crass excuse for a film:::0:::1/5
Edgy Barrymore romcom has lots of sex, language.:::1:::3/5
As a riotous comedy, Distance falls short, but it still racks up several miles for sweetness.:::1:::B-
Romcom - like everything else in this text-happy society - is two words shortened and bonded together. If only the movie was chopped and shortened.:::0:::2.5/5
All the bases seem to be covered, but none of them are particularly funny. At best you'll smile out loud.:::0:::None
Z-z-z-z-z-z-z, we must say.:::0:::2/5
LaTulippe keeps things moving by maintaining the tension these two people, who seem to be perfect for each other, have in not wanting to choose between love and career, with them wisecracking,weeping and being blindsided by their emotional rollercoaster:::1:::4/5
The film's constant raunch factor balances out its romantic center in a way that will likely surprise and please many.:::1:::B
If Drew Barrymore and Justin Long have as much fun being romantically involved in real life as they do on screen, they should be together for a long time.:::1:::None
Barrymore just keeps getting better with age, both with her looks and her comedic timing --- and the writing soars above the commonplace.:::1:::None
[T]ries too hard to be cute, and the desperation -- "Please like me!" the movie is practically screaming -- becomes a turnoff.:::0:::None
Plays like the work of soulless hacks who put a conventional romantic-comedy script through some sort of Judd Apatow computer program before enacting it for the cameras.:::0:::0.5/4
A rom-combo of frat boy humor, generic romance and career angst, underscoring a sex commuter comedy with lovers flying across the country for visits. All that's missing is some snakes on a plane.:::0:::4/10
The raison d'etre of Going the Distance is exploring long-distance relationships. What a shame, then, that it has nothing much to say on the subject that isn't completely obvious.:::0:::2/4
Hilarious in many individual scenes. It's the first movie I can ever remember being less than the sum of its parts.:::1:::2.5/4
A surprisingly funny movie. It's not great, not by a long shot. But it made me laugh on a much more regular basis than I expected.:::1:::None
Self-conscious and filled with coarse vulgarity, as a romantic comedy, it's a disappointment.:::0:::5/10
Long and Barrymore create very realistic chemistry in a film that pretty much nails what's it like to be in a long distance relationship. Though, Charlie Day steals the movie.:::1:::3/5
Documentary filmmaker Nanette Burstein brings a refreshing frankness to the goings-on (you don't see many rom-coms where people do bong hits on their first date and aren't punished for it), and the leads are awfully winning.:::1:::3/5
A wan romantic comedy about the difficulties inherent in long-distance relationships and touches on every cliche in the handbook.:::0:::1.5/5
Particularly forgettable.:::0:::1/4
Acknowledges both the difficulty and the comic potential of the arrangement, and does so with enough insight and charm to make you wonder why frequent-flier love is not a more popular theme in romantic comedies.:::1:::3.5/5
It's not exactly re-inventing the wheel but it's still a pleasant surprise.:::1:::7/10
As chances are dim that we may see another romantic comedy as funny and as close to honest as this all year, we should celebrate Going the Distance while we have the chance.:::1:::3/4
The entire cast consists of able-bodied comedians, and a great deal of the movie has been improvised, so the laughs keep coming.:::1:::3/4
It's heartless and soulless, flimsy and formulaic.:::0:::C-
(This) funny-but-forgettable movie loses its way somewhere between stowing the carry-on and returning the tray tables to the locked position.:::0:::2/4
It's filthy, funny and kind of sweet, if not quite up to the level of Judd Apatow's oeuvre in the burgeoning field of R-rated comedies with heart.:::1:::2.5/4
It smothers the already frail story of their characters' long-distance relationship with enough R-rated gross-out humor for half a dozen Judd Apatow movies -- except that virtually none of it is funny.:::0:::1/4
It's a solid but totally forgettable entertainment, redeemed somewhat by Barrymore's loud, horsey laugh and some agreeably racy comic situations.:::1:::None
Justin Long and Drew Barrymore have a believable chemistry that makes Going the Distance worth going to. More or less.:::1:::2.5/4
This empty, immature romantic comedy ultimately feels as if it's filled with all the hot air that separates New York and San Francisco, yet still manages to be a suffocating bore.:::0:::1.5/5
The laughs kept me involved in Going the Distance, but after I left the theater, it occurred to me that this slight comedy hadn't gone very far at all.:::0:::2/4
... amiable enough thanks to the two stars, here at their most likeable ...:::1:::3/5
Most rom-coms are fairy tales from start to finish; this one shows that you can keep things down-to-earth and still have a completely satisfying resolution.:::1:::B+
The long distance aspect was interesting, accurate, and mined for maximum comic effect.:::1:::B
Going the Distance occupies a happy medium where we don't necessarily really live, but like to think we could. In short, it's better than you're expecting.:::1:::3.5/5
A reminder of what the genre can accomplish when it stays true to a premise that actually has relevance to and basis in reality.:::1:::3.5/4
While it takes its sweet time in doing the titular thing, 'Going the Distance' has enough charm and laughs to warrant a recommendation. (Parental Review also Available):::1:::None
It's about time someone made a romantic comedy about long distance relationships. The set-up is ripe with both comic and dramatic possibilities, dueling polarities that Going the Distance mines equally.:::1:::7/10
May not exactly rock the conventions of the rom-com, but it is a refreshingly vibrant addition to the genre:::1:::None
One of the things I liked best about the film is how it is grounded in the grim economics of the newspaper and recording industries.:::1:::B+
Might be the most honest and accomplished romantic comedy so far this year.:::1:::3/4
They're either trying to copy someone else's personality or they mistakenly think they're being original. At least they don't have sex with bras on. That's realistic.:::0:::None
The best news about the script is that it avoids the usual rom-com staples of misunderstandings and incompetence.:::1:::B-
A relationship movie in which the f-bomb gets dropped about once a minute and the screen is dotted with bare derrieres (male).:::0:::2/4
Captures the harshness and the sweetness of our time.:::1:::4/4
Going The Distance offers up a genuine, well-observed romance that is often very funny and profane.:::1:::None
The conflict is unsatisfying and its resolution moot.:::0:::4/10
Going the Distance is a reminder of the sorry state of the rom-com, where gross scenes and easy-to-write trash talk have replaced smart dialogue.:::0:::1.5/4
This premise, with better writing, could have made a much more compelling movie.:::0:::None
An R-rated romance that has its moments but is ultimately trying a little too hard (something Barrymore, with her trademark lightness, never does).:::0:::2.5/4
A foul-mouthed rom-com carved from Apatowian intent, but it feels more like a sketch of a movie than the real thing.:::0:::1.5/4
The novelty of seeing Barrymore and Long onscreen together wears off quickly, and then the picture has to work on its own merits -- which, unfortunately, are few.:::0:::1.5/4
There's rat-a-tat dialogue in "Going the Distance," but it's kept small-caliber, and the film does not kid itself -- or us -- about how much hard work is required to keep a flickering flame of feeling alive in the face of a big, cold world.:::1:::3.5/5
The film gets many things so right about the conflicts faced by a two-career couple looking for work in a shrinking economy.:::1:::2.5/4
There's just not quite enough to the movie: not enough jokes, not enough obstacles, not enough sex.:::0:::None
In the end, the movie feels confused, conflicted and muddled. It winds up pleasing almost no one.:::0:::2/4
Between this movie and her fascinating performance in HBO's Grey Gardens, Barrymore, at 35, is becoming a serious comedic actor.:::1:::3/4
a standard-issue, relationship-thin rom-com that hopes its potty mouth will distance itself from the competition:::0:::1.5/5
Every time Going the Distance goes for the big dirty joke, the movie loses all rhythm. When it follows its heart, it works rather well.:::1:::3/5
Purists who say that modern romantic comedies are too often crude for the sake of being crude have fresh evidence in Going the Distance.:::1:::B-
It all looks so effortless, it's a wonder that movies like Going The Distance are such an anomaly.:::1:::B
Going The Distance doesn't redefine cinematic romance, but it balances the sweet and sour moments of its story very well.:::1:::3/5
There's also some gallows humor about the record and newspaper industries, but overall this is a light, genial comedy about denial and self-defense.:::1:::None
Barrymore and Long are both appealing, but not enough to sustain audience interest in the cinematic equivalent of dry-humping.:::0:::1.5/4
The couple-surrounded-by-quirky-friends dynamic is as obvious as the movie's New York locales and well-positioned indie band posters.:::0:::None
Going the Distance, a new romantic comedy from doco director Nannette Burstein, is pretty much wall to wall with dirty talk, but it doesn't seem to have a political or social point to make; which makes it feel a little empty.:::0:::2.5/5
There is not much substance to Geoff LaTulippe's screenplay, which mostly falls back on Apatow-style sex jokes and pop-culture riffs.:::0:::2.5/5
Going the Distance quickly picks up pace to become a lively, edgier-than-usual Hollywood comedy.:::1:::3/5
Going the Distance superficially resembles a genre film, but is hipper, edgier and about 40 I.Q. points higher than the average romantic comedy:::1:::3.5/4
Lest you think this is some sappy "chick flick," be warned: "Going the Distance" has a lot more in common with the raunchy male-bonding comedy "The Hangover" than it does with "You've Got Mail.":::1:::3/4
A little too obviously inspired by Judd Apatow's success at mixing romance and raunch ... confuses dirty with cool and improv-ready characters with real people.:::0:::2.5/5
An aspiring journalist and a music-industry slacker discover the many downsides of long-distance romance in this formulaic comedy, which relies too heavily on the charm of stars Drew Barrymore and Justin Long.:::0:::None
Screenwriter Geoff LaTulippe's story of a recession-era long-distance relationship and its hurdles takes its characters seriously.:::1:::3/4
If you've no frequent-flier miles, there's little need to go the distance with this bumpy ride.:::0:::1.5/4
In terms of tone and style, the finished product ends up all over the place: Think of it as the Sybil of romantic comedies.:::0:::2.5/5
The funniest, sweetest romantic comedy since (500) Days of Summer, Going the Distance feels blessedly relaxed.:::1:::3.5/5
Going the Distance is a truly modern romantic-gross-out-comedy.:::1:::3.5/5
Going the Distance may be a minor movie, but it's also the rare romantic comedy in which you can actually believe what you're seeing.:::1:::B+
Garrett and Erin meet cute over a game of Centipede, though their subsequent long-distance romance breeds mainly a desire to see them and their friends suffer Human Centipede-style torment.:::0:::1.5/4
The surprisingly vulgar humor is at odds with the story's sweetness, and smacks of trying too hard.:::0:::2/5
From the corny 'see what we did there?' title to a plot that's as predictable as a transatlantic flight-path, this is a truly join-the-dots romcom.:::0:::2/5
[It does] that one thing that a romance absolutely has to do -- touch us.:::1:::2/4
Just because you tart up a typical romantic comedy with trash talk doesn't make it edgy or real.:::0:::2/5
Coming in midway between 'Up in the Air' and 'Failure to Launch,' this comedy about a long-distance romance neither soars nor crashes and burns...not great and not terrible, just mediocre.:::0:::C
It doesn't have the emotion or tenderness of Burstein's American Teen, and where the LA Times predicted the next (500) Days Of Summer, we're left instead with a bog-standard chick-flick, as light and superficial as you'd usually expect.:::0:::2/5
To date, no motion picture has adequately captured the soaring highs and devastating lows associated with a long distance relationship, but Going the Distance comes as close as any movie has.:::1:::3/4
It's funny, I was just remarking to a friend the other day that more romantic comedies should make Hitler/Zyklon B references. Going the Distance, GET OUT OF MY HEAD!:::0:::D-
...it's simply the best romantic comedy of the year so far. It's adorable, of its time and laugh out loud funny.:::1:::B+
Nanette Burstein reminds us she was previously a director of documentaries by occasionally shooting with a handheld camera for no discernible reason.:::0:::None
The writing here is really quite endearing and Burstein's use of hand-held camera in several scenes helps add spontaneity to the proceedings that enlivens what could have been otherwise stale material.:::1:::None
While occasionally opting for cheap laughs, this romantic comedy is entertaining, warm and feels surprisingly rooted in real life.:::1:::None
And thus the romantic comedy slump continues.:::0:::C-
I'm surprised Barrymore and Long signed up for this gig. Perhaps the chance to work opposite each other was too irresistible. Either that, or the million-dollar pay cheques.:::0:::None
This kind of film all boils down to charm and both Long and Barrymore do an excellent job of playing people it's easy to actually like.:::1:::None
Evokes the sensation of witnessing a couple who think everything the other person does is superlatively amusing, but are insufferable to all around them.:::0:::2/5
Barrymore and Long are ado might expect.:::1:::None
For Colored Girls feels like the cinematic equivalent to putting a garish reproduction of the Sistine Chapel on the ceiling of your McMansion and calling it art.&#8232;:::0:::None
More Perry than Shange, and all the weaker for it.:::0:::C-
The appeal of the original went far beyond the specifics of being black or female, in the '70s or any time. The adaptation's limitations make the play seem quaint, out of date.:::0:::1.5/4
Perry has built a lucrative and beloved niche from films aimed specifically at black women, but none of those pictures bore the painfully theatrical artifice of For Colored Girls...:::0:::1/4
Perry tries to be faithful to the play and also to his own boldly and simply told stories, and the two styles don't fit together.:::0:::2.5/4
The centerpiece tragedy ... is so incompetently and appallingly staged that the film literally jumps the shark before your eyes -- no recovery is possible.:::0:::2/5
Perry has taken a groundbreaking, radical work of theater and turned it into just another cardboard Tyler Perry movie.:::0:::1/5
The actresses' quiet pain balances out [Perry's] penchant for exaggerated emotion.:::1:::None
The juiced up hysterics are exhausting and unyielding in their shrill tone, making a fool out of the original work, degrading sobering expressions of torment by turning the pain into Madea-slapped histrionics.:::0:::C
The film comes off as one long litany of lament and tragedy that never fits together.:::0:::2.5/5
[F]inally, Perry has made a film that doesn't pander, that has something meaningful to say -- something actually worth hearing -- and that is more than merely watchable...:::1:::None
This grave update of a 1975 play, which interweaves nine stories, wastes talents such as Janet Jackson and Thandie Newton.:::0:::None
The rich language of the ruminations are utterly disconnected from Perry's dialogue.:::0:::None
Opening up the play might work, if Perry's melodramatic intrusions contained a fraction of Shange's emotional dexterity. You can easily tell when her lovely words end and his clunky ones begin, so drastic is the difference.:::0:::B-
Perry has taken Shange's feminist word-and-movement portraits of disenfranchised African-American women and turned those howls into...a maddeningly choppy mess of a Tyler Perry movie.:::0:::C-
Saying that For Colored Girls is the most disciplined, least clownish film that Tyler Perry has made is faint praise indeed. And that's how it's meant.:::0:::None
[Perry has] made what amounts to a tone-deaf musical of women's hardships, one where stereotypes soliloquize rather than sing.:::0:::1.5/4
Herein lies an invitation for us all to move beyond victimhood ... and, in some cases, simply to get over ourselves.:::1:::3/5
Though striving for artistic legitimacy in bringing Shange's incomparable play to the screen, Perry indulges his worst instincts for melodrama in For Colored Girls, shoehorning her text into his own tawdry narrative.:::0:::None
Tyler Perry utterly butchers Ntozake Shange's theatrical tone poem to black female identity.:::0:::None
All that was missing was a pistol-packing granny in drag, chirrun!:::1:::3.5/4
For Colored Girls's undiluted hysteria would be completely obscene if it weren't so unintentionally hilarious.:::0:::1.5/4
Hovering between theater and cinema, sociology and melodrama, poetry and narrative, Perry's version of the noted play lacks subtlety, seldom finding the right tone to stir emotions through the the women's monologues.:::0:::C
Though the text of the playwright's most affecting poems is virtually intact, Perry has unmistakably wrestled Girls into the same soap-opera mold of his earlier pics.:::0:::None
Looking to dramatize the daily hardships of African-American women by focusing on nine diverse black females living in Harlem, this melodrama drowns in soap-opera theatrics.:::0:::None
:::1:::3/5
rable together.:::1:::4/5
Romantic comedies aren't written any more. They're compiled - cut and pasted together from bits and pieces of old Judd Apatow and Nora Ephron bromances and chick flicks.:::0:::2.5/5
Be prepared to be underwhelmed by this contrived romantic comedy that falls as flat as the dining room table on which Drew Barrymore and Justin Long make out:::0:::None
The funny stuff is canceled out by too many story-intensive stretches, which dispense with the humor and make the movie feel as long as Braveheart.:::0:::2.5/4
A grittier, saltier than usual rom-com populated with laughs, smarts and a couple you can root for.:::1:::3/5
Helmer Nanette Burstein comes from documentaries and so the film is more grounded in realistic detail, but as a comedy, it's rather flat and neither funny nor insightful enough about its subject.:::0:::C
Manages to be interesting as well as amusing, and there are good performances from both Drew Barrymore and Justin Long at the core of it.:::1:::3.5/5
This potentially thoughtful, poignant relationship film quickly loses its nerve.:::0:::None
Barrymore goes from Grey Gardens to this mess. I wanted all the characters to die violent deaths.:::0:::None
It's hard to imagine any romantic comedy going wrong in so many different ways.:::0:::None
A bicoastal comedy with a bit of a bipolar disorder.:::0:::None
I'm Still Here is incredibly self indulgent and pointless. As a piece it is not funny, and simply put, it's just painful to watch and offers very little.:::0:::2/10
Joaquin gets the last laugh on us all. But the movie's a mess.:::0:::1.5/4
As a defeated Phoenix cleanses himself in the waters of Panama at the movie's climax, ultimately you're left asking the same question you were wondering when you went in: why should I care?:::0:::2/5
Is I'm Still Here an art film? Post-verite? Social satire? A big "**** you" to Hollywood? Disturbing? Hard to sit through? Oh yeah.:::0:::None
[A] disaster, a bratty, self-indulgent demand to be paid attention to, complete with the expectation that it will be paid attention to, because celebrity simply really is that irresistible no matter what it's doing...:::0:::None
If what's happening in the film is honest and real, it's more spectacle than introspection. If it's all fake, only the filmmakers are laughing.:::0:::1.5/4.0
This movie has to be seen to be simultaneously believed and disbelieved.:::1:::B+
By the end of the film, I was hoping it was a fake. If real, it would reveal a famous person who should not be celebrated.:::1:::B
An ugly and disturbing deconstruction of self-destruction and emptiness.:::0:::3/10
Phoenix and Affleck aren't merely concerned with teaching everyone a lesson -- that would be cheap. They offer us an opportunity to step through the looking glass and see the human being that sits behind the famous personality.:::1:::4.5/5
If Phoenix and Affleck are engaged in an extended performance-art piece, their message ? that America?s celebrity culture is empty and soul-crushing ? isn?t anything that hasn?t been said before.:::0:::0/4
A clever stunt that shrewdly wrestles with issues of fame, truth and self.:::1:::B
Taken as satire, where Phoenix is the Trickster, I'm Still Here is a rare piece of provocation cinema, infiltrating the mainstream and casting an ugly light on a torrid, superficial society.:::1:::None
Phoenix needs a hug. And a Bowflex.:::0:::2/4
Casy Affleck is trying to claim that I'm Still Here is 'gonzo film-making'. And I'm right with him on that point. It DOES look like it was made by a muppet.:::0:::1/5
...it took something like courage to make it, and it has some ofthe same iconoclastic power of punk rock, with the same edge of sneering cynicism ballasted by a canny sense of the market.:::0:::83/100
I don't get it.:::0:::1/5
What Affleck and Phoenix have attempted is more than a film. I'm Still Here chronicles a two-year performance-art piece that's bold and, just maybe, brilliant.:::1:::None
I'm Still Here's gruelling faux-doc assemblage loses its charm after about 40 minutes.:::0:::2/5
Why leave all that wreckage in their path if there's no real point; no insightful takeaway?:::0:::1.5/4
Neither a verite portrait of an actor in decline, nor simply a hoax, but instead a diverting piece of Method-inspired performance art.:::1:::None
And if it's all an act, some kind of meta-commentary on celebrity and public life? In that case, it's just boring.:::0:::C
Self-indulgent? Definitely. Funny? Mostly. Real? It actually doesn't matter.:::1:::3/5
The result is intriguing, fitfully amusing and terribly sad because if the story was for real then it has left Phoenix a laughing stock and a broken man.:::1:::3/5
The truth doesn't hurt. Despite the fact we now know that Phoenix hasn't lost the plot, I'm Still Here is still an amazing piece of cinema.:::1:::4
Affleck's meta-satire riffs amusingly on celebrity culture without hitting too many faux-doc highs.:::1:::3/5
A bizarre documentary that proves seeing is not necessarily believing.:::1:::B
Not entertaining at all, regardless of whether you believe it or not. It comes across as a bunch of talentless high school kids making a home-grown version of Jackass:::0:::1/5
No doubt what we witness is a performance for the camera, but with what motivation? Or is the hoax a hoax?:::0:::1/4
The revelation the whole thing was a sham cannot repair the damage Joaquin Phoenix has done to a once-promising career. I'm Still Here is a practical joke, and not a very good one, either in conception or execution.:::0:::2/5
Dear The Academy Awards, please give Joaquin Phoenix and Casey Affleck their Oscars now please. One of the most riveting pieces of entertainment this year!:::1:::4.5/5
Maybe "I'm Still Here" tells the truth, in the sense that it shows us Phoenix's unhappy personal view of the life behind the velvet rope that he's rejected.:::1:::3/4
Is this cinema verite or a satire of celebrity self-regard? If this is 'Borat' in extremis, is its portrait of an artist in anguish any less legitimate? Ultimately, the film is more interesting to discuss than to watch.:::0:::2/4
It's one thing to pull off a hoax; it's quite another to transform the fakery into authentic entertainment.:::0:::2/5
I'm Still Here is amateurishly shot and edited, as if ineptness equaled some higher level of veracity. Ironically, it's the only Joaquin Phoenix movie anyone has cared about in years.:::0:::F
Joaquin Phoenix gives the performance of a lifetime. Funny, tragic, compulsive and utterly one of a kind, you must see this film.:::1:::5/5
Casey Affleck's I'm Still Here is, in and of itself, the perfect metaphor for the cult of celebrity - alternately compelling, repugnant, fuelled by pretension and ego and fake as a $3 bill.:::0:::None
It is an astonishing film -- hilarious, revealing and, at times, genuinely shocking.:::1:::4/5
The joke may yet be on us, but for now Affleck has delivered one of the most riveting yet virtually unwatchable documentaries you are ever likely to see.:::1:::4/5
Although there aren't enough entertaining highlights to see us through the many dull spots, the film's sheer curiosity value keeps it queasily fascinating.:::0:::2/5
Whatever the truth, Affleck's film makes for a sharp critique of celebrity culture, as vicious vloggers lead a tirade of abuse against Phoenix, only serving to increase his angst.:::1:::4/5
He'll probably never be able to top this performance, so if it's all true and Phoenix is really and truly a washed-up drunk with delusions of grandeur, this should rightly be his swan song. Way to go.:::1:::None
The focus always returns to Phoenix, until he turns his back to camera, submerges and literally disappears. Not a moment too soon.:::0:::C
There's a kind of genius to the whole affair, which is a good thing, because there's no trace of genius about the film itself, which is coarse and amateurish.:::1:::3.5/5
Although skillfully overhyped, this asinine exercise is little more than a way for Affleck and Phoenix to write off blow and hookers.:::0:::1.5/4
It raises some interesting questions about celebrity privilege and categorization.:::1:::3/5
A comedy that's toe-curlingly funny and stingingly bittersweet.:::1:::4/5
As director Casey Affleck does a brilliantly invisible job. We barely even think "fly on the wall"; we assume there are no walls.:::1:::4/5
If you like watching movie stars embarrass themselves for your amusement and for no point whatsoever, I'm Still Here is not a bad way to go.:::1:::3/5
If the film had been released as fiction, it would been greeted as a raw and revealing slice of Hollywood's underside. But Phoenix wouldn't have enjoyed himself nearly as much.:::1:::3.5/5
As directed by actor Casey Affleck -- also the subject's brother-in-law -- I'm Still Here is an unreliable, yet undeniably unique portrait of Phoenix burning his celebrity to cinders.:::1:::2.5/5
The film is shapeless in a way that suggests Affleck and his editing team is making it up entirely out of odds and ends.:::0:::2/4
Impressively directed and sharply written, this is a blackly funny mockumentary that works on several different levels, though it's not exactly an easy watch.:::1:::4/5
It's very good. Not quite as good as Exit Through The Gift Shop, but very good.:::1:::None
A lot of what makes I'm Still Here funny is that Phoenix wants to appear as an everyman, but we see a pampered, spoiled, arrogant fool who teaches us that the primary responsibility of a handler is to hold your tie while you puke in a toilet.:::1:::None
Joaquin Phoenix delivers one of his best performances playing a twisted version of himself in this might be / might not be real docu-drama.:::1:::4/5
A staggering work of near-transcendent genius - as explosive a filmmaking debut as (an alleged) celebrity meltdown:::1:::None
Real documentary or hoax it's pathetic; there are definitely only losers here, in the film, behind the camera, and in the audience.:::0:::0/5
The crux of I'm Still Here is the same as the one central to most of Lars von Trier's filmic pranks: How far can one mess with one's audience while feigning sincerity?:::0:::2/4
[It] may or may not be a put-on. If it is, it's done with a visceral edge that is as difficult to watch as it is morbidly fascinating:::1:::3/5
Assuming this is a hoax, Phoenix gives one of his greatest performances. If it's real, then he's a disgrace.:::1:::7/10
At this point, it looks like it's up to you whether you want to believe or not. Phoenix's trainwreck of a life and the "why" becomes a discussion for another time.:::1:::6/10
It is on some level a recklessly orchestrated hoax and, yes, Phoenix, who must be crazy to allow himself to be depicted in this way, has lost his marbles.:::0:::D
Hip hop hoax or artist reborn? It's hard to care after suffering through I'm Still Here:::0:::2/4
I'm Still Here is a home movie for relatives and masochists. It's the Apocalypse Now of crap.:::0:::1.5/5
If it's an act, then Phoenix is crazier than if it's for real.:::1:::B
An elaborate piece of performance art or a documentary about an identity crisis of a man committing professional suicide? Either way, I'm Still Here is grating, boring, and completely without value.:::0:::1/5
It's a neat experiment with a brilliant performance but still not all that interesting.:::0:::54/100
I'm not sure I believed a word of this film. Actors who melt down on camera are usually, well, acting. But I couldn't take my eyes off I'm Still Here.:::1:::2.5/4
To what end did Phoenix go to all this trouble, creating this bizarre false persona? What emerges in the film is an angry attack on the media, and an intermittently fascinating examination of the way celebrity flameouts are publicly & privately treated.:::1:::6.3/10
Chances are the joke is on us. The problem is the joke isn't very funny. In fact, it's kind of vile.:::0:::D
If we're truly witnessing the unraveling of a talented man in his prime, it's just sad. If it's all performance art, though, it's just pointless.:::0:::None
It's hard not to feel punk'd and trapped amid the company of jerks.:::0:::2/5
At times I'm Still Here is as ridiculous as Borat, which certainly adds weight to the naysayers' arguments, and yet even through the multiple shots of male nudity, drug taking and human desecration, everything feels organic.:::1:::4/5
Joaquin is simply adding to the ugliness, encouraging the fools, and wasting everyone's time.:::0:::D-
The movie is as damnably perplexing as the subject himself.:::0:::2/4
When I'm Still Here reached its climactic moment -- Joaquin Phoenix puking into a toilet -- I had never before felt quite so much like a toilet.:::0:::0.5/4
This riveting, dismaying documentary is that cinematic car accident you can't take your eyes from.:::1:::None
Certain bits seem obviously staged -- or at least hastily arranged. But there's a real atmosphere of fright and confusion and self-hate and impending disaster in the film.:::1:::B
We always knew that he can be a bit of a weirdo; I'm Still Here teaches us that he can be exceedingly clever as well. And there will always be a place in Hollywood for clever weirdos.:::1:::3/5
I'm Still Here is like watching the 15 minutes in Boogie Nights where Dirk Diggler tries to become a recording artist, stretched into a full-length movie.:::0:::2/4
Whatever their actual intentions, I'm Still Here does take on, at times forcefully and effectively, the pathological fallout of the Entertainment Industrial Complex.:::1:::4/5
The whole thing is such a tedious, foul-mouthed mess that it isn't even worth discussing as a riff on the Bob Dylan doc Don't Look Back or a meditation on slovenly semi-madness.:::0:::None
A glum and dispiriting counterfeit of reality that turns out to be much more interesting to speculate about than to actually watch.:::0:::2/5
It better be a hoax, because, if it is not, Phoenix needs serious mental and emotional therapy and, possibly, rehab.:::1:::4/4
No civilians were degraded in the making of this film. Its only target is its star - and if he turns out to be the movie's motivating hoax-master, fans of verite humiliation may feel cheated.:::0:::None
If I'm Still Here started as a vanity project, it became a debasing one. If it is a hoax, it shows Phoenix as an actor entirely without fear.:::1:::3/4
...does for the celebrity crash-and-burn story what This Is Spinal Tap did for rock docs. Except Spinal Tap only toured as a real band after the movie.:::1:::B+
Revelatory and self-crucifying. I not only believed it, I liked JP's music.:::1:::None
While it's interesting to speculate about what's real and what isn't in 'I'm Still Here,' the important point is that the film is utterly riveting.:::1:::A-
A psychological snuff film, unpleasant and provocative in equal measure.:::1:::2.5/4
The worst thing about I'm Still Here is the fact that it exists.:::0:::None
Whether truth or folly, it's not particularly well made. Even in the midst of Phoenix's most oddball and obsessive torment, it's boring.:::0:::1/4
A meditation on a life lived in the public eye, I'm Still Here is strange, riveting, and occasionally appalling stuff, any way you look at it.:::1:::3.5/4
What I'm Still Here most resembles is a less slick, less witty, feature-length version of HBO's Entourage, with several unusually raunchy touches...:::0:::2.5/4
There is absolutely no good that can come from this movie.:::0:::1/5
Since Phoenix spends half the film with his head down, mumbling and shirtless, I'm Still Here is literally (and figuratively) an exercise in navel-gazing.:::0:::1/4
If nothing else, the movie at least proves that there are two sides to every hoax.:::1:::None
Parts of it are close to genius; most of it is actively torturous to watch.:::0:::2.5/4
If the film is nothing more than a practical joke on the audience, it certainly doesn't aim to be as caustic or ferociously political as, say, Borat.:::1:::3/5
If this is a documentary, it's a profoundly embarrassing one, in which Affleck has exposed Phoenix's soul and found it shallow and damaged.:::1:::B
"I'm Still Here" is a film that gets in your face and under your skin. Kind of like a portrait wiped with the artist's excrement. It's disgusting, but it's still art. The question is, at what cost?:::0:::2/4
If all that I'm Still Here documents is a hoax then Joaquin Phoenix is a far better actor than I ever suspected.:::0:::4/10
The big question that the peculiar [film] doesn't answer is whether Phoenix is working through a creative rut or if any of his unusual behavior is par for the course.:::0:::2.5/5
The best mockumentaries - This Is Spinal Tap, any of Christopher Guest's films, Incident at Loch Ness - are immensely entertaining even if (or when) you realize they're fake. The same can't be said for I'm Still Here.:::0:::None
You won't personally be ridiculed and physically attacked. You'll just leave the theater feeling like you were.:::0:::2/5
Suggests a proper human being trying to make sense of a life in the public eye he never really wanted.:::1:::3/5
If the movie is a fake, the filmmakers deserve Oscars for creativity.:::1:::3/4
I do not want to know whether this is frightening fact or elaborate fiction. I like the idea that the film keeps me guessing which one it is. Or, maybe it is both?:::1:::B
As a character he is extreme, a grandiose wild man who manages to be irritating and ingratiating at the exact same time. It is a performance that is both absurd and committed and ranks among his best.:::1:::4/5
If this really is a mockumentary, Phoenix is doing some of the best acting of his career...:::1:::B+
mild, pleasant, obvious romantic comedy set on Wall Street that's most notable for its (maybe accurate) portrayal of young brokers as amoral idiots oblivious to the real-life consequences of their risky business.:::0:::83/100
Even on a reduced scale of expectation, Good Guy is stunningly empty and obvious, missing its mark as a cautionary tale or a romantic sojourn, instead slogging along a preordained trail of cliche.:::0:::D+
It's network television drama, starring actors best known for their TV work and full of the petty gripes and mild worries of characters who really have nothing compelling to worry about.:::0:::1.5/4
Writer/director Julio DePietro's first effort is every bit as obvious as it sounds, thudding from one symmetrically perfect cliche to another.:::0:::0.5/4
It has smart characters, and is wise about the ones who try to tame their intelligence by acting out.:::1:::3/4
The Good Guy has a few half-cute moments, some chuckles, and enough pretty faces to cast at least two TV pilots. What it doesn't have is a clue.:::0:::C
A sort of much more polite, estrogenized filmic companion piece to a lost, mid-era Bret Easton Ellis novel, this movie has a different, interesting cant than most films of its ilk, but can't quite turn that positive into a deal-closing recommendation.:::0:::C
For a movie that clearly aspires to be an up-to-the-minute representation of New York City, The Good Guy already feels quite dated.:::0:::2/4
The cast could not be better.:::1:::3/5
There's too little difference between the good guys and the bad guys in Julio DePietro's uninspired debut, a slickly cynical romance destined to be quickly forgotten.:::0:::2/4
Drawing on his stint at a Chicago investment firm, DePietro creates characters, dialogue and situations that feel authentic, which makes the film relevant in unexpected ways, though not as deeply as you hope he'll do in the future.:::1:::3/5
resh enough to provide the voyeuristic kick of glimpsing the frenzied lifestyle of aspiring masters of the universe.:::1:::3.5/5
A fresh and original take on a familiar tale.:::1:::4/5
New York-based love story that illustrates how old-fashioned virtues can still play a significant role in matters of the heart.:::1:::3/5
There is a reason why McCarthy doesn't get hired to play a sharking alpha male very often. When he makes an effort to work his features into a frenzy of boiling testosterone, he looks like a petulant third-grader.:::0:::0/4
Greenberg is dull and lumpish; Porter is little more than a smile on its way to a toothpaste ad.:::0:::2/4
Good guy finishes last and makes mediocre movie.:::0:::1/4
Handsome, well-done if too familiar look at the romantic and professional games played by upscale twentysomething Manhattan professionals working pre-recession.:::1:::None
Such passe testosterone worship might have been passable if the filmmaking weren't so amateurish...:::0:::2/5
The Good Guy builds its power as it goes, taking you places you don't expect. It's the rare movie that can surprise you in that way %u2013 but this one does.:::1:::None
Crass dialogue, the plot development of a Tom & Jerry cartoon, and a cast of instantly forgettable actors add up to a romantic drama that enriches your life simply by not being seen.:::0:::D+
The Good Guy suffers from the dreary want of imagination about the specificity of twentysomething life that has sunk so many other specimens of this battered genre.:::0:::None
A teensy, unoriginal young love triangle with a hint of subversion.:::0:::2/4
A light romantic comedy about a relationship between a hot-shot investment banker and a perky conservationist who learns in time that her boyfriend is a cad.:::1:::B

It's much more fun to create a franchise than to doggedly sustain it.:::0:::C
Throws down the armored gauntlet to all the other summer blockbusters - bring your "A" game or be content being the season's second best movie.:::1:::8/10
Robert Downey Jr., plays Stark with a twinkle in his eye and a sense of fun, but can't quite stamp the same authority onto the film as he did in the first version.:::1:::None
It's half the fun of the first movie and twice as convoluted.:::0:::C+
As for the actual grand finale, Downey Jr. and Cheadle seem like they're already network gaming the PS3 release instead of facing any actual threat, and Rourke goes out like a chump.:::0:::None
The whiz-bang stuff here -- while never less than slick -- doesn't produce anything we haven't seen before.:::0:::None
Despite being more traditional in structure and theme than the original, Iron Man 2 offers just about everything anyone could ask for in a superhero spectacular, and then some.:::1:::3.5/4
The most cynical and calculating part of it all is that the movie never really finds a justification for its existence; except, that is, as a bald-faced setup for The Avengers.:::0:::6/10
Many people will probably not find this one up to par with the fun of the original, but personally, I ended up having more fun with this movie, so while I gave the original a mild recommendation, I can give this one a slightly stronger one.:::1:::3/4
I was predisposed to like Iron Man even if it starred David Hasselhoff wrapped in tinfoil ... Is it worth your time? Definitely. Is it the calibre of Spider-Man 2 and The Dark Knight? Afraid not.:::1:::3/5
By rights, a superhero sequel should be darker, more intense and more dangerous, but Favreau is happy just to stay cool. That's all Iron Man's job has ever been, and frankly, that's fine by me.:::1:::3/5
The bar has been set for the 2010 summer blockbusters.:::1:::A
... The visual effects, though solid, may brighten the screen but are a poor substitute for characterisation and style - those two absent friends who we miss the most during the show.:::0:::None
In the land of sequels it's no Temple of Doom or Empire Strikes Back, but it's also not Rise of the Silver Surfer. Me and my box of Junior Mints, we still had a good time.:::1:::3.5/5
Iron Man 2 isn't an ideal sequel but it is good, fixing most of the problems of the first movie without giving up what made it work to begin with.:::1:::9/10
Some critics may claim that the Iron Man films are simply dragging on a genre that's redundant (...) but my view is that it is rescuing a big part of the Marvel universe.:::1:::3.5/5
Robert Downey Jr squeezes back into ... Tony Stark's incredible suit ... and his charismatic presence gives the movie a bigger boost than his character's jet-propelled boots.:::1:::None
Iron Man bests the biggest adversaries of the superhero genre in his second outing: production troubles, sequel-bloat and overwhelming, unrestrained fanboy hype.:::1:::4.5/5
Fans will be satisfied, even if it doesn't match the nuanced and well-rounded brilliance of the first film. But many will be disappointed with this seemingly rushed follow-up.:::0:::2/5
...the movie offers an abundance of thrills, laughs, and interpersonal communications. Yeah, action and talk; a little something for everyone.:::1:::7/10
In the quest to do things bigger, louder, and faster than its predecessor, excess can get a little... excessive. But this is still miles ahead of the average summer festival of fireballs, owing in large part to the great ensemble and snappy dialogue.:::1:::6.8/10
The repercussions of superhero life and the weight of family legacy take centre stage in this busy yet charismatic superhero melodrama.:::1:::3.5/5
The best scenes are still the ones with Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow (as Stark's charm-resistant assistant, Pepper Potts), or just Downey alone. The rest feels like padding, which is something a sleek-suited superhero shouldn't need.:::0:::2.5/4
It's enjoyable to see a quality superhero dynamically and enthusiastically rendered.:::1:::B+
Still worth watching. Just set your bar a little lower.:::1:::None
There's an outdated feel to it all, from its cold-war view of America to the AC/DC soundtrack.:::0:::2/5
Snappy and fast-paced.:::1:::None
Crasser, noisier, more metallic:::0:::None
Suffers from a bit of sequel-itis..but don't look for what it isn't; enjoy the solid filmmaking and actors who take their comic book-created roles very seriously.:::1:::B+
All of the charm and romance of the original has been ironed out by excess.:::0:::33/100
Tony Stark is Dick Cheney's foreign policy driven by Grover Norquist's fiscal policy, sold to the public by Ari Gold. Very confusing.:::0:::5/10
You won't find a more overqualified cast this year. Then out come the CGI effects and everything becomes a yawn.:::0:::None
Iron Man 2 suffers from typical sequelitis. It bites off more than it can chew and feels drowsy as a result.:::1:::73/100
A mild improvement over its lackluster predecessor...:::1:::2.5/4
Sometimes simple is better. The original thrived on few integral characters and a world-wise approach to storytelling. This feature seems to think action is more important than story and an overabundance of characters is a necessity.:::0:::2.5/4
Don Cheadle, Samuel L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell and again Gwyneth Paltrow are gladly on hand, but only Robert Downey Jr. can so comfortably guide us through the conspicuous outlay.:::1:::3/5
Take all twelve plots, set your iPod on shuffle, and watch as the franchise deteriorates into a shallow pool of half-baked ideas and detached snark.:::0:::2/5
Downey's Stark was a human hero. But the dude in "Iron Man 2" has gone superhero and the synthetic construction doesn't offer the same fullness of character it once did. Still...:::1:::4/5
Downey Jr. makes it all worthwhile.:::1:::3/5
Recognizes and repeats a lot of the things that made the original great, but also falls victim to many of the pitfalls of past superhero sequels.:::1:::3.5/5
The over-hyped Jon Favreau movie, "Iron Man 2," is a downer and a disappointment, especially when compared to the entertaining first movie that came before it.:::0:::C-
I cannot imagine that anyone intimately involved with the making of Iron Man 2 would ever, on their own dime and their own time, ever go to see a movie like Iron Man 2.:::0:::80/100
Not a bad followup to the original Iron Man. Good performances and plenty of first-rate action. Iron Man 2 is great fun. Paul Chambers, CNN.:::1:::B
Rourke puts a human face, albeit a bashed one, on comic book villainy.:::1:::B-
successfully fits the summer blockbuster mold, but holds out just enough surprises to make it a worthwhile diversion:::1:::3/4
Fails to resolve the fascist implications of Stark's claim to have 'privatized world peace'; here, Stark's human and machine sides correlate to Klaatu and Gort in 'The Day the Earth Stood Still,' who demanded the world accept a robot police force...:::1:::3/4
Fans of the comic book might well be satisfied. Anyone else will find moments here - it certainly looks cool - but might, like me, leave the cinema feeling a little undernourished.:::1:::3/5
Aesthetically, 'Iron Man 2' is a polished flick. Plot wise, it's almost as bad as 'Catwoman.':::0:::D+
Rusty first act can't slow Iron Man 2.:::1:::3.5/4.0
An improvement in almost every way (over the first film), most notably in a better, more serious screenplay.:::1:::B
Favreau throws in everything but the kitchen sink in his desperate effort to meet stratospheric expectations, and the result is too much of a so-so thing.:::1:::None
Iron Man 2 is exactly what critics and audiences deserve following the celebration of that awful, dung-hued first film.:::0:::None
Iron Man 2 careens between self-awareness and self-promotion, which is not to say these are opposite conditions.:::0:::None
That rarest of the rara avis, a sequel that's better than the original.:::1:::4.5/5
There's enough Downey and copious amounts of attendant razzle dazzle in this overstuffed sequel to make for a cautious recommendation.:::1:::None
Bent on escapism and content to stay on the surface of the issues it presents, it at least does its best to give that surface a pleasing, gleaming polish.:::1:::6/10
Typical popcorn film, except for the huge budget.:::1:::C+
Such a visual grabber, with so much unexpected food for thought, that it's hard to see how it could be topped.:::1:::None
What's missing is any real sense of danger...Is Iron Man 2 as solid as its predecessor? No, but it's still nice to spend some time with some old friends.:::1:::3/4
a cracking good tale of good, evil, large egos, small mercies, and the fate of the world. Of course.:::1:::4/5
Iron Man becomes the Tin Man because this sequel has lost its heart. Luckily the special effects and Downey's charm save the day.:::1:::6/10
In a refreshing and unexpected turn, the sequel to Iron Man doesn't find a changed man. Inside the metal, imperfect humanity grows even more so, as thought-provoking questions of identity meet techno-fantasy made flesh.:::1:::None
Iron Man 2 could be Chaplin Meets The Wrestler Meets Shakespeare in Love Meets Stan Lee. Instead it's more The Stooges Meet Sara Lee.:::0:::2.0/5
Probably the most refreshing trait in Jon Favreau's Iron Man movies is that the most entertaining moments come when there's no action to speak of.:::1:::4/5
Film predstavlja predobru kombinaciju akcije, drame i humora da bi ga se otpisalo kao rutinersko holivudsko eksploatiranje devete umjetnosti:::1:::6/10
Pales beside the original.:::0:::C+
... there's no doubt that Robert Downey Jr. continues to own and entertain in the part he's spent a lifetime preparing for.:::1:::3.5/4.0
Because we already know how Iron Man came to be, 'Iron Man 2' isn't quite as interesting as the first film. But it does pack a super-hero wallop of action and fun.:::1:::3/4
Entertaining enough but falls short of delivering much of anything new.:::0:::2.5/5
Lots of sizzle, no real stakes. The movie is at its best when it's just Tony Stark hanging out.:::1:::7/10
It'd be difficult for any additional Iron Man incarnation to surpass the original, but Iron Man 2 is a worthy follow-up.:::1:::3/4
Whether playing Charlie Chaplin or a billionaire with superhero armor; Downy will pull us in every time.:::1:::4/5
Relying heavily on CGI and action set-pieces, the sequel lacks an engaging plot and good actors (Jackson, Cheadle, Paltrow) are underused, but it offers fast-paced, glossy, polished entertainment like a quick joy ride in Disneyland.:::1:::B-
While the plot is not as tight as it could be, Iron Man 2 still delivers in every other way.:::1:::3.5/4
Contains enough great action sequences, impressive special effects and splendid performances to hold your interest most of the time. Excellent way to start summer movie season.:::1:::None
There are interesting ideas and cool moments, but momentum is rarely allowed to build and characters regularly seem to be forgotten about.:::1:::2.5/4
It has more characters, more stuff blown to bits, more of everything. It's a condition common to sequels, and it can be both a good and bad thing, but this is still great fun.:::1:::3/4
We've had to wait this long for Rourke and Downey to share the screen, and when they finally do, they're turned into action figures.:::1:::3/5
Its a collection of scenes where stuff happens but not a real movie. The first Iron Man proved it could be smart AND entertaining. This is just mildly ok in parts.:::0:::C
Where Iron Man was champagne, Iron Man 2 is Asti.:::1:::6/10
You're not getting the Marvel equivalent of Dark Knight. You're getting Robert Downey Jr. having a blast and wanting you to have a blast too.:::1:::4/5
Once you get past accepting comedian Garry Shandling as U.S. Senator Stern (hey, he's a comic in a comic book movie), 'Iron Man 2' kicks in, turbos upward and fuses on into one spectacular action tale.:::1:::A-
Iron Man 2's dubious politlca stance...muddles what could have made a good sequel even better.:::1:::None
Iron Man 2 doesn't quite degenerate into a Transformers 3 ... [it's] recommended, but with major reservations.:::1:::2.5/4
Those who wait through all of the credits will get a glimpse of what is in store for the next superhero saga. I hope between now and then they remember that less is more.:::1:::B
I enjoyed Iron Man 2 for the popcorn spectacle is was, and I had at least as much fun as it appeared Robert Downey Jr. and Jon Favreau had making it.:::1:::4/5
It's hard to imagine what the Iron Man franchise would be like without the great Downey Jr. That's something I never want to think about, and luckily, we don't have to.:::1:::3.5/5
If you're just going to see men in robot suits blow each other up while classic rock blares on the soundtrack, Iron Man 2 will do just fine...:::1:::3/5
"Iron Man 2" rocks!, with no signs of rust in the series' armor.:::1:::7/10
If Iron Man 2 had any more subplots they'd call it Iron Man 2-5:::1:::3/4
Shellhead's back! And nearly finishes himself off in blockbuster sequel:::1:::B
Despite some imperfections, this film accelerates well into a spectacular final act, once again proving Iron Man invincible.:::1:::B
... an acceptable action flick that creates a stiff wind but never achieves "blow-you-away" status.:::1:::2.5/4
Again, its leading man remains the most compelling component of this franchise.:::1:::3/5
...there's plenty of eye-popping action, snappy one-liners, and Robert Downey Jr. working at the top of his game...:::1:::B
Even the director...seems to view the heavy clanking of mechanized men as a bit of a chore: the kind of well-prepared yet unremarkable meat course that must inevitably follow the delightful amuse bouche of Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Stark.:::1:::None
Superhero Stark remains intriguing.:::1:::3/4
Iron Man 2 does what it can within the confines of what it has to do. The Hollywood machine has trained us to have certain expectations for blockbuster sequels and this film neither deviates nor blazes new territory.:::1:::3.5/5
Downey whips out the big guns, sexy banter in fun sequel.:::1:::4/5
A problematic yet still quite entertaining sequel:::1:::None
The best part of Iron Man 2 is Gwyneth Paltrow, and not just because of her energy and wit, or even her chemistry with the leading man. She's also the film's beating heart.:::1:::3/4
Entertaining ... but long stretches of the movie are more fizzle than sizzle.:::0:::2.5/4
Iron Man 2 is as good as the 2008 original and may be even better.:::1:::3.5/4
a Republican fantasy of big guns, cool gadgets, fast cars, non-threatening women to objectify and the corpses of Cold War bogeys propped up like ideological scarecrows.:::0:::1/4
It concentrates on being lighter, more fleet-footed and more consistent than its predecessor.:::1:::3.5/4
The inevitable Iron Man 3 needs a better screenplay than this.:::0:::2.5/4
Iron Man 2 rocks. It does so literally and loudly, thanks to lots of licks interspersed through the soundtrack from metal mavens AC/DC. No slow spots. No sequel let down.:::1:::4.5/5
This may not be quite as good as the original, it doesn't actually need to be over two hours long, you could avoid the sag in the middle with judicious editing of the screenplay by Justin Theroux. But there's still a lot of joy to be had here.:::1:::3.5/5
It's not that story conflicts aren't desired but here, with so many problems -- some more implausible than others -- this Iron Man becomes a victim of its own heavy metal. Yet Downey still soars.:::1:::6/10
We soon realize that fight scenes involving faceless actors in big titanium battle suits sound like nothing so much as a multi-kettle kitchen accident.:::0:::4/10
Both the movie franchise and Tony Stark the alter ego are more self indulgent than putting your picture on a restaurant wall after downing a 5-lb. bacon cheese burger, then getting that burger named after you. And naming it Awesome.:::1:::3/4
This one may provide some temporary thrills but they are empty ones that will largely be forgotten within a couple of days.:::0:::2/5
This is the very definition of slam-bang entertainment, beating one over the head with as much potential amusement as possible until they surrender with a stunned if satisfied popcorn smile.:::1:::3.5/5
It's a solid blockbuster with a few faults that you just don't mind overlooking.:::1:::2.5/4
Even in the face of this dazzling ensemble and deeper budgetary pockets, Favreau keeps his wits about him, embarking on a snappy second round agreeably mindful of what clicked before.:::1:::B+
This sequel was an improvement in many ways. I preferred Don Cheadle as Tony's friend Rhodey, the two seemed to have a better rapport, and Mickey Rourke just can't be beat as a villain:::1:::3/4
Like so many sequels based on a rich and abundant source material with rabid fanboys to please, Iron Man 2 bites off a bit more than it can convincingly chew.:::1:::6.5/10
The movie is fun, but not as much fun as it could be because it feels like it's so busy enjoying its own cleverness it doesn't even need an audience.:::1:::2.5/4
It's a rush, but it's more like taxiing than take-off.:::1:::A-
As superhero movies go this one is definitely a winner.:::1:::None
Outrageously entertaining.:::1:::None
In one fell swoop, director Jon Favreau has driven this once-promising series straight into the ground.:::0:::1.5/4
It's still impressive enough for a flick to be called "a worthwhile sequel to a superior film," and Iron Man 2 is certainly that.:::1:::4/5
At its best when its personality is showing, the brilliant Iron Man's sequel hasn't as much on display. Still, top-flight special effects action and sparky comic riffing from Downey, Jr. and Rockwell make up for many inadequacies.:::1:::3.5/5
[T]he movie's fluff-headed ignorance of its own self is so merry that it's almost impossible to get upset about it. Downey's Stark may no longer be surprising, but he's still a helluva lotta fun to hang out with for two hours...:::1:::None
Downey seems to have found a comfort zone, and his enjoyment combined with a charismatic personality transcends the screen. Eye candy is dished out with the attractive sexiness of Paltrow and Johansson, who joust for affectionate testosterone-fueled respo:::1:::2.5/4
Showmanship is the order of the day for superhero sequel Iron Man 2, though the flash and dazzle distract from plot machinery that's more than a little clunky.:::1:::2.5/4
When it's working solely for itself, Iron Man 2 works, and does so better than its predecessor.:::1:::3/4
The first Iron Man was a wonderful surprise... [I]n many ways this movie seems like the morning after.:::1:::3/5
Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man? OK, pretty good. Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark? Brilliant.:::1:::4/5
Offers fewer surprises and exhilarating scenes than its smarter predecessor, briefly loses its footing, and suffers from excessive contrivance, but remains mindlessly entertaining thanks to its solid cast and some thrilling action sequences.:::1:::7.0/10
What happens in between [the few action sequences] is droll and lively, thanks mostly to Downey and Rockwell's typically colorful performances; it just isn't very super, you know?:::1:::B-
The filmmakers haven't quite bled Iron Man of his appeal, they haven't dented him or let him rust, but they've done precious little to polish him, either. The shine is still there, but just barely.:::1:::B-
Yes, sometimes there's a bit too much story at the expense of the action. But when was the last time you had that complaint about a big event movie?:::1:::A-
Casting the likes of Downey and Rourke and then imprisoning them in jointed refrigerators is resource-squandering of the highest order.:::0:::None
The movie settles into a series of ho-hum conflicts and complications, and the requisite slam-bang ending is perfunctory at best.:::0:::None
Frantic, place-holding sequel? Check. Third installment guaranteed? Check.:::1:::None
It's the first summer movie of 2010. Let the expensive silliness begin.:::1:::None
The battles possess their own daffy clarity and logic.:::1:::3/4
Robert Downey Jr.'s irreverent, Peter Pan-like portrayal of billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (aka Iron Man) continues to be the movie's strongest asset.:::1:::3/4
Faster and louder than the first film, "Iron Man 2" is a fanboy's dream come true.:::1:::4/4
I'd have told even non-comic book fans to see the original Iron Man. I'd recommend this sequel mostly to the initiated... which probably accounts for 80 percent of all moviegoers.:::1:::2.5/4
[Downey] gives Iron Man 2 its fascination. The rest is a cluttered, clattering toy story.:::0:::None
This sequel, alas, settles for old elements in a new alloy -- less iron, lots more lead and tin.:::0:::None
Hammer and Vanko's uneasy dance rivals Tony and Pepper's banter for Iron Man 2's funniest couple &#8230; The screwball vibe is even more pronounced &#8230; with wittier dialogue and even more deadpan delivery.:::1:::B+
Superman has Kryptonite. Green Lantern is powerless against the color yellow. And if Iron Man 2 is any indication, Tony Stark's big weakness could be scripts.:::1:::6.5/10
A summer blockbuster that's interesting without ever being riveting; entertaining without ever being thrilling. Summer 2010 has started with a piece of popcorn entertainment that just happens to taste like it was popped in 2008.:::1:::None
The surprisingly funny script from actor Justin Theroux gives Stark a new reason to reassess himself while also providing some terrific banter for Stark and Pepper's simmering sublimation.:::1:::B+
The general excellence of the casting trumps the inarguable excellence of the technology.:::1:::2.5/4
This cluttered, awkward blockbuster is held together by safety pins and movie-star charisma.:::1:::3/4
A film that is fast, loud and enough rowdy fun to be worth the price of admission.:::1:::2.5/4
Favreau's a workmanlike filmmaker who gets virtuoso performances from his leads, particularly Paltrow and Cheadle, but most of all Downey.:::1:::3/4
The franchise's bounce and lightness make it unique among recent comic book adaptations, which have leaned increasingly toward heavy, dreary themes they don't have the dramatic weight to support.:::1:::B
It's a funny, exciting and even deceptively smart action-thriller with a few things to say about use of technology for destructive purposes.:::1:::3.5/4
Like the original, Iron Man 2 is a good time from start to finish.:::1:::3/4
The action sequences are fun, though not as exhilarating as in the 2008 original, and the dialogue can be zingy.:::1:::2.5/4
Downey still has plenty of moments of charm (nobody kicks a car aside as casually as this guy), and most of the action sequences are lively and fun.:::1:::2.5/4
More like IRON MAN 1.5:::0:::6/10
You're left wanting more, but not quite the "more" Iron Man 2 works so hard to supply.:::0:::2.5/5
Not as clever or thrilling as No. 1 (or as well-written/ad-libbed), but there's still good tongue-in-cheek fun thanks to Downey and his cohorts.:::1:::B
It's easy to talk about what Iron Man 2 doesn't do, but what it does do is so full of energy and genuine enthusiasm that it's hard to imagine anyone walking out unhappy.:::1:::3.5/5
While the title is "Iron Man 2," what we're being given is "Iron Man Squared." There's too much going on, and all the characters and plots and revelations and foreshadowings do not fill the film but bloat it.:::0:::2.5/5
It's a good - but not great - action-packed popcorn picture.:::1:::8/10
It's a clean, efficient, somewhat generic piece of storytelling and most of the additions are not subtractions. This passes for success in the summer movie season.:::1:::B
The franchise still has a lot of spark, but next time they need to clean the corrosion off the batteries.:::1:::2.5/4
"I think I did OK," says Tony at the end. But I think he could have done better.:::1:::2.5/4
It's not a feast, it's a quick fix. You want bombs? You want quips? You want tech? You got 'em. Now go away . . . and come back next July.:::0:::None
My favorite part of Downey's performance is watching him think, which is more fascinating to watch than every Miley Cyrus, Jennifer Lopez and Ashton Kutcher movie combined!:::1:::4/4
There are too many new characters, too many crossing story lines, not enough romance and our hero's a smug jerk for the first half hour. Who cares? Iron Man 2 still rocks.:::1:::B
I don't want to see his vulnerable side. I want to see him kicking 'bots and taking names. And there's precious little of that here.:::0:::2/4
Not better but pretty good nonetheless.:::1:::4/5
Iron Man 2 emerges as a movie that's at war, not between Iron Man and his surfeit of enemies, but between two different movie-making instincts.:::0:::2/4
This mega-mecha melee manages to give short shrift to both the airborne action set-pieces that define Iron Man's zoomy panache and incoming supervillain Whiplash.:::0:::2.5/5
it's the tenuous chinks in Stark's personal armor ... as well as Downey's captivatingly honest examinations of his character's inherent flaws, that permit the actor, and not the effects, to carry the drama:::1:::4/5
Often playing like it has been jury-rigged from bits and pieces of a longer, smarter movie, Iron Man 2 seems chiefly intended as a placeholder for its next dozen or so sequels.:::0:::2/4
The big problem with Iron Man 2, maybe, is that it so dutifully gives the people what they want, instead of giving them what they didn't know they wanted.:::0:::6.5/10
Flabby, disjointed, and eschewing conflict for extended scenes of improv clowning, it's the Superheroic equivalent of a Rat Pack film.:::0:::None
The substance of the original Iron Man, the brain and the soul that set it apart from the typical seasonal fare and made it one of the best films of 2008, also have been blown to bits.:::0:::None
Appealing mainly to male special effects fans, this high octane, low intellect thing has only two performances worth watching, by Larry Shandling and Sam Rockwell.:::0:::6/10

Director Jon Favreau's light touch and Robert Downey Jr.'s gift with a wisecrack continue to make this superhero franchise good, noisy fun.:::1:::3/4

Iron Man 2 works quite well, in fits and starts to be sure, but its a fine piece of entertainment.:::1:::7/10
Iron Man 2 is on par with the first film. The flick delivers more action and comedy at the expense of an uneven and overly complicated plot line.:::1:::4.5/5
The movie could have easily been undone by its own overambition, but Iron Man 2 prevails as the light and fun summer blockbuster we were all expecting.:::1:::3.5/5
Parental Content Review (all the details you need to know):::1:::None
Talky, curiously depressing for most of its running-time, weighed down by too many heroes and an army of uninteresting villains, and messily prosaic in the big action moments, 'Iron Man 2' suggests that this franchise is already running on fumes.:::0:::C
Why get an actor like Rourke at the peak of his recent comeback and then lock him up to repair drones and type on a keyboard for the second half of the film? Hardly innovation for a film that argues against wasteful spending on hardware.:::0:::2.5/4
At times it is hard to decipher what's what and who's who, and the storyline does venture into boring town, but the explosive action and comic relief make it watchable.:::1:::None
Offers a burst of entertainment so fast and lively you might choose to wear a neck-brace while you watch it.:::1:::4/5
[Downey's] innate charisma, his ability to deliver cutting lines of dialogue with the perfect inflection, and his capacity to overcome narrative shortcomings are reasons why Iron Man 2 works better than one might suspect.:::1:::3/4
Iron Man 2 is more of a set-up for the upcoming Avengers picture than a stand-alone adventure -- a puzzling and unexpected disappointment, considering how fresh and entertaining the first picture was.:::0:::2/4
There's too much superfluity for Iron Man 2 to be a great comic-book movie, but when it's good, it's exactly the kind of summer entertainment people are looking for.:::1:::3/5
Iron Man 2 simply simply isn't as satisfying as its predecessor.:::0:::2.5/4
There's so much clunky exposition in the script attributed to Justin Theroux that it seems forever before the first action sequence, which has surprisingly mediocre special effects.:::0:::2/4
This sequel to the 2008 mega-blockbuster fires on more cylinders than the first film, yet relies on star Robert Downey Jr. more than it does kinetic energy and rock 'em-sock 'em technology (which it has in spades).:::1:::4/5
A major disappointment. I hated arrogant, bratty, foot-stomping man-baby Tony Stark and prissy Pepper Potts. Too much brattle and no story.:::0:::None
Iron Man 2 is as good as its predecessor - and in some ways even better.:::1:::B+
Downey's head and heart are in the right place, but the movie is more in pieces than whole, and more about iron than about men.:::0:::C+

Scattered and uneven, this action drama wastes a terrific Tom Cruise.:::0:::2.0/5
Fast-paced action sequences, coupled with the performances and O'Neill's script, make "Knight and Day" a fun film that will please fans of the action genre.:::1:::3/4
It's a calculated, artificial formula for box office success barely disguised as a story.:::0:::None
I'm just not feeling enough to really get worked up about what's wrong with it.:::0:::2.5/5
It's not a bad movie. It's not exactly a good movie, either, but it's got its moments. Knight and Day is a film about charisma and on-screen chemistry, but unfortunately not much else.:::1:::6.5/10
An incidental romance punctuated with out-of-one's-element humor and computer-assisted chase sequences, wholly weightless.:::0:::5/10
Attempts to walk a delicate tightrope, simultaneously parodying and indulging in outrageous super-spy action, and fails in both endeavors.:::0:::C
Cruise and Diaz both seem refreshed here -- both are at their charming best.:::1:::4/5
As a pure popcorn, dreams-writ-large, kiss-kiss-bang-bang, globetrotting romp, Knight and Day delivers. [Blu-ray]:::1:::3/4
A highly enjoyable, breezy action film. Cruise and Diaz are fun to watch.:::1:::7/10
The action sequences go on too long and the reliance on CGI is often blatant, but Cruise's irrepressible zest and Diaz's ditsy charm pull the film through the rough patches.:::1:::None

"Knight & Day" is absurd without being funny. It's also lacking in the onscreen chemistry department." Paul Chambers, CNN.:::0:::D+
Knight and Day feels like the product of a different era. And no, I'm not just talking about the 1990s, when star Tom Cruise was a legitimate box office draw and not an ever-smiling kook with an uncanny knack for making people feel uncomfortable.:::1:::3/5

A film to cheer audiences, 12 and slightly upwards, not seduce critics...:::1:::3/5
Diminishing returns eventually topple it, but not before Cruise has cemented one of his most relaxed and likeable performances in some time.:::1:::3/5
We don't buy tickets to movies like this to see sensible storylines and deep characters; we want overwrought, effects-heavy action and sexless banter.:::1:::3/5
Knight and Day is by no means the worst film of the summer, but with a flailing Cruise on board, it feels like the most desperate.:::0:::2/5
The stunt work is impressive, the various international locales are easy on the eye and Cruise and Diaz make a fun couple but it all feels calculated and mechanical.:::1:::3/5

If Diaz and Cruise had shared some chemistry on screen I may have forgiven all of its sins. Alas, they don't.:::0:::None
Though it sells itself as a free-wheeling adventure, Knight and Day is a precisely-constructed and strategically vital opening salvo in the restoration of the 'Tom Cruise' brand.:::1:::3/5
Cruise gets to do what he does best, namely flash a winning grin then leap from a moving vehicle, guns blazing. Diaz gets to play to her strength, which is goofball romantic comedy.:::1:::None
Cruise and Cruz are a well-paired team, here to have fun, and that fun translates in a movie that features moments that are intentionally and deliriously absurd.:::1:::B+

The wonderful screwball chemistry between a cunning, tough-to-read Cruise and a naive, open-book Diaz carries Knight and Day effortlessly over a few bumpy spots along the way.:::1:::3.5/5
James Mangold counts Stanley Donen's Charade and Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest among his inspirations for Knight and Day and I'm still wondering why.:::0:::2.5/5
It's a film absolutely of the moment; you're not going to come out of it debating its finer points.:::1:::3/5
Knight And Day runs out of ammunition (unlike its characters) well before the closing credits start to roll.:::0:::C+

By the time the story nears its climax, we completely jettison dreary reality and take flight with this plucky duo on their way to 'someday':::1:::None
Player or pawn? That is the key question in this delicious action thriller that finds the perfect balance between comedy and taking itself seriously enough to be real:::1:::None
Knight and Day works due to the charms of Diaz and Cruise, and it figures out how to exaggerate action without making the audience feel insulted.:::1:::3/4

delivers plenty of bang, but with a much-appreciated wink:::1:::3/4
Half-aware it's an action flick while trying to breezily amuse, and half-alert to its comic potential while roaring off on a chase or shoot-out, it staggers along. Knight and Day's potential vanishes in the haze of a mundane situation-comedy.:::0:::None
Entertaining enough but utterly ridiculous.:::0:::2.5/5
The exciting "Knight And Day" is a blast that stays in Cruise control.:::1:::8/10
All style and no substance...:::0:::2/4
Cruise is top-billed, but the point of view belongs to Diaz: This is not a male-oriented actioner but a romantic fantasy for plugged-in, green screen-savvy girls sympathetic to the idea of courtship as a series of deliriums and fugue states...:::1:::2.5/4
Its about as light and fluffy as summer action movies get. It's also as relentless and desperate to entertain as we always hope the worst summer movies won't be.:::0:::2/4
This is a summer action film and it does deliver on the promise of action. While the action is so extreme as to border on silliness, this is often done intentionally for comic effect.:::1:::C+
Banks on the star power of its leading man without realizing the account is overdrawn.:::0:::2.5/5
Cameron Diaz has turned to PIXAR to create the perfect CGI manifestation of a face. 'It has been a long time since the sight of me has evoked both Buzz and Woody,' explained Cameron.:::0:::C
Filled with plenty of feather-light entertainment, Knight and Day is an enjoyable matinee that will dissolve away from you as step out into the summer sun, refreshed and smiling.:::1:::7/10
Mangold keeps spirits high and the touch light.:::1:::3/5
Jumpy, unmotivated, and senseless.:::0:::None
Cruise is refreshing and Diaz is not. But that is not enough to ruin the entire film!:::1:::3/5
Crazy Cruise has a great time in this summer flick, and you will too.:::1:::7/10
[It] disappoints because it should have been much better. Instead of a comic thriller with some depth, it is as lightweight as a soap bubble, and just as likely to pop.:::0:::2/5
...the effects throw us into physics-defying action so preposterous that one half of the movie undermines the other.:::0:::C
Propulsive action fare for romantic comedy escapists.:::1:::4/5
If you like exhilarating, escapist nonsense with personality, Knight and Day is for you.:::1:::3.0/5
Mindless escapist blockbuster comic action film, that was fun for awhile but ran out of charm before it could close the deal.:::0:::C+
When you combine the right actors with correct chemistry and some decent writing, even formula works.:::1:::4/5
Knight and Day is often so mindlessly preposterous (especially during the CGI-heavy action scenes) that it makes The A-Team look as complex as L.A. Confidential by comparison. Luckily, Cruise and Diaz both have their movie-star wattage burning bright.:::0:::2.5/4
The quiet[character] moments are placed perfectly, like emotional depth charges that explode and energize the enjoyment factor.:::1:::3/4
True, "Knight and Day" is preposterous nonsense. Just think of it as a spoof of one of Cruise's "Mission: Impossible" movies on crack.:::1:::3/4
The pairing of attractive movie stars usually translates into box office gold. This globetrotting action adventure is proof that too many cooks spoil the broth. The glaring red flag is that...:::0:::2/4
Another generic big-name action film minus any real heart or soul.:::1:::C
Fast-paced and charming, Knight and Day may well restore the box office fortunes of its well-matched leading man and lady. It's the Mr. & Mrs. Smith of 2010.:::1:::4/4
It's a pleasant bit of nonsense, made all the more palatable by Tom Cruise's terrific work.:::1:::3/4
I think we all secretly want to be kidnapped by Tom Cruise, build chemistry together during a globetrotting spy game while trading sassy banter, and then sneak a whiff of shorty's sneaker lifts when he's not looking.:::0:::2/4
Tom Cruise is not the failsafe, bankable actor he once was. But his performance here reminds us of what made him a star in the first place.:::1:::2.5/4
An action star who doesn't glower -- what a relief!:::1:::B
By the finale, it's hard to shake the sense that the movie has already expired, and everyone involved [is] just trying to prop it up, "Weekend at Bernie's"-style, long enough to heave it over the 100-minute mark.:::0:::None
The people who made Knight and Day may think they're giving audiences what they want but what they're really saying is: This is what audiences deserve.:::0:::C
The slick, proficient Knight and Day is proof that you should never count Cruise out.:::1:::None
Though the movie suffers from over-edited action, the quirky leads keep things headed north by northwest.:::1:::2.5/4
You might have to be hankering for a dumb action flick to really get your money's worth in the theater, but if you are that is exactly what you will get.:::1:::None
It's an unmarried True Lies:::1:::None
You'll have to offset the fun performance of Tom Cruise with the annoying and shallow performance of Cameron Diaz. For me the latter overruled the former.:::0:::2.5/5
If you've ever heard a humorless man try to tell a joke, then you know everything you need to about James Mangold's straining, flat-in-all-directions foray into action-comedy, Knight and Day.:::0:::2/5
An uneven action-comedy that too often trips over its own potential.:::0:::2.5/5
Of the dozen or so studio summer extravaganzas that have landed on screens thus far this year, excluding animated features, James Mangold's Knight and Day strikes me as the most entertaining and, inarguably, the nimblest of the lot:::1:::3/5
Knight and Day woke me up to just how awful some summer entertainments have become. It isn't that the film is harmful, except to moviegoers' wallets and movie lovers' morale, but that it is truly phenomenal for the purity of its incoherence.:::0:::None
A slick and action-packed, but so brainless, thrill-less, unfunny and tedious that you'll yearn for any of the 80's and 90's classic action comedies.:::0:::4.5/10
Cruise and Diaz nearly save Knight and Day.:::0:::2.5/4.0
Knight and Day is generic and insultingly stupid. Don't waste your time or money on this one.:::0:::1/5
Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz on a wild and suspenseful ride.:::1:::3/5
Cruise and Diaz have worked together before, but this is their first summer-movie pairing, and their star qualities are so similar that together, instead of romantic chemistry they generate a sort of giddy, blinding falseness.:::0:::None
Cruise has always come across as the kind of guy you'd like to hang out with and it's that charm that carries the film during the more, shall we say, unrealistic scenes.:::1:::2.5/4
Overly cute and overconvinced of its own cool.:::0:::2/5
Truly enjoyed Tom Cruise in this movie. Diaz...not so much.:::1:::2.75/5
The opening mid-air shootout is edgy, funny and clouded in question-raising mystique. It's everything the film that follows is not.:::0:::2.5/5
Cruise and Diaz put the entire force of their charms behind Knight and Day's strained action-comedy; unfortunately, it's never quite enough.:::0:::2.5/5
The plot takes more shortcuts than a foolish out-of-town driver trying to second-guess his or her Garmin.:::0:::3/5
This is a lot of fun, but leave your brain at home.:::1:::7/10
Lighthearted and silly, to the point that you don't mind Cruise's immobilized forehead or that Mangold obviously has henchman entering a scene wearing dark helmets just so he can recycle the stuntmen as they get knocked off.:::1:::None
Beyond implausible, but loads of fun thanks to the chemistry of the leads.:::1:::3/5
What a summer popcorn movie should be. It's big, it's preposterous, and it's a whole lot of fun:::1:::4/5
It's more comedy than action -- which is fine, because the comedy is zesty and not overly quirky, and mostly pretty funny.:::1:::B
Knight and Day is a fun and over-the-top action flick that delivers a great performance from Tom Cruise but needed work in the blue screen effects department.:::1:::3/5
Cruise and Diaz share one indifferent smooch. They come off less like potential lovers than amiable traveling companions.:::0:::2.5/4
What drags Knight and Day back to Earth is the reluctance to fully commit to the zaniness.:::0:::C+
Once the initial suspense over Roy's intentions wears off, Knight and Day shifts from mildly intriguing to clumsy and predictable.:::0:::2.5/5
It's a shame that an initially fast-paced romp like this limps across the finish line.:::0:::C+
Cruise, for his part, can still dependably produce unlimited quantities of Tom Cruise-ness, a natural resource undiminished and virtually unchanged since its discovery in 1983. The question for the 2010 audience is whether we have any use for it anymore.:::0:::None
Who needs things like narrative cohesion and logic when you've got Cruise and Diaz at their winsome best in Knight and Day?:::1:::2.5/4
Slick and energetic action-comedy showcase for Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz has nothing on its mind but pure escapism.:::0:::None
If nothing else, Knight and Day is an enjoyable and entertaining action flick with one of the best summer movie openings in a long time.:::1:::2.5/4
Cruise retains an unusual charisma and a natural feeling for the camera.:::1:::None
Knight and Day, his latest tilt in that direction, has its flaws, but at least it gives audiences a good time.:::1:::2.5/4
A little more time developing why these strangers come to care for each other might have helped, and ultimately, it's a failure of script more than performances.:::0:::2/4
The real purpose of the exercise is watching the two stars radiate charisma at nuclear levels while zipping through exotic locales in high-speed vehicles.:::1:::B+
The lackluster Killers tried to do the same thing, to much less success. But this smarter, comic action-thriller has almost everything you could ask from a supposed "popcorn" movie -- especially in terms of action.:::1:::3/4
After so many bad romance movies, it's a treat to see genuine sparks fly between two major stars. That the budding relationship evolves over the course of bullets, die-hard assassins and chiseled torsos increases the pleasure.:::1:::None
If you can settle into its odd, low-key groove, I think you'll find it's a light pop beverage that goes down easy during one of the lamest blockbuster summers in recent memory. My parents are really going to like it.:::1:::B
Give in to the ridiculousness, and Knight and Day is frisky fun.:::1:::2.5/4
A motorcycle chase through the streets of Spain during the running of the bulls is a great idea. A motorcycle chase through the streets of Spain during the running of computer-generated bulls is not.:::0:::1/4
Tom Cruise should go bonkers more often. At least on screen, that is.:::1:::B
Blackouts are a crucial element of Knight and Day, explaining how much of the hoo-hah continues to happen.:::0:::C+
One of those films that constantly feels like it could have and should have been better as it threatens to come together but doesn't quite do so.:::0:::None
The film as a whole lacks a pulse-pounding, swoony mood of adventure and romance. Still, it does have Cruise, and he's almost worth a recommendation alone for his spirited efforts.:::0:::C
The trouble is the perpetual-battery plot and multiple use of a knockout-potion bit are weak beyond belief, to put it mildly, and the romantic hero and heroine have low-power screen chemistry, the sine qua non of this sort of thing.:::0:::C+
Knight and Day shows Cruise firing on all cylinders, and moviegoers will be reminded of why they rushed out to see his movies in the first place.:::1:::3/5
Though it boasts the shiny white teeth star power of Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz and offers a cute premise, Knight and Day is a flimsy enterprise.:::0:::C+
A bona fide example of comedy/action, it delivers a perfect one-two punch of both. Energetically directed by James Mangold, this is the film that the poorly received Killers hoped to be.:::1:::7/10
To misquote Cole Porter, 'Knight and Day' isn't the one...a cross between 'Charade' and 'Mission Impossible' that mimics the over-the-top action of the latter but, sadly, has little of the former's charm.:::0:::C
Knight and Day is many good moments surrounded by unrealized potential.:::0:::2/4
In the traditional way, the story is a flimsy thing; and in the traditional way, that doesn't matter.:::1:::4/5
For its first hour it is a fast-moving fun lark of an action-comedy only to drop much of its good will in the second half to become a generic package with little-to-no surprises in store for its audience.:::0:::2.5/4
We've seen all this before in any number of disposable Hollywood products, but there's something particularly odious about it here given Cruise and Diaz's black-hole lack of chemistry.:::0:::1/5
There's no kinetic rhythm, no From Paris With Love energy or craft, no Jonah Hex wit -- only a distorted, distended James Bondish marathon chase.:::0:::None
A frivolous, fast-moving, globetrotter of a summer blockbuster that's more glamorous and fun than it is clever and intricate.:::1:::2.5/4
The "all in a day's work" cheerfulness with which Roy chats up June as he racks up an ever-higher body count, meant to be funny, comes off as is off-putting, at least if he's meant to be the good guy.:::0:::C-
Exotic, edgy espionage escapade, delivering an exhilarating if exhausting thrill ride.:::1:::7/10
One character gets knocked out so many times it feels like she spends half the movie unconscious. I don't blame her. I wish I'd spent the entire thing that way.:::0:::3/10
The premise is tired, the tone doesn't exactly work, and I honestly still have no idea why it's called Knight and Day.:::0:::2.5/5
The movie... get(s) saved by the surprising charm and easy rapport generated by Cruise and Diaz as an odd couple bouncing from one exotic locale to another...:::1:::3/5
Knight and Day may have generic characters doing generic things in generic situations, but it's got Movie Stars with huge white smiles looking pretty and being blandly inoffensive in exotic foreign locales.:::0:::None
Together, (Cruise and Diaz) form an almost irresistible combination that saves some rather sloppy plotting.:::1:::3.5/5
Too much of it stretches credibility too far -- yes, even for a film designed to do just that -- and thus feels like the filmmakers took the easy way out and/or didn't have what it takes to make a smart, mindless movie. (Parental Review also Available):::0:::None
Overall, Knight and Day succeeds in its modest aspiration to provide light, fun summer entertainment.:::1:::3/4
By the time Knight and Day establishes its real intentions and the plot begins to ride its preordained rails, that sense of playfulness is muted for the ordinary.:::0:::2.5/4
Few things in the cinema are more annoying than the sight of a film insisting upon its own cutesiness and this one practically leaps off the screen and grabs you by the lapels in its efforts to do just that.:::0:::2/5
This fusion of action romance and comedy leaves out one very key element: fun.:::0:::None
Grindingly conventional yet not without some grandly loopy, even bizarre, occurrences, one questions at times whether the film is attempting to be avant garde. It's not, though. It's just pieced together more incoherently than usual.:::0:::2/4
Knight and Day is a high-functioning entertainment machine, guaranteed to please just about everyone who isn't determined to be grumpy.:::1:::3/4
The locales are luxe, the banter witty, the bullets fly.:::1:::3/4
It's intended to be enjoyable without overtaxing the brain, and it easily achieves that goal.:::1:::3/4
Cruise and Diaz are both easy to look at and they work well together.:::1:::3.5/5
The movie is based in America, but travels to Spain and Austria, locations that were evidently chosen for tax considerations and not for any serious filmmaking intent.:::0:::2/4
It's lightweight but enjoyable summer fun.:::1:::2.5/4
It just keeps charging forward, jumping from continent to continent, introducing villains in shifts (including the shifty villain Peter Sarsgaard) and blowing things up with panache.:::1:::None
It's a quintessential movie hybrid: a romantic thriller with exciting high-speed chases, brisk comedy and exotic scenery.:::1:::3/4
If you doubt Cruise's skills in the star department, Knight and Day should make you a believer.:::1:::3.5/5
The movie not only borderline satirizes the Bourne and James Bond series, but also Cruise's own screen persona.:::1:::3/5
Sadly, everything is much simpler than it seems.:::0:::C-

Stays afloat on the strength of its leads even as the plot gets sillier and the 110 minute runtime has you fidgeting in your seat.:::1:::3/5
Their effortless charm gives off enough sizzle to keep things going between stunts.:::1:::B+
A stylish, globe-hopping, action-packed comedy that starts at full blast and never lets up. Cruise hasn't been this loose and comfortable on screen in a long time.:::1:::3.5/5
Knight and Day rises or falls on how you feel about the body-and-soul chemistry between Cruise and Diaz, who first teamed in 2001's Vanilla Sky... their teasing and one-upmanship are more brother and sister at play than lovers in heat.:::0:::2/4
If you thought "Killers" was bad, well this one is worse. Cocky Cruise and dim Diaz add no star luster.:::0:::3/10
At least they're not Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher in Killers.:::0:::C+
It's both straight-faced spy film and sly spy spoof. That's a difficult balancing act, but director James Mangold exactly right.:::1:::3/4
Patrick O'Neill's script is so convinced of its own cleverness, you'll be halfway through before you wonder if you're missing something. You're not.:::0:::2.5/5
A loud, seemingly interminable, and altogether incoherent entry in the preposterous and proliferating "action-comedy" genre.:::0:::1/5
Knight and Day is by no means a period piece, but it's certainly dated -- another '80s flashback, this time to the Classic Coke version of Tom Cruise.:::0:::C
One of those movies that requires you to accept that every single time a character is presented with a choice, he or she will make the worst and most inexplicable one.:::0:::1.5/4
The entertainment comes from how much fun it is watching [Cruise and Diaz] on screen together and that's what separates Knight and Day from previous attempts at mixing romance, comedy, and action.:::1:::8/10
The movie's a piece of high-octane summer piffle: stylish, funny, brainless without being too obnoxious about it, and Cruise is its manic animating principle.:::1:::2.5/4
Tom Cruise is no longer cool, a truth he just can't face -- if he could, he'd be cooler.:::0:::None
Knight and Day is ultimately too relentlessly silly for its own good.:::0:::C+
Knight and Day is an action comedy that works. But it's also a surprisingly poignant romance. This is the summer flick you've been waiting for.:::1:::3.5/4
Tons of fun. Cruise is great, and Diaz can still rock a bikini!:::1:::8/10
A director and a couple of movie stars, however, can go only so far on fumes.:::0:::1.5/4
The Last Exorcism is completely boring, devoid of any scares, tension or unease and has one of the worst endings ever. Avoid at all costs.:::0:::2/10
It's disappointing--if not exactly surprising--when at the halfway point the film turns into THE LINDA BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.:::0:::2.5/4
A fairly absorbing pseudo-documentary demonic-possession flick with all the bodily contortions and jittery camerawork you'd expect.:::1:::3/5
Even if you take "The Last Exorcism" on its own terms, you're going to be in for quite an uneventful movie.:::0:::2/4
Its mature focus on characterization really sets the film apart.:::1:::None
The seams are obvious in this faux documentary, but the thrills are fairly genuine.:::1:::7/10
If you make a film about exorcism, you better be ready to be compared to one of the best films ever made. Surprisingly, the film holds its own in that regard.:::1:::3.5/5
Does a great job of sustaining tension by distracting you with (get this) interesting characters and a novel approach.:::1:::4/5
...ultimately fares a whole lot better in its first half than in its second...:::1:::2.5/4
The Last Exorcism is a tasty slice of religious themed exploitation of little innovation, yet with plenty of thrills.:::1:::3.5/5
Unfortunately the predictable and unoriginal finale undermines the overall impact.:::0:::None
If you're not too found-footaged out after two Paranormal Activities in the past year, The Last Exorcism is sure to be good for a bad, shaky-cam fright or three.:::1:::3/5
The Last Exorcism is a rare reminder that the genre label "horror" derives from the word horrifying, not horrible.:::1:::4.5/5
A perfectly acceptable, rather low key addition to the horror-mockumentary genre, following a fraudulent Pastor who's decided to allow a camera crew to film one last job extracting the devil from an innocent girl.:::1:::2.5/5
Unfortunately, at about the half-way point, the brittle mood so carefully created by the single-camera coverage is broken by multi-camera editing and the overlaying of creepy music, just like in standard horror fare.:::0:::2/5
The viewer is placed squarely in the position of anonymous documentarian in this charmingly comic, ably performed, surprisingly sincere and often chilling first-person funhouse of a film.:::1:::4/5
The climax owes a debt to a seminal 1960s horror film which it would be unfair to name -- suffice it to say the comparison doesn't do The Last Exorcism any favours.:::0:::None
The conceit of the premise is entirely plausible and there is enough character establishment in the preparatory scenes to build engagement on a deeper level.What's more, it has something of a twist at the end:::1:::None
full review at Movies for the Masses:::1:::3.5/5
More than a decade after The Blair Witch project turned the mock-doc format into a horror cliche, this low-tech horror show uses it to chilling effect in this story of cynicism vs. things that go bump in the night.:::1:::None
The denouement is a letdown, but the faux-documentary premise brings a fresh twist to a tired horror subgenre.:::1:::2.5/4
At last, a possession movie for lapsed horror acolytes to believe in.:::1:::4/5
Slow-burning and well acted it's intriguing without being especially terrifying...:::1:::None
"The Last Exorcism" Starts Out as a Sharp Religious Satire But Kind of Forgets That When Angling for "Paranormal Activity" Scares.:::1:::3/5
A spare demonic possession drama that wrings plenty of spooky and often amusing engagement out of its set-up, but is crucially undone by editorial choices which betray its mock-doc framework.:::0:::2.5/5
the devil remains in the details as to whether this ends up being just another film about satanic goings-on, or a work of multi-layered charlatanism designed to give us, in return for our money, precisely the cathartic treatment that we desire.:::1:::None
Oh come on now...this is garbage.:::0:::1.5/5
Exorcism Genuinely Frightening Despite Ending:::1:::3.0/4.0
Yet another Blair Witch wannabe, The Last Exorcism sets up a relationship between on-screen speakers and "you," addressed as such.:::0:::None
Any film that forges as unruly a connection as this one does with its audience deserves some applause, especially when the film belongs to a genre where all too many of its peers come across as rote or as thoughtlessly, remorselessly heartless.:::1:::B
It's quite refreshing to see a horror movie with high-quality performances like Patrick Fabian and Ashley Bell deliver here.:::1:::None
The only thing finally astonishing about The Last Exorcism is its goofiness.:::0:::1/5
A clever, small film that depicts showman-preachers and horror movies with a wink and nod, The Last Exorcism spends most of its 88 minutes staying a cut above the average horror flick.:::1:::3/4
A few good scenes, and a decent performance by Fabian, but standard hokum for the most part.:::0:::2/5
When I left the theater, I was exhausted and freaked out and totally bejeezus-less.:::1:::3/4
The characters are better than in any of the other pseudo-documentary films.:::1:::None
Stamm effectively crafts a dozen or so marvellously creepy moments. Audience faith in the existence of decent horror films is reaffirmed.:::1:::4/5
Another cheap horror film dressed up like a documentary.:::0:::1/5
Draws on The Blair Witch Project and The Exorcist to supremely creepy effect.:::1:::4/5
Ultimately comes across as a bizarre coupling of This is Spinal Tap and Rosemary's Baby.:::1:::3/5
The latest entry in the pseudo-documentary horror film sweepstakes, The Last Exorcism has its terrifying moments and its silly ones.:::1:::B-
the proliferation of similarly framed horror movies makes this one feel all the more derivative and overly familiar:::0:::2.5/4
Something that helps distinguish The Last Exorcism is the care with which it sets out its stall.:::1:::4/5
The direction and performances are solid enough to hold the attention right up to the maddeningly mishandled ending.:::1:::3/5
The method is well-worn and the subject-matter familiar, but this is a smart, scary little picture.:::1:::4/5
The credibility of faux-documentary filmmaking relies on clear plotting and convincing, semi-improvised acting.:::1:::3/5
The opening 20 minutes offer a brilliant insight into the world of an evangelical minister who is being filmed for a documentary.:::1:::3/5
Anyone with a decent knowledge of horror flicks will surely recoil in terror at how terribly several masterpieces of the genre have been shamelessly ripped off.:::0:::2/5
Very much an Exorcist for our times.:::1:::None
What follows is a masterclass in merciless, gut-twisting terror. But The Last Exorcism also knows when to hold back.:::1:::4/5
The finale may come out of nowhere -- you probably won't see it coming -- but this can (un) happily join The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity as superior horror.:::1:::3/5
Neither as good as I'd hoped, nor as bad I'd feared -- nor as unintentionally funny as the trailer -- The Last Exorcism is a pretty good little horror picture.:::1:::3.5/5
Satan stalks the bible belt, as the occult locks horns so to speak, with free lance forensics, family dysfunction, and more sociopathic urges. And a not too hip Lucifer who thinks he's offering a doubting demon buster man of the cloth a 'blowing job.':::1:::None
Brilliantly directed, superbly written and genuinely scary, this is a hugely enjoyable horror flick with a terrific, star-making central performance from Patrick Fabian.:::1:::4/5
Eli Roth-produced frighter looks neat, but that's it:::0:::C-
These are very assured strides into the mainstream from director Daniel Stamm, and he's certainly guaranteed himself a few enticing offers when the time for his next film comes around.:::1:::4/5
Despite some solid acting from Fabian and Bell the convoluted plot becomes silly and predictable at the end.:::0:::3/10
(The film) is at its best when it poses as many practical as theological explanations...thought-provoking and intense until the over-the-top, Blair Witch-y finale.:::1:::B
Hardcore gore-hounds will be disappointed by the lack of flashy special effects, but The Last Exorcism is more concerned with psychological chills and succeeds admirably in evoking them.:::1:::None
A textbook example of fumbling the ball on the goal line.:::0:::C+
Then it comes, the make-or-break ending that had a theater full of teenagers on a Saturday night commenting on its stupidity. I joined them in spirit.:::1:::3/5
...precisely the sort of disposable trash horror film that we've come to expect at the end of the summer...:::0:::1/5
A mockumentary with a Blair Witch Project-like shaky hand-held camera.:::0:::C+
Superior storytelling mixed with masterful misdirection. The devil is (quite literally) in the details.:::1:::3.5/4.0
a thoroughly enjoyable thrill ride, enough to keep you scared when you go home and try to go asleep with all the lights out and the house going bump in the night:::1:::3.5/5
Daniel Stamm's The Last Exorcism is one of the most interesting and accomplished horror debuts of the last few years.:::1:::4/5
Horror flick fans will struggle with the preacher, a camera guy and the producer sticking around as the possession gets more frightening and more violent. But that's horror.:::1:::3.5/5
A nice little late-summer surprise, a horror film with a shred of intelligence and uncommonly good performances.:::1:::3/4
The Last Exorcism takes the best elements from 'The Exorcist' and 'The Blair Witch Project,' but the ending is scary for all the wrong reasons.:::1:::3/4
Riddled with poor lighting, inappropriate use of music, and a plot you could fit in a tea cup, "The Last Exorcism" has all the appeal of a glorified, but poorly shot, student film.:::0:::D
Though sharply uneven and marred by a compromised ending, this cheaply-made horror flick still manages to be creepy for half of its time and provocative in its ideas about religion, faith, and the very medium of film.:::1:::B-
The prospect of journeying to Hell and back seems less daunting than sitting through another horror yarn made in the faux-documentary style of The Blair Witch Project, but The Last Exorcism proves to be a pleasant surprise.:::1:::3/4
the terror it evokes is of such a primal nature, that it is not easily thrown off, burrowing relentlessly into the very marrow on one's bones, and into the deepest, darkest part of one's psyche:::1:::4/5
[A]bsolutely worth seeing... if only for the intriguing debate to be had afterward, if it wouldn't be an even stronger film were the last five minutes or so to be chopped off.:::1:::None
Although the ramshackle closing moments leave something to be desired, overall The Last Exorcism has done a decent job of creating tension without becoming too telegraphed.:::1:::3.5/5
Is "The Last Exorcism" this generation's version of "The Exorcist"? No, it comes across more like an unholy hybrid of "The Blair Witch Project" and "The Exorcism of Emily Rose.":::1:::None
A creepy, smartly written and very entertaining low-budget chiller.:::1:::3/4
It pulled the rug out from under me. I left surprised and smiling.:::1:::3.5/5
Resorts to a cliched and over-the-top ending that negates all of the effective ambiguity that made the middle third of the film so nail-bitingly tense.:::0:::2.5/5
I really liked The Last Exorcism. Surprised the heck out of me.:::1:::3/5
A worthy addition to the horror climate.:::1:::7.5
The movie loses points for being one of the later examples of a now-familiar genre, but it does have a highly charismatic flawed hero in Fabian's Cotton Marcus.:::1:::3/5
For the most part, The Last Exorcism is an unconventional and fairly satisfying horror film.:::1:::3/5
The Last Exorcism is as much a mystery about our faith in religion (and movies) as it is trying to make us squirm in our seats.:::1:::3/4
The movie loses points for being one of the later examples of a now-familiar genre, but it does have a highly engaging and charismatic flawed hero, as well as a fine performance by television actor Patrick Fabian.:::1:::3/4
The Last Exorcism refuses to conform to expectations by remaining ambiguous about the exact nature of the horror at hand instead of plunging straight into FX-laden freakiness.:::1:::4/5
An unusually restrained and genuinely eerie little movie perched at the intersection of faith, folklore and female puberty.:::1:::4/5
The film is like enjoying a beautifully tender filet mignon where every bite is delicious. But, at the end you find a disgusting fungus-filled toe nail on the plate.:::0:::2/5
It's fun and it will have you jumping out of your underpants.:::1:::3.5/4
Stamm creates an anxious psychological horror that's vaguely familiar yet refreshingly original.:::1:::3/4
The Last Exorcism is fueled by the arrogance of its smarmy outsider, the expert who knows everything except what an ass he is.:::1:::2.5/4
The pseudo-documentary premise is paper-thin at the outset and wears out long before Botko and Gurland's script lurches toward the dumbest and least plausible solution to the mystery.:::0:::None
This is the rare horror film that would have been entertaining even if nothing scary happened.:::1:::3/4
For the first three quarters of its running time, The Last Exorcism positively purred and then, as it rounded the final lap, the film completely ruined any good feelings I had for it with a diabolically stupid ending.:::0:::3/10
A decently constructed little horror pic that had me constantly amused and entertained throughout, be that from regular and haunted house type laughs and scares. (Parental Review also Available):::1:::None
A tense and generally understated chiller that might creep you right the hell out.:::1:::B
It's human-scaled horror, which is rare enough these days, and enough of it works that The Last Exorcism lingers long after the debate about what is or isn't "real" wraps up.:::1:::None
Suspenseful, surprising, somewhat terrifying and clever despite its rushed, lazy conclusion.:::1:::7.0/10
Horror movies these days are so often frivolous -- formulaic larks calculated to provide mechanical thrills. Here's one that delivers an experience.:::1:::B+
But producer Eli Roth's The Last Exorcism doesn't reconcile the real identity crisis: a script that can't stop making jokes, undermining the scary stuff with too many giggles and not enough shrieks.:::0:::C+
The scenes of Nell's possession have been done before, but it hardly matters in light of the attention to character in The Last Exorcism.:::1:::3.5/4
Fabian never makes a false move. Neither does Stamm, who understands that what's left off-screen is often more terrifying than what's on it.:::1:::3.5/4
The finale is where the biggest problems come in, but director Daniel Stamm is fully capable of ratcheting up a sense of eerie disquiet and mounting tension.:::1:::2.5/4
The Last Exorcism's cynical take on faith is worse than pandering, it's ineffective.:::0:::2.5/5
'The Exorcist' meets 'The Blair Witch Project' and gives birth to 'Rosemary's Baby'...a cheesy horror movie in the now commonplace verite style that manages a few easy jolts but overall isn't very scary.:::0:::C-
It never loses sight of its characters and making sure that the audience remains invested in them through all the hell that follows.:::1:::3.5/5
Mostly good fun if only for the sentiment expressed by a colleague and shared by a big contingent of horror fans: "I'm always up for a nice exorcism movie.":::1:::2.5/4
I like that director Daniel Stamm tries to con me with faux supernatural realism in the same way Cotton tries to con the girl he's "exorcising.":::1:::B
A man very much of these times, Cotton is that rarity in the horror genre: a genuinely intriguing character.:::1:::None
The Last Exorcism stirs up a caldron of handheld-camera technique, faith-challenged drama and solid acting for a suitably squirmy tale of demonic possession.:::1:::3.5/5
It's easy to sum up what's wrong with The Last Exorcism -- nothing happens:::0:::1/5
Satan gets behind The Last Exorcism in a fiendishly clever plot that starts out creepily enthralling, then collapses in a heap.:::0:::None
The Last Exorcism pulls off its sweetly scary magic trick with great style and panache.:::1:::3/4
An ill-considered, laughably dumb coda sequence only compounds Exorcism's numerous problems.:::0:::1/4
It's like director Daniel Stamm and his crew realized they were treading awfully close to making a film with real depth and edge that horror audiences might hate, and they just couldn't pull the trigger.:::0:::2/4
While Daniel Stamm doesn't reinvent the form with the low-budget pseudo-doc The Last Exorcism, he exploits it well.:::1:::B
At my tent revival, I'll pray The Last Exorcism goes platinum.:::1:::5/5
Suspense is nil, phoniness abounds...:::0:::2/5
In its eagerness to deliver familiar genre pleasures, it somehow misplaces its soul.:::0:::None
That this comes via minimal special effects is admirable, but the movie also cheats a bit: Tinkly piano music is layered onto the spooky moments, which kills the faux-doc "realism.:::0:::1/5
Every generation gets the devil it deserves, and this faux documentary pulls few punches in its nihilistic depiction of religious belief vs. religious disbelief.:::1:::3.5/5
A lean and witty variation on the documentary-gone-wrong theme.:::1:::B+
It's difficult to find an ending for horror movies. Often the getting there is the fun. That's especially true here.:::1:::3.5/5
If you ignore the marketing, this is actually a clever and creepy (if ultimately pointless) little thriller possessed by the soul of a horror movie.:::1:::2.5/4
It's not just the hand-held camera that will shake you up. The Last Exorcism gives you good reason to be very afraid of the dark.:::1:::3/4
The cast is effective, with everyone sliding believably into their roles.:::1:::2.5/4
The purity of the docu conceit falls apart thanks to the intrusion of a spooky score and deliberately eerie camera shots.:::0:::2/4
Doesn't know how to integrate its sillier supernatural elements into the realistic format.:::0:::2.5/5
A horror film for the Christian fundamentalist set, The Last Exorcism employs the aesthetic of The Blair Witch Project for a musty demonic-possession tale that promotes strict, anti-modern doctrinal faith as the most righteous path.:::0:::2/4
Boasts a steadier camera, a smarter screenplay and a more fascinating lead performance than [The Blair Witch Project had].:::1:::None
Why should I care if no effort or skill is used to generate sympathy for the film's characters or make us identify with them. "The Last Exorcism" is a film without a heart.:::0:::D
The Last Exorcism is one of the scariest movies to come along in a long time -- until the last five minutes or so, when it completely falls apart.:::1:::None
A muddled pass at realism, with scoring cues helping to goose the suspense, a cast of established actors indicating up a storm when they sense the camera is locked on them, and a general cheating of angles to capture the dark magic.:::0:::D+
Demons and rednecks form a terrifying tag-team in this creepy 'Exorcist'/'Blair Witch Project' mash-up.:::1:::3/5
The more hellish the story gets, the sillier and less involving the movie becomes.:::0:::2/4
Director Daniel Stamm and his screenwriters studiously keep a lid on the proceedings, only letting short puffs of steam escape as the tension mounts.:::1:::None
It's about the dark side of piety -- the cultish wrath that can emerge out of the high and the mighty. At the center of it all, once again, is a teenage girl's gnashing wrath.:::1:::B
A modestly chilling, drawn out affair in which the characters and possible "scientific explanations" are more interesting than its predictable final destination.:::0:::2/4
Creepy, disturbing fun... and very surprising in the way it handles the subject matter differently than how it's been handled in the past.:::1:::8/10
Sturdy entry in the ever growing horror mockumentary genre ... benefits from better acting and more clever ideas than usual in the typically one-note films.:::1:::3/5
A smart horror film will fatten its pigs before the slaughter, and the mock doc The Last Exorcism feeds its prize hog nicely.:::1:::3/5
With a small, well-chosen cast, sly script, and slippery, ambivalent characters, The Last Exorcism gives a welcome titty-twist to the demonic-possession movie revival.:::1:::None
As taut and economical a horror film as I've seen in a long time...a gripping little movie that will give you the willies.:::1:::A-
I'm Still Here is a picture of spoiled entitlement, but its real impressiveness comes with its unusually mature sense of pacing.:::1:::5/5
Increasingly annoying, deluded, mumbling narcissism. Joaquin Phoenix may still be here, somewhere, but I no longer care.:::0:::2/5
There's a thrilling madness to Phoenix's Method.:::1:::None
Like a pair of po-faced co-conspirators, Affleck and Phoenix have cooked up an audacious little distraction; a stage-managed Hollywood Babylon that's at once gaudily entertaining and willfully self-indulgent.:::1:::3/5
The film is made up of half-formed sketches in which Phoenix comes across like a childish crank who's escaped from his soap box at Speakers' Corner.:::0:::2/5
This film gives us more access than the most inquisitive tabloid magazines into Phoenix's world. By doing so, it makes us question and even become a little ashamed about our own voyeurism.:::1:::3/5
Rarely has the question of a documentary's artifice mattered less. I genuinely hated this picture, almost as much as I've admired Phoenix's work.:::0:::0/4
Perhaps it goes without saying that Here was more provocative when it couldn't be seen, when it existed for most of us purely in the realm of rumor.:::0:::None
It's not well-done technically -- the image and sound are bad -- but it has the advantage of access to private and tormented moments.:::1:::3/4
Joaquin Phoenix and Casey Affleck push the edges of celebrity spoof in a mockumentary worth watching.:::1:::None
An utterly fascinating experiment that apparently blends real and faked material to examine notions of celebrity, mental stability and friendship.:::1:::None
In the great Joaquin debate -- is he crazy like a loon, or like a fox? -- the smart Hollywood money is on fox.:::1:::None
Ultimately the film seems like a stale idea and its celebrity filmmakers too close to -- and forgiving of -- celebrities to really deliver a hard critique.:::0:::None
:::0:::None
A predictable but sweet old-fashioned teen romance.:::1:::3.0/5
Cyrus and Hemsworth... represent some kind of theoretical low for how terrible two romantic leads can be, together and separately.:::0:::2/10
It's an entire season's worth of a teen soap opera crammed into a feature film.:::0:::None
Here's the revelation: Miley Cyrus is a really interesting movie star in the making, with an intriguing echo-of-foghorn speaking voice, and a scuffed-up tomboyish physicality (in the Kristen Stewart mode) that sets her apart from daintier girls.:::1:::B
The latest in a growing number of weepy films based on Nicholas Sparks novels that don't come anywhere close to The Notebook.:::0:::None
This film is kind of a brilliant move on the part of the Cyrus Corporation.:::0:::1.5/5
How do I find thee ridiculous, The Last Song? Let me count the ways...[Blu-ray]:::0:::1.5/4
As a vehicle to extend the Miley Cyrus $$$billion$$$ dollar phenomenon of pre-teen fandom into a young adult starlet of seventeen, no production value was denied. But it ain't this year's discovery!:::0:::2.5/5
A melodrama that's aimed at teen girls, but the cinematography and performances make it palatable for others as well--if you don't mind someone toying with your emotions.:::0:::6/10
full review at Movies for the Masses:::0:::1/5
This is piano-key-tinkling melodrama that pulls out just about every cliche in the book.:::0:::1.5/5
An obvious bid for the teen queen to extend beyond her comfort zone only to then clearly show her limits and need for further development.:::0:::0/4
As Nicholas Sparks adaptations go, this one's both endearingly join-the-dots and surprisingly un-crass.:::0:::2/5
Novelist Sparks turns screenwriter with this film, which combines his usual themes (beaches, grieving teens, cancer) as a vehicle for Cyrus to put her childhood career behind her. It's exactly what we expect, but it's also fairly watchable.:::1:::3/5
Peddles banal truisms ("Love is fragile, and we're not always the best caretakers!") as if they're freshly minted.:::0:::2/4
The Georgia locations are handsome and the people are pretty but any resemblance to real life is purely coincidental.:::0:::2/5
Miley Cyrus makes a pathetic attempt to demonstrate her non-existent dramatic skills in this latest Nicholas Sparks-penned story.:::0:::1/5
The "last song"? In all conscience, that should really have been Billy Ray's Achy Breaky Heart in a brooding minor key. You'll feel the ache and hear the break.:::0:::1/5
Disney starlet Miley Cyrus becomes an early contender for worst actress of the decade in this painful attempt at a romantic tear-jerker.:::0:::1/5
While it's quite watchable, The Last Song doesn't feel like a film that's been made so much as assembled from standard teen movie cliches.:::1:::3/5
Honest and disarming, although with the obligatory Sparks pathos.:::1:::3/5
Anyone but Cyrus fans will find this one of the more inferior Sparks adaptations -- and yes, that includes Nights in Rodanthe.:::0:::2/5
It's pretty watchable, mainly thanks to strong performances from Kinnear and Coleman. Cyrus, sadly, fails to convey a broken heart.:::1:::3/4
The Last Song is a movie that quite deliberately slots together its jigsaw pieces to take its audience on an expected and overly-sentimental ride.:::0:::2/5
The Last Song, from Miley Cyrus. If only we lived in a world where movie titles were legally binding.:::0:::2/5
The jury is still out on Cyrus's ability to sustain her screen career over the longer term, but this is respectable enough as a first step in that direction.:::1:::3/5
Death can't come quickly enough.:::0:::1/5
Watchable drama that never strays too far from the Nicholas Sparks formula but succeeds thanks to likeable performances from Miley Cyrus and Greg Kinnear.:::1:::3/5
The Last Song ultimately proves to be a far more engaging piece of work than the viewer might've initially suspected.:::1:::2.5/4
Cyrus has the potential to play truly adult roles, but she'll need a director who's looking out for an involving story and not just protecting Disney's brown-haired franchise.:::0:::2/4
'Clunky, one paced and mostly off key' not only describes Hemsworth's intentionally bad singing in The Last Song but also the film.:::0:::2/5
The ending is contrived, it's true. But I had a good time getting there in Nicholas Sparks' 'The Last Song.':::1:::3/4
Movies made from Nicholas Sparks' books often have their nice moments and their moments where the sentimentality goes overboard.:::1:::2.5/4
Watching her graduate into mature roles is like watching a 17-year-old girl graduate from high school: So young, so full of promise, so little idea how to act like a grown-up.:::0:::1/4
This being a Nicholas Sparkes' project you know that there will be sentiment galore, a teary finale, romance and reconciliation. So no surprises here. But there are a couple of elements that add a bit of ballast to this film.:::1:::3/5
A typical Sparks tearjerker but with more depth and emotion; Cyrus is fine in the lead role.:::1:::7/10
Interminable:::0:::1.5/5
OMG movies are so unfair!:::0:::None
The big deal here is Cyrus' first serious [on-screen] kiss. The lip locking is about as romantic as two fish gobbling at the same piece of food.:::0:::2/5
Cyrus does not disappoint her fans and makes a smooth transition from comedy to drama. The movie's main drawback is that it compresses everything, leaving no breathing room in its under two-hour running time. Those wishing to spend more time with the cha:::1:::3/4
"The Last Song" hits the big bong of banality early on, and it never recovers.:::0:::D-
Let's not be too rough on [Miley Cyrus]: It's hard to put one's best foot forward when dealing with a script that's the literary equivalent of cement shoes.:::0:::1.5/4
The Last Song is filled with great heart and chemistry but is ultimately destroyed by its cliches and cheesy moments.:::0:::2.5/5
Any of the novelty in seeing Disney's crowned princess tricked out in combat boots and blue nail polish is negated by the absolute joylessness and lack of charisma Cyrus brings to the role.:::0:::4.5/10
Even for one not averse to some sentimental uplift in romantic movies, it's all a bit much. In fact, it's much too much.:::0:::2.5/5
The kind of bathetic and overwrought melodrama that Sandra Dee might have rejected a half-century ago for being too schmaltzy for its own good.:::0:::None
It's understandable why Cyrus would want to show she's capable of more than bubbly effervescence. But by overreaching, she only draws attention to her limitations as an actress while curtailing her own natural appeal.:::0:::1.5/5
The Last Song is predictable, exactly what you expect it to be.:::0:::2/4
Just because I'm not a fan of Nicholas Sparks isn't going to stop me from recommending The Last Song to its target audience.:::0:::2.5/5
Sinks in its own excessive melodrama.:::0:::1/5
Sweet Miley Cyrus drama depicts first love, family troubles.:::0:::2/5
It's like Dante and Beatrice all over again, with the Georgia coast standing in for Paradise.:::0:::2/5
Anything more labored than stolen kisses, paternal resentment, and gorgeous beachside cinematography grinds the whole endeavor to a disappointing halt.:::0:::C
Cyrus manages to make you forget the broad slapstick she plays as Disney's poster girl and instead conveys genuine adolescence surliness.:::1:::2.5/5
Sadly, without a single note of originality, Last Song is an awfully long and tiresome tune.:::0:::1.5/4
The movie moves Ms. Cyrus from where she was to more or less where she and her handlers wanted to be, and Mr. Kinnear's musician father, Steve, adds a generous measure of grace.:::1:::None
Miley Cyrus is/too tall to be Hannah now,/ so she makes Sparks fizzle.:::0:::2/5
The tears are jerked gracelessly and methodically. But this is what you want in a Nicholas Sparks movie starring Miley Cyrus, right?:::0:::C-
Cyrus, with her gruff voice and slightly awkward overbite, dressed like a typical rock chick outsider, plays one ballsy young woman. The film convinced me less.:::0:::None
This is Miley's first dramatic role, and it proves that she should stick with her popular TV character.:::0:::None
So bad it makes The Notebook look like Casablanca.:::0:::0/4
This is Miley's vehicle, but the strongest scenes are between Kinnear and Coleman.:::0:::C
It seems we're stuck in the middle with Miley. She's not ready to be a dramatic lead, and her core audience will be bored with this typical Sparks story.:::0:::3/10
Years on the Hannah Montana TV series have not adequately prepared Miley Cyrus for screen acting, even in a vehicle as unchallenging as this adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel.:::0:::None
The girls who've grown up adoring Miley Cyrus as TV's teenage Hannah Montana will undoubtedly flock to see their heroine in her first "adult" dramatic film.:::0:::None
Sparks has said he wrote this whole shebang for Cyrus, so it's maybe unfair to ask more from a film that's clearly a vehicle. No need to make a star push the boundaries when you can set up another shot of her pouting into the sun, wind whipping her hair.:::0:::C-
The film is engineered to entice tween female moviegoers and repel everyone else.:::0:::1.5/4
While the movie will probably rake in big bucks from her built-in fan base (and their moms), the decision to showcase her dramatic chops may not have been in Cyrus' best long-term interest.:::0:::1.5/5
Yes, it's Hannah Montana as a cynical brooder, and no, the movie does not pull it off.:::0:::1/5
[Cyrus is] believable as Ronnie partly because she, too, is 17 and at a crossroads in her life.:::1:::2.5/4
Cyrus' acting ability makes Veronica's emotional make-over work.:::1:::None
The role requires Cyrus to spend the first half of the movie glaring, the second half crying. If acting were weeping, she'd be well on her way to a robust screen career.:::0:::C
For those wondering if the continuing popularity of such exercises might make this one worth the ticket price, the same effect might be achieved by writing names and obstacles (make some tragic) on index cards and tossing them in the air.:::0:::2.5/5
It might as well wear a 'kick-me' sign for critics, grouches and Internet trolls ... No matter: Its intended youngish, girlish audience should like it just fine, satisfied sniffles and all.:::1:::2.5/4
It's not surprising that in the hands of a first-time director and first-time screenwriter, nobody in this movie behaves like a recognizable human being, but it is surprising that Cyrus comes across as such an unlikable sourpuss.:::0:::None
Sparks also chips in as screenwriter, so he has no excuse for the messy result, and it doesn't help that director Julie Anne Robinson works the material like a pugilist throwing emotional kidney punches.:::0:::2.5/4
Huffing through the early scenes of The Last Song with black leather boots and a frozen pout, Miley Cyrus plays author Nicholas Sparks' idea of a rebel, which is to say Ned Flanders' idea of a rebel.:::0:::D
The one person here who doesn't embarrass himself is Kinnear. But it's hard to see what he saw in this project, aside from a fairly easy paycheck.:::0:::1.5/4
The Original Nicholas Sparks Romance Factory accomplishes its goals. The New Miley Cyrus Acting Company falls a bit shorter.:::0:::2.5/4
Television director Julie Anne Robinson's big-screen debut makes one thing clear: As likable a performer as she is, Cyrus simply can't act. Even Sparks' formulaic material proves too challenging for her.:::0:::1.5/4
Cyrus is ghastly in The Last Song, bad not just in one or two ways, but in all kinds of ways. It was a disservice to the audience, to the material and to Cyrus herself that she was put in this position.:::0:::1/4
The predictable plot mechanics aren't what make it insufferable. The big problem is Miley Cyrus.:::0:::None
Cyrus is game and appealing, but she's not nearly enough of a natural actress to pull off the emotional whip-cracks the story puts Ronnie through.:::0:::2/4
Cyrus, alas, hasn't yet learned not to act with her eyebrows and overbite. But she does show off her considerable chops as a pianist and remains reasonably likable throughout.:::0:::None
It's the worst of both worlds as Disney cash cow Miley Cyrus makes the most dubious "dramatic" debut of any singer since Britney Spears.:::0:::0/4
It's hard to believe this bland starlet is the same spunky kid who bounced through the Hannah Montana movie just last year, but it's only fair to cut Cyrus some slack.:::0:::2/5
The director, Julie Anne Robinson, makes sure that any scene that might culminate in thought or reflection instead becomes a montage set to music.:::0:::2/4
A dramatic showcase for a more grown-up Miley Cyrus, but not much more.:::0:::None
Perhaps feel-good tragedy doesn't quite capture it; feel-good sadism might be more like it.:::0:::2/4
Robinson is a sympathetic director of actors, allowing almost everyone their dignity. For the most part, she keeps this emotionally charged story in the schmaltz-free zone.:::1:::3/4
Fortunately, The Last Song mercifully avoids some of the cliches of its genre and will likely provide an unforgettably touching and wonderful film experience for the target teen girl audience that is bound to line up for it in droves.:::1:::3/5
All the obvious elements combine to manipulate the audience into a weepy time at the movies -- again.:::0:::2/4
Sand dunes at sunset, summer lovin' (had me a blast!), a third-act medical crisis and a clutch of letters designed to be read aloud in voice-over: Another month, another adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks romance.:::0:::2/4
The Cyrus machinery repels any believable human connection onscreen, though she's not helped much by Sparks and Van Wie's script.:::0:::None
It can't manage to sort through its various issues in any dramatically compelling way, instead falling into a slack, soap-opera rhythm in which potentially catastrophic developments seem to have no lasting emotional effects.:::0:::2/5
I like Miley Cyrus. I like her in spite of the fact that she's been packaged within an inch of her life.:::0:::2.5/4
...about on a par with the Mandy Moore starring "A Walk to Remember":::1:::B-
The Last Song is like one of those annoying tunes you've heard so many times before that when it comes on the radio, you immediately switch stations.:::0:::D-
In case you wondered: Little girls still scream for Miley Cyrus. You too may experience the need to scream, albeit for different reasons, should you take one (or more) of them to see The Last Song...:::0:::1/4
Teen sensation Miley Cyrus's bid for film stardom outside of her Hannah Montana persona gets off to a rocky start with The Last Song.:::0:::None
You can tell Miley Cyrus is trying to show her character is filled with dramatic, painful agony because she scrunches up her face like a Cabbage Patch Doll (or Renee Zellweger).:::0:::.5/4
Hopefully with this, his second critical flop within two months, Sparks will think thrice before hurting us again. This last song? A requiem.:::0:::1/10
If you laid all the cliches in 'The Last Song' end to end, they'd probably circle the globe several times over.:::0:::D
Maybe Douglas Sirk could have made something profound out of the pseudo-ennobling horsepucky.:::0:::2/5
Playing out like a comprehensive checklist of every convention ever touched upon in a romantic melodrama, the picture fails at activating the tear ducts but sure gets the ocular muscles working as the viewer's eyes roll from one side to the other.:::0:::1.5/4
Miley Cyrus must be stopped. Her emotional range includes happy and mad and nothing in between.:::0:::1.5/5
Cyrus has a likable, unforced screen presence but does not have the training or focus to show us any change more significant than the disappearance of the nose stud.:::0:::C
Parental Content Review:::0:::None
Like a band's greatest hits album, The Last Song touches upon just about every character and plot point Nicholas Sparks in his limited imagination has ever used in his storytelling.:::0:::1.5/4
In addition to a knack for corny plot lines and montages of young people making out along the Southeastern coastline, Sparks has a sixth sense for making audiences cry.:::1:::3/5
The best thing about this film is the way it continually subverts our expectations.:::1:::4/5
Self-possessed performances elevate this creepy but half-cocked faux-doc.:::1:::None
Doesn't need any viral campaign. It's a good movie.:::1:::None
It's hard to be frightened by something when you're too busy laughing at it.:::0:::5/10
The Last Exorcism makes first-rate use of religious doubt and religious extremism to concoct a novel horror-thriller clever enough to seduce unbelievers while satisfying the bloodlust of its congregation/fanbase.:::1:::None
:::1:::4/5
:::0:::None
Let Me In has a muddled storyline that never quite finds its focus. Every element here is just not as good as it was in the original, making this another pointless remake.:::0:::5/10
Let Me In is one of the few horror films that will trouble you long after the credits roll.:::1:::None
This version follows the plot and dialogue of its Swedish predecessor, capturing a tender (often blood-splattered) young relationship. But Reeves has upped the suspense and gore, creating a more Hollywood-friendly horror thriller.:::1:::3/4
Reeves' fresh vision and utterly compelling storytelling more than justify the making of this American iteration that could very well make a surprise appearance on year-end lists the way its predecessor did.:::1:::A-
With its mix of true-blood romance and full-moon madness, Let Me In should hasten the twilight of the twerpy pretenders.:::1:::None
Reeves, for the most part, delivers a film that's every bit as compelling as Alfredson's original.:::1:::3.5/4
Let Me In is a brilliantly effective horror film that is a thoroughly gripping and doesn't shirk from its supernatural chills.:::1:::None
The result, though no less creepy than the Swedish film, mislays its lyricism and otherworldliness.:::0:::None
This is one of the best films of its kind in the recent years. It's not better than the original, but that's not what Matt Reeves set out to do - the man wanted to make a solid film and he did just that.:::1:::None
In playing up the bullying, Reeves has Americanized a very good Swedish film without de-fanging it.:::1:::3.5/4
Vale la pena verla, por supuesto, pero mi mejor recomendacion seria ver (antes o despues) la version sueca. Puede ser incluso un interesante ejercicio de comparacion...:::1:::3/5
It doesn't have the emotional depth or resonance of the original, but it's a sutiable genre entry.:::1:::3/4
It's winter in Reagan's America...but wasn't it always?:::1:::None
There was no good reason for this movie to exist beyond a lazy American disinterest in subtitles. But having said that, it's pretty great on its own.:::1:::4/5
Let Me In is slow and thoughtful and its most chilling aspects require consideration after the fact by the viewer rather than simple thrills that wash over you viscerally and are just quickly gone.:::1:::8/10
This film makes me angry. Not because it's bad - I gave it four stars - but because it's unneccessary and shows up one of the biggest problems with Hollywood and audiences.:::1:::4/5
For anyone who can be bothered to read subtitles, it is essentially a pointless endeavour, but Let Me In has a strident regard for what made the original so enthralling...:::1:::3.5/5
Apesar de ser um esforco digno (e mesmo um otimo filme), soa apenas como uma empreitada comercial, nao como um projeto movido por ambicoes artisticas.:::1:::4/5
In many ways, Matt Reeves' vision is both more feral and more vulnerable than the Swedish original...:::1:::None
Reeves ramps up the action ... and spells out some things that were only hinted at by his Swedish precursor... but [his film] remains chilling and touching in equal measure.:::1:::None
In a world where on-screen adolescent vampires spew fluffy drivel about love and longing more often than puncturing carotid arteries with gleaming fangs, Let Me In is quite the raw, fresh, and meaty approach.:::1:::3/4
What becomes apparent is how well the story stands up, and how it still wreaks havoc with our moral compasses.:::1:::8/10
Unlike most remakes, this is just as good as the original, maybe even better.:::1:::B+
A solid vampire remake doubles as a solid work of cinematic vampirism.:::1:::B
Visceral, corroded, tender:::1:::None
On one hand it is probably the best vampire story ever to come from Hammer with the most interesting vampire plot... But is so similar a remake so soon really a film that is needed?:::1:::7/10
Joins Werner Herzog's Nosferatu and David Cronenberg's The Fly as one of the greatest horror movie remakes:::1:::4/5
The symbolism and undertones are nowhere to be found, but the highlights are the performances, and the atmosphere, both of which this film brings in droves.:::1:::None
Not as good as the original but able to stand on its own feet.:::1:::3.5/5
It may not have the depth or nuance of the original, but it's still a great story, stylishly told.:::1:::4/5
Another month, another teen vampire flick.:::0:::C
How to care and feed your very own vampire, or how to ensnare and manipulate your very own human?:::1:::3.0/4.0
it's impossible to deny that the subtlety has been dialled down by a good 5-10%... still, as Hollywood remakes go, a mere 5-10% is a good result.:::1:::3.5/5
To his credit, Cloverfield director Matt Reeves makes a good fist of this.:::1:::None
Let Me In remains a rare beast -- a strikingly original vampire thriller, remake or not.:::1:::5/5
Let Me In isn't as rich or daring as Let the Right One In and seldom improves on it -- but it plays better as a horror film, more concentrated in its focus on the creepy and shocking aspects of its unusual love story.:::1:::None
It's so reminiscent of the arthouse original you are tempted to say "why bother?" but for those coming new to the story it's a treat and, for my money, punchier and more compelling.:::1:::4/5
Although this merely reheats 95 per cent of the original, if you haven't seen that, then this is worth a bite.:::1:::4/5
To those who admired the Swedish vampire movie Let the Right One In this American remake will not cause offence, though it signally lacks the original's haunting impact.:::1:::3/5
A surprisingly personal reimagination that will shake up mainstream horror cinema.:::1:::4/5
I'm surprised Let Me In has received mostly enthusiastic reviews, for it is a dim-witted Hollywood remake of the acclaimed 2008 Swedish film Let The Right One In.:::0:::2/5
A very good film, slightly overpraised, has been remade as a slightly good film, very overpraised.:::1:::3/5
The Swedish original, Let the Right One In, was blanched, spooky and sombre. This remake by Matt Cloverfield Reeves misses almost everything.:::0:::2/5
This Americanisation of the elegantly eerie Swedish cult hit Let the Right One In is an honourable effort.:::1:::3/5
Matt Reeves' Let Me In may be a pointless exercise, but as pointless exercises go, it's not a bad effort.:::1:::3/5
What more could you want? Great reviews, awards-season glory, lousy ticket sales. Maybe Reeves made an art movie after all.:::1:::None
Not as deep as the original, but certainly more of a crowdpleaser -- and it's hard to imagine a more intelligent and well-crafted American horror being released this year.:::1:::4/5
A remake that in no way soils its source and stands on its own two bare feet as a classy, nerve-jangling slice of horror.:::1:::4/5
It's an impressive, thoughtful version with Reeves' reverence for his source material winning through and the performances of his two young leads well up to snuff.:::1:::4/5
Has the emotional depth to break your heart as well as stop it.:::1:::5/5
If we hadn't already seen it in Swedish, we'd probably be talking up Reeves' dark, gripping vampire remake -- and its two lead performances -- as something rather special. Actually, we're going to do that anyway.:::1:::4/5
Could teen torment ever be this moody?:::1:::B+
Let Me In is a fine film; well performed and (mostly) well made. But the only reason to see this instead of Let The Right One In is to avoid some subtitles.:::1:::3/5
...will seem a revelation to viewers who missed the limited release of the Swedish original.:::1:::4/5
Let Me In is simultaneously a joy and a disappointment.:::1:::3.5/5
... most of the story and characters -- and all of the creepy, unsettling mood -- remain intact ...:::1:::3/5
Let Me In deserves attention for its thoughtful rendition of adolescent torment and its restrained handling of the so-hot-right-now vampire genre. If that attention draws new fans to its top-shelf source material, all the better.:::1:::3/5
At best it's on a par with -- not better than -- its predecessor. Given how good Tomas Alfredson's film was, that's not a bad achievement.:::1:::None
Let Me In is a rare example of a film that gives remakes a good name.:::1:::3.5/5
It is a pleasure to report that Let Me In is a very good film. Both in its own right, and also out of respect to the original production.:::1:::4/5
Fails to add anything to set it apart and there's no reason to prefer this to the fine Swedish original.:::0:::None
Eerie, poetic and terrifying as a portrait of childhood need and vulnerability; still, the film's very existence is a sad judgment on the timidity of American moviegoers, whose aversion to subtitles justified this remake...:::1:::3.5/4
Let Me In is one of the finest American horror films of recent years. It may be a remake but, when it's this good, who cares? Bloody great!:::1:::4
Horror film, serial killer drama, revenge fantasy, or coming-of-age romance, Let Me In succeeds whichever way you want to look at it.:::1:::4/5
A beautifully understated story of young lovers played out with the dark side of vampire mythology as a backdrop that occasionally and shockingly intrudes.:::1:::4/5
Let Me In is a very accomplished thriller, perfectly brooding and moody without ever going over the top. Is it better than Let The Right One In? It doesn't matter, the film does more than enough to stand on its own two feet.:::1:::4/5
I think this is a very competent film. It just didn't match the original for me.:::1:::3.5/5
Stunningly photographed on wintry locations by Australia's talented Greig Fraser, the film is unnerving throughout, but it's more than just a horror film.:::1:::4/5
A watchable remake that captures the look and feel of the original and features terrific performances from its two young leads but it also strips out all the subtlety and complexity of the Swedish version in favour of more overt horror sequences.:::1:::4/5
as a remake, Let Me In can never really be seen in its own terms. It has nearly everything that filmgoers loved about Alfredson's Swedish original - except the originality.:::1:::None
On its own, the American adaptation is rather remarkable. It's an incredibly tense, artfully constructed and beautifully acted portrait of loneliness, nascent love and manipulation.:::1:::None
Compliments where they are due to director Reeves for bringing it all together. Turns out there's room in the world for more than one movie about vampires... who'd have thought it.:::1:::None
A thoughtful and compelling horror film boosted by the astounding performances of the two young lead actors.:::1:::None
If you don't want your vampires to sparkle, then 'Let Me In' is the movie for you.:::1:::3/4
It redresses the original with a keen eye and original perspective.:::1:::8/10
Moving and haunting, sometimes bloody but always deeply affecting, the story carries the eternal truth about human nature that Shakespeare captured so vividly in Romeo & Juliet:::1:::None
Shimmering with the same tremor as the Swedish original, this bitingly different vampire movie offers a similarly heart jolting experience:::1:::None
[Director Matt Reeves] manages to both stay true to and improve upon the Swedish original, notably in the climactic swimming-pool scene.:::1:::3.5/4
Haunting and tragic.:::1:::4/4
Let Me In mimics the mood and mastery of Alfredson?s original almost to the point where it's a shot for shot remake. Yes, it?s good. But only because the original was good to begin with.:::1:::3/5
It?s still just an efficient imitation of a superior film, and it?s largely superfluous.:::1:::3.5/5
Beautifully shot, sensitively directed, and elegantly scripted, it is a horror movie with the kind of substance and depth that 99% of genre fare lacks. It lingers in your mind and your heart.:::1:::3.5/4
The film deserves immediate comparison with the horror genre?s all-time classics.:::1:::4/4
A pleasant sort of deja vu.:::1:::3/4
the only time it shows any crassness is when Reeves pours on the violence and gore instead of cutting away and saving, as Alfredson did so wisely, the best for last.:::1:::3/4
A serious vampire movie that starts the mind thinking and the heart pounding:::1:::7/10
Somber, supernatural spooky - it's an admirable adaptation of the Swedish vampire thriller.:::1:::7/10
If you haven't seen the original, that just means you have two treats in store.:::1:::5/5
The poetic Swedish vampire picture (with arterial spray) Let the Right One In has been hauntingly well transplanted to the high desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico, and renamed Let Me In.:::1:::None
Unnecessary remake that replicates rather than originates, neither truly scary nor even mildly disturbing. Surprisingly poor special effects and the neutering of a big plot point negate any potential.:::0:::2.5/5
Attention Twilight fans. You need to see Let Me In. This is a "real" vampire love story.:::1:::4.5
'Let Me In' is bloody, gory and scary. But it is also smartly written and directed, heartbreakingly acted, and artistically photographed.:::1:::None
Though it's a too-soon remake, Matt Reeves' genre-defying gem is a real grabber, with terrific performances by Chloe Grace Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee.:::1:::B+
You won't find a much bigger fan of the original than yours truly -- and still I was very impressed with Reeves' rendition.:::1:::4/5
Reeves has done the impossible and made a foreign film for a mainstream American audience.:::1:::A
Moody and atmospheric, the film subverts expectations by mixing darkly introspective drama with full-on horror.:::1:::3.5/5
Reeves' direction is a subdued, safe, clean -- and a bit boring.:::0:::3/5
While Reeves gets no points for originality-and you should really see the first movie immediately if you haven't yet-he aptly reproduces the story's emotional core.:::1:::B+
The kids' performances are hugely satisfying -- these are two immensely talented young actors... Definitely a must-see for anyone who loves vampires but hates what Twilight has done to them...:::1:::None
Let Me In is simply riveting, dark and ominous, cruel and unrelenting, sprinkled with bittersweet moments and sentiment.:::1:::3.5/4
The tragedy in Jenkins' pathetic protector focuses the film's themes of desperation and the myopia of puppy love when you're young enough (or undead enough) to feel immortal:::1:::A
In Reeves hands, Let Me In has a calm demeanor and a methodical almost '70s film visual beauty.:::1:::None
Reeves largely sticks close to the look and tone of the first film, but not in the annoying manner of Gus Van Sant's atrocious Psycho remake.:::1:::3/4
Let Me In actually improves on the source material without resorting to the pathetic tics of most American horror films.:::1:::3.5/4
A solid work that may be a needless retread, but one that is respectful and smartly done.:::1:::None
Stylish and effectively creepy, if mostly secondhand.:::1:::None
creepy, eerie and a solid vampire thriller:::1:::3.5/5
Like the original film it maintains an incredible mood of dread and foreboding while also being a strangely touching story about young love.:::1:::4/5
At once tender and brutal, Let Me In is a transfixing elegy the likes of which the supernatural horror genre rarely produces.:::1:::4/5
I simply cannot admire what Reeves does with the remake. The best I can do is commend his skill at imitating the original.:::0:::4/10
Stripping away the mysticism and sexuality of vampire lore, Let Me In has taken everything tantalizing about fanged thrillers and converted it instead into an element of agony:::1:::4/4
Harrowing and heartfelt, this is one of the best films I've seen this year.:::1:::4.5/5
It's a remake that surpasses its predecessor in depth and vision.:::1:::8.5/10
Perhaps the best recommendation one can give Let Me In is that you walk out thinking not about the horror but about the heartbreak.:::1:::3.5/4
an unusually smart, subtle and resonant horror movie, one that will linger long after slasher-film shocks are long forgotten.:::1:::None
Let Me In is not as fantastic as Let the Right One In, which you should rent immediately. But it is undeniably powerful and made with obvious admiration and respect for the source material.:::1:::None
A smart horror film that exploits a deep-seated fear in America: subtitle-phobia.:::1:::3/4
It's still a striking piece of character-driven horror, and it still ranks (despite the effects) among the more understated fright fests to hit the mainstream in recent memory.:::1:::3/4
What works so well here is the juxtaposition of youthful innocence and downright puppy love with monstrosity and murder. Mean kids are scary. Kids who drink blood are scarier.:::1:::B+
It's called Let Me In. That demanding title says something about how the gentle poetry of the original gets lost a bit in Reeves' translation.:::0:::2.5/4
Let Me In both tweaks and fulfills right-wingy, quasi-religious views by making the most virulent embodiment of evil a little girl.:::1:::None
The American version of a beloved Swedish vampire tale comes with an irritating sense of deja vu.:::0:::2.5/5
Not to worry - the redo is neither dumbed-down nor especially softened up.:::1:::None
[Director] Reeves had the smarts to identify and appropriate everything that made the original film so moving and visually memorable. Even better, he invigorates this faithful reproduction with remarkably effective contributions of his own.:::1:::4/5
If subtitle-phobia hinders you from seeing the brilliant, Swedish original, than director Matt Reeves' remarkable American remake is the next best thing.:::1:::85/100
Let Me In is by far one of the best-looking films of the year, genre or no genre. It's a nightmare, sure, but what childhood isn't?:::1:::4/5
Both suitably reverential to the excellent Swedish original and entirely successful as a work of authentic American horror. Smart, scary, and heartbreaking.:::1:::8/10
As good as it is, there is never a time when it transcends the earlier film and strikes out on its own.:::1:::None
... not so much a remake as a reimagining of the material. It's a brilliant film that offers a different, but in no way inferior, take on the story...:::1:::8/10
Every bit as moody, as melancholy and as meaningful as its Swedish inspiration, as it explores heartbreaking themes of alienation and the universal need for human contact.:::1:::3.5/4
Stands firmly on its own two bare feet as not only one of the best horror films of the year but one of the best films, period.:::1:::5/5
I absolutely adored the original Swedish film and was more than worried about a remake. Reeves proved me wrong and delivers one of the best remakes I have ever seen.:::1:::4.5/5
A rare American remake of a foreign horror film that's actually good. (Parental Review also Available):::1:::None
It is at once artful and unpretentious, more interested in intimacy and implication than in easy scares or slick effects.:::1:::4/5
a good looking film...using the snow covered exteriors to convey the frigid cold and Abby's immunity to it.:::1:::B+
Matt Reeves takes a step toward making everyone's favorite bloodsuckers scary again.:::1:::4.5/5
It's a movie driven by commerce, but it does find some moments of inspiration.:::1:::3/4
Certainly well-made on its own, its adherence to almost being a direct copy of the beloved original with a few crucially damaging changes ultimately reveal this to be rather pointless for those already initimately familiar with it.:::0:::2.5/4
Writer/director Matt Reeves wants to make Let Me In a moody, sullen shocker with a touch of romance tossed in, but boring is a better term for it all.:::0:::1.5/4
If you like dank, disturbing little horror movies, invite Let Me In into your moviegoing schedule.:::1:::3.5/4
If you were one of the people who thought an American remake of the 2008 Swedish vampire masterpiece Let the Right One In was a lousy idea, you might want to dial back on the outrage.:::1:::3/4
Reeves so deeply understands the nature of childhood terror that Let Me In burns with a white-hot clarity.:::1:::5/5
It's actually strong enough to make the case that not all remakes bite.:::1:::3/4
Anyone unfamiliar with the Swedish original should find this film to be among the year's better pictures. Those who have seen the earlier movie, however...:::1:::None
The scariest, creepiest and most elegantly filmed horror movie I've seen in years -- it positively drives a stake through the competition.:::1:::3.5/4
Let Me In wants to make your flesh crawl, and it probably will. But it's unlikely to ever get under anyone's skin, the way Let the Right One In did.:::0:::2/4
The camerawork is so integral to the film's success because Owen is experiencing everything for the first time, the sound design is downright Lynchian and his innocence makes it seem like he's not being corrupted, but learning, maturing, and socializing.:::1:::None
a masterpiece of subtle horror told in hushed tones and lurking tension:::1:::5/5
Can something be both great and completely pointless? Because Let Me In is.:::1:::8/10
Bloodless, compared to the Swedish original.:::0:::C+
A rare exception to the rule against American remakes of great foreign-language films, Matt Reeves' terrifying "Let Me In," a remake of a 2008 Swedish film, is perhaps the most accomplished (and goriest) genre film of its kind in ages.:::1:::A-
Altogether more confident and dramatically sound, this is the rare remake that makes a convincing case for existing by exceeding expectations in nearly every way.:::1:::3/4
Far from the bloodlusty teen fantasies of Twilight and True Blood, Let Me In serves as a delicate metaphor for adolescent angst in the Reagan-era 1980s.:::1:::None
...easily one of the best horror films I have ever seen.:::1:::4/4
Let Me In is an smart blend of very rich moments both innocent and extremely dark and twisted.:::1:::8/10
[Reeves] has taken someone else's work and so infused it with apt and knowing choices that if feels as if it began with him personally -- a heck of a thing to achieve with such a potentially dubious project.:::1:::B+
Let Me In is gorgeously shot, with bravura onscreen performances and a gripping narrative. So why does it seem so secondary?:::1:::4/5
Let Me In represents one of the best and most brutal vampire movies to come along in a while...:::1:::3/4
Let Me In is the rare remake that maintains the strengths of the original while staking out new ground.:::1:::A-
This is more than a respectful remake; Let Me In is quietly stylish and thoroughly chilling in its own right.:::1:::None
Movies this bloody are rarely this heady. It's one trend we wouldn't mind seeing catch on.:::1:::3.5/5
...for audiences who have had the pleasure of seeing "Let The Right One In," this version doesn't improve on its source material.:::0:::D
a fatal lack of introspection dooms its hero to be, with full knowledge aforethought, the same psychopathic moron responsible for all this destruction in the first place.:::0:::2/4
American remakes of well regarded foreign films are almost always poor imitations, but director Matt Reeves ("Cloverfield")...has made a film that plays better than the original - for its first half.:::1:::B+
Instead of exploring uncanny realms of psychological terror usually reserved for Poe or Lovecraft, [Reeves] goes all Freddy Krueger.:::0:::2.5/4
The first film had barbed fangs. The more visceral remake has less bite.:::1:::2.5/4
If you've never seen the original, you may not sense that something's missing. And the casting is in some ways an improvement.:::1:::3/4
Despite being about vampires, Let Me In can feel chillingly real.:::1:::3.5/4
It's a heartbreaker of a coming-of-age tale, even if there's a string of exsanguinated corpses to be accounted for.:::1:::3.5/4
To his credit, Reeves preserves much of the original's creepy essence...:::1:::B
I thought for sure that any Hollywood remake of Tomas Alfredson's artful Swedish vampire film, Let the Right One In, would be a crass desecration. Well, color me blushing.:::1:::3/4
It's an honorable attempt, but there's still no genuine need for this film to exist.:::0:::2.5/4
Let Me In may not be its own movie, but it's good just the same.:::1:::4/5
The Americanized version is a nice parlor trick, and will satisfy those who believe fidelity is the principal virtue of a good adaptation, but what's the point?:::1:::B-
The language has been changed to English, of course, which is the only real reason this movie exists; the story development, desolate tone, and key set pieces are mostly copied from the original movie.:::0:::None
Moretz and Smit-McPhee perform in synch with Reeves' stealthy sense of dread... so effectively understated that the tricks he feels obligated to add seem out of place. Yet the movie never seems unnecessary, as remakes of foreign films typically are.:::1:::B+
one of the best films of 2010 -- with or without its celebrated source material.:::1:::4.5/5
So far superior to the usual run of Hollywood horror films that one can easily forgive the fact that it doesn't quite match its Swedish model.:::1:::B
This American remake of 2008's small Swedish gem is a valiant effort but rarely evokes the eerie essence of the original.:::0:::2.5/4
Mercifully free of vampire lore or rules..there's none of the usual romantic blather...when Abby bites a victim, pleasure is the last thing they're thinking about.:::1:::None
Strips away the soul and the vision until it's butchered its source material as badly as the recent Nightmare on Elm Street remake.:::0:::2/5
The original was a very good thriller. The new one is simply a good one.:::1:::3/4
Reeves understands what made the first film so eerie and effective, and here the same things work again.:::1:::3.5/4
Reeves's direction lunges more resolutely for the mainstream jugular, but that's no bad thing.:::1:::4/5
A better adaptation of the Swedish film than we had any reason to expect. Writer/director Matt Reeves kept the original's creepy atmospherics, although he did punch up the action beats.:::1:::3/4
Children should not be exposed to this lurid display of helplessness and pessimism -- and adult viewers should be wary of the nihilistic indulgence.:::0:::None
A striking picture to study, but a blunt, condensed take on the source material, sacrificing an unsettling sense of macabre harmony to keep elements blocky enough so they might be appreciated by a wide, profitable audience.:::0:::C+
Reeves hasn't just remade the Swedish cult vampire film Let the Right One In into a more fluid and visceral movie. He's made it more dangerous.:::1:::B+
Its unique and affecting juxtaposition of tenderness and savagery, combined with a slew of stellar performances, makes for an experience unlike any other in recent horror-movie memory.:::1:::4/5
This is a really good movie, good enough that whether it needed to be made is beside the point. If you've seen the original, you'll be happy with the results. If you haven't, then just sit back and enjoy.:::1:::4/5
Will work better for those who have not seen the original film. ... It's subtle, but far from slow. It's artistic, yet not artsy.:::1:::3/4
Reeves has retained all the uncanny pathos of Alfredson's original, and he's added a layer of domestic angst and despair, as well as overtones of genuine tragedy.:::1:::3.5/4
If I hadn't seen the original, I might have gone ga-ga over Reeves' version. But even with the shock of novelty gone, the film still draws you into its chilly, demonic heart.:::1:::3/4
Let Me In might be so well-liked by English-speaking audiences and Chloe Moretz fans they will seek out the more arty version. Win/win. It can only do good for our favorite genre.:::1:::None
A truly memorable horror classic filled with the same degree of tension and emotion as the Swedish film.:::1:::8/10
The new Let Me In does more than merely preserve the original's mood; it actually improves on it.:::1:::4/5
The gist remains the same, and in some cases improved upon.:::1:::B
Rest assured, much of what made the first film so special remains intact.:::1:::None
There's a human tragedy somewhere here -- but aggrandized puppy-love romance and stylish revenge fantasy is all that lingers.:::0:::None
a successful film for newcomers to the material, but it fails to justify its existence to those familiar with its previous incarnation.:::1:::None
ge Sparks put in the novel left out of the script. But there's real chemistry between the young lovers.:::0:::2/4

a perfect date movie, with a nice blend of romance and light-hearted comedy:::1:::4/5
Not even the ever-likable Seyfried at full-blast sun-kissed luminescence can win the battle against such trite, tired material nor make a viable leading man out of her pretty boy zero of a co-star.:::0:::2/4
... Succeeds on the basis of pure delight, the optimism it emits and an earned happily-ever-after ending.:::1:::B
If you're in the mood for some school-girl daydream fairytale, Letters to Juliet about fits the bill, but even fans of this sort of thing are likely to find themselves short of patience well before the end.:::0:::5/10
Formulaic and telegraphic, there are no surprises in this chaste, passionless movie...:::0:::1.5/5
It's all rather pleasant, but it's also all rather conventional.:::0:::5/10

Letters to Juliet...it's a chick flick thing.:::0:::2/5
The film unravels in a dispiriting morass of cliches and cringy lines.:::0:::2/5
A pair of mediocre leading men sabotage this otherwise charming chick flick.:::0:::2/5
Vanessa Redgrave and the spectacular locales of Tuscany are the main reasons to tolerate the tepid and predictable story...:::0:::C
You can guess the whole film but the picture postcard locations are easy on the eye and the wonderful Redgrave steals the show. Her heartfelt conviction and natural warmth slice through all the schmaltz to make the silly storyline feel real and touching.:::1:::3/5
What kind of twisted fantasy is this?:::0:::2/5
As an antidote to the sugar, what we need now is a grumpy film called Letters to Lady Macbeth, in which malcontents leave rage-filled missives in the battlements of Glamis Castle.:::0:::2/5
Letters From Juliet is far from a great movie. But if you're female or -- like me -- a man with a taste for romance and a fairer deal for our senior citizens, this is one of the year's guiltiest pleasures.:::1:::3/5
It's hard to convey the sheer awfulness. And that's not just me being a grumpy bloke confronted with a chick flick.:::0:::1/5
Seyfried acts like she's spaced out on limoncello in a role even Kate Hudson would have turned down.:::0:::1/5
An unashamedly mushy concoction, Letters To Juliet is the cinematic equivalent of a Barbara Cartland novel, aimed at mainstream romance fans aged anywhere between 13 and 113.:::0:::2.5/5
Redgrave's performance is touching, but generally this romcom is far too schmaltzy.:::1:::3/5
Irked by the endless will they/won't they, girl tells boy: "This is really painful." After close to two hours of fairly unremarkable viewing, at that point the feeling is mutual.:::0:::2/5
The script, sighing, twittering and doing D.H. Lawrence lite, would be rejected as too whimsical by Mills and Boon.:::0:::1/5
This is an all-fudging, all-sludging Cheesepocalypse Now of a movie.:::0:::2/5
Let's just say it's nice to see Redgrave sharing a few scenes with her real-life hubby Franco Nero four decades after their first get-together in 1966's Camelot.:::1:::3/5
Despite a potentially decent premise, this is a disappointing romance, let down by terrible dialogue, poor plotting, severe miscasting, a charisma-free performance from Christopher Egan and a total lack of chemistry between its two leads.:::0:::2/5
Moviegoers don't like surprises in their romantic comedies, and this one plays it particularly safe.:::0:::2.5/4
[T]hose who want something beyond a paint-by-numbers romance/travelogue... will be disappointed.:::0:::2/5
It's impossible to get excited about such cardboard roles from writers Jose Rivera and Tim Sullivan. These two need to write to Juliet ASAP to rediscover their love for writing %u2014 if they ever had it.:::0:::D+

Doubt that the stars are fire, but never doubt that Letters to Juliet is the biggest load of weepie sludge we are likely to see this year. Naturally, I quite enjoyed it.:::1:::None
Seyfried is delightful in this movie whereas I have found her just annoying in others. Maybe it is that she gets to share the screen with Bernal and the luminous Vanessa. Those two could make anybody look good. Still Seyfried is also good in her scenes wi:::1:::2.75/4

Unfortunately, the main couple in the film competes in vain against the scenery.:::0:::2.5/5
Why do I love thee, Juliet? Let me count the ways: there are no decapitations, no car crashes, no gun fights, no pratfalls, no talking animals and no aliens - just one beautiful love story, two captivating romances and lots of picturesque Italian scenery.:::1:::8/10
If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie.:::1:::3.5/5
Let's just say this is the sort of movie where if a character is shown climbing up some shrubbery, you just know a branch will break and send him tumbling earthward.:::0:::2/4
It's a bath in schmaltz from beginning to end but it also has Redgrave who brings instant depth to even the most throwaway of lines.:::1:::None
Seyfried is a real beauty and her star is definitely on the rise after adding this definitive chick flick to her resume. Redgrave is still a classy dame and steals every scene that she appears in...:::1:::2.5/4
[Redgrave's] performance makes the predictable antics of Letters to Juliet worth tolerating.:::1:::None
Endless vistas of the lush Italian countryside, some playful banter, and a likable cast make "Letters to Juliet" worthwhile, even if you feel like you've seen it before. Several times before.:::1:::3/5
Super swoony romantic fluff that's fun for tweens.:::1:::3/5
Seyfried, whose heart frankly doesn't even seem to be in this movie, has no discernible chemistry with either of the men in her life.:::0:::2/5
I want to live in the alternate universe where Vanessa Redgrave's Claire is the lead of Letters to Juliet and the two vapid dorks who trail her on a journey of lost love can learn a lesson or two but never take the spotlight.:::0:::2.5/5
Director Gary Winick and screenwriters Jose Rivera and Tim Sullivan deal in genre cliches, sure, yet they let us view them with fresh eyes.:::1:::3/4
Not to be a cynic or anything, but maybe a fictional 13-year-old isn't the best source of advice for the lovelorn.:::0:::2/4
The light breaking through yonder window is the glare of critical scrutiny - and Letters to Juliet looks pathetic in it.:::0:::1/5
As you might guess, after a great deal of sniping Sophie and Charlie supposedly fall for each other. But the audience never buys it.:::0:::2/4
Screenwriters Jose Rivera and Tim Sullivan have penned some great lines, but also some clunkers, most of which were written for Seyfried and Egan.:::1:::None
"Letters to Juliet" takes an improbable script and turns it into a moving love story, featuring wonderful performances by Vanessa Redgrave and Amanda Seyfried.:::1:::None
Road-tripping romance that features a talented cast and gorgeous locales but an overly sappy plot and nap-inducing pace.:::0:::2/4
Apart from a handful of nicely crafted, brittle exchanges between the two young leads as the antipathy between them transforms into sexual tension, the film is full of shameless Italian stereotypes and poorly executed screwball comedy.:::0:::None
An amusing, touching, reassuringly wholesome romantic travelogue of a film that flies by on its way to the inevitable happy ending.:::1:::B
Love is a commodity in the world of Letters to Juliet, to be processed and marketed as another studio might a G.I. Joe or a Transformer.:::0:::1.5/4
Cinematographer Marco Pontecorvo's sun-drenched palette would be a perfectly sound reason to see this film, but happily it's not the only one.:::1:::4.5/5
Letters to Juliet represents an interesting paradox: it is a movie that is very nearly perfect without being especially good.:::0:::2.5/5
Who can resist such ravishing travel porn?:::1:::4/5
What's so awful about taking a breather? It's enough to bask in the pastoral prettiness and the unexpected harmony of Seyfried and Redgrave.:::1:::3/5
... while [Vanessa] Redgrave can't cut the cliches out of Letters to Juliet entirely, she at least cuts through them occasionally.:::0:::2.5/5
Predictable though the film is, Vanessa Redgrave does nearly mystical work and the film in general has enough humor to make the trip worthwhile.:::1:::2.5/4
As the Taylor Swift song kicks in at the climax and Seyfried has her big romantic moment, you can't help but crane your neck to see what Redgrave is up to in the background.:::0:::2.5/4
If the filmmakers had spent less time on the visual, and more time on appropriate characterizations and a believable script, we might have been as much in love with the film as it seems to be with itself.:::0:::4/10

If you dropped a feather and Letters to Juliet from a tall building simultaneously, which one would hit the ground first? It's lightweight and lazy, an outline for a movie.:::0:::C
Letters to Juliet does poke fun at itself occasionally, but not enough to keep us from saying, "Grazie!" when it finally ends.:::0:::None
Seyfried almost makes up for Dear John as the everygirl heroine who wants to be Julia Roberts for the iPod generation.:::1:::2.5/4
I wish the film was more focused on the love story between Vanessa Redgrave and Franco Nero. Instead, we are made to sit through a foreground love story with zero chemistry.:::0:::2/5
Redgrave brings a lovely gravity to the lightweight proceedings, while Seyfried again proves an unusually levelheaded presence.:::1:::3/4
With all the beautiful settings and attractive people and gorgeously lit vineyards, there is an air of artificiality to Juliet, which is to real-life romance what Cheetos are to a nice piece of aged cheddar. But who doesn't like a Cheeto now and then?:::1:::2.5/4
Sure, you know more or less (ok, more) what's going to happen%u2014let's not pretend this is the sort of story that can ever rise above its genesis%u2014but within this limited range of ambition, Letters to Juliet rises to the top.:::1:::6/10

Redgrave is incandescent, and casting Franco Nero as Lorenzo was inspired.:::1:::2/4
Letters to Juliet is a by-the-numbers romantic comedy -- and I mean that in a good way.:::1:::None
It's almost like the movie is afraid of what it should be -- a young, frisky love story that should be exuberant and carefree, even if it means risking making a fool of itself. What's love, after all, if it doesn't do exactly that?:::0:::C+
There are worse ways to spend a couple of hours. Set in some stunning locales in Italy, Letters is a guilty pleasure that's lighter on the guilt and heavier on the pleasure.:::1:::2.5/4
As the genre goes, this is a superior offering. It gives the first clear evidence that the doe-eyed Seyfried can really act; it soothes the eyes with luscious views of beautiful Tuscany in all its moods...:::1:::3.5/5
In a word, Letters to Juliet is rubbish, but Seyfried and Redgrave make it tolerable in their different ways.:::0:::2/5
From the people who wish they'd brought you THE NOTEBOOK.:::0:::None
A fetching romantic melodrama with a delicious performance by Vanessa Redgrave as an elderly woman on a quest for love.:::1:::3/5
What's important is that it avoids the unfunny jokiness and juvenile tendencies that define too many romantic comedies while also sidestepping the mawkishness of the Nicolas Sparks-inspired dramas.:::1:::3/4
I'd take any woman in my life, ages 10 to 100, to Letters to Juliet and my guess is we'd both leave with a little Italian glow.:::1:::None
Letters to Juliet offers little to viewers besides many trite truisms about the ways of the heart, some sumptuous views of the Tuscan countryside and a lovely performance by Redgrave.:::0:::2/4
Ms. Redgrave gives the film, which was directed by Gary Winick, a heart and a buoyant spirit. Seeing her in action is like sitting in on a master acting class.:::1:::None
A sugary paean to quixotic cliches and a film destined to be a guilty pleasure for some (me included, sigh) and the painful price of a relationship for others (so steel yourselves).:::1:::3/5
This one burns going down, like cheap Chianti.:::0:::1/4
Seyfried has worked opposite some of the greatest actors in filmdom in recent years, including Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore. That she again holds her own, this time with Redgrave, is a measure of her talent.:::1:::2.5/4
It's no "Under the Tuscan Sun," but it's a far better sit than "When in Rome.":::0:::C+
A blithely frivolous movie that glows with as much starry-eyed cliche and scenic splendor as it shudders with illogic and lack of common sense.:::0:::2/4
Redgrave! Slim and silvery as lightning, she is always a revelation. She accelerates the movie by slowing down to silent stillness in order fully to hear -- and carefully digest -- what others do and say.:::1:::3/4
A purported comedy that had me mentally following minor characters off screen, wondering if their lives might be more interesting than what was happening on it.:::0:::C
It's harmless and pretty and utterly predictable, but kind of a waste of time for anyone who's ever seen, well, any other romantic comedy set in a beautiful location.:::0:::2/5
Where the movie fails completely is the most important, meat-and-potatoes parts. Namely, the main characters and a compelling, believable story line. These are both lacking.:::0:::2/4
You don't have to be 13 and a tapioca-brained romantic to enjoy Letters to Juliet. But it would help.:::0:::1.5/4
If well done, a film like Letters To Juliet should need no surprises. But it does need more than the postcard-ready vistas against which director Gary Winick frames much of the action.:::0:::C
Letters to Juliet is a guilty pleasure for the ladies, perfect Blu-ray fodder when their significant others turn them into World of Warcraft widows for the evening.:::1:::3/5
The feel-good Seyfried movie of the year -- though that's not such a hard feat when your two other yearly releases include a Nicholas Sparks weepie and a twisted Atom Egoyan psycho-thriller.:::0:::2.5/5

What light through yonder window breaks? 'Tis the fiery wrath of William Shakespeare, dragged back to this mortal coil to lend his cred to a dreadful chick flick.:::0:::2/4

All [the movie] proves is that if you're going to make a road movie rom-com, you should invite Vanessa Redgrave to tag along on the journey...Her grace and charm overshadow all else in it.:::0:::C
The key to the film's success is its lack of strain. As written by Jose Rivera and Tim Sullivan, this isn't one of those pushy slapstick affairs; it's more romantic than comic, and despite the corn there are no villains.:::1:::3/4
Eye candy abounds, but it'd be easier to enjoy that sun-drenched scenery if director Gary Winick weren't so hell-bent on cramming cliches down our throats that include square-jawed hunks riding in on white horses and scaling balconies.:::0:::1.5/4

The good news is that Letters to Juliet is only the third-worst romantic comedy set in Europe released this year.:::0:::2/5
While not a messy film, Juliet is persistently hollow, diving into a dopey rom-com conclusion (with cutesy Shakespearean overtones) that merely confirms the insipid direction at hand.:::0:::C-

There are a few moments where the romance is overdone, and the film verges on being too sentimental, but those scenes are saved by the sweet performances of its cast.:::1:::None
There's nothing wrong with a squishy, sentimental romantic confection now and then. But Letters to Juliet is a mere lollipop. It's gone before its 101-minute running time expires, and you're left with the stick.:::0:::None
Letters To Juliet is a gentle, charming story that features a winning lead performance from Amanda Seyfried.:::1:::None
Gary Winick's flat direction does the material no favors: If Egan and Seyfried have any chemistry, it's framed out of their awkwardly staged climactic kisses.:::0:::None
Doesn't have a lick of cynicism -- it's as pure of heart as they come. A fine ideal, but it feels as flat as a pizza.:::0:::C
Well and truly geared to a female audience who are likely to savour the fanciful plot and neatly wrapped feel-good denouement.:::0:::2/5
As a romantic tale, the movie is bland and predictable and the only reasons to see it are the luminous appearance of Vanessa Redgrave in a supporting role and the picaresque beauty of its setting, Verona.:::0:::C

For the first time in a very long while, Bening disappears into a character and turns in a performance that isn't about her shamelessly playing to the rafters to grab after Oscar.:::1:::3.5/4
Bening and Watts are good enough to see it through, and it's good to see Jackson actually play his age for once.:::1:::3/5
It's a highly contrived affair with a barely concealed, deeply conservative Catholic agenda, and it has the ring of a cracked bell calling the righteous to prayer.:::0:::None
Mother and Child reminds us how important the notion of lineage - of finding a discernible path through life that doesn't just begin and end with ourselves - is to our personal identity, and the decisions we make in life.:::1:::3.5/5

Bening, consistently one of the best US screen actresses, is really the main reason to keep you watching.:::1:::3/5

The producer is Alejandro Gonzalez Inarittu, who has directed other karmic-coincidence dramas. This one looks mannered and gimmicky.:::0:::2/5
Garcia may have a good movie in him; Inarritu may have another (he once made Amores Perros). But as collaborators they should be divorced and sent, like their characters, to far-flung corners of the creative planet.:::0:::2/5

What's spot-on is the performances of the three lead actresses, Annette Bening, Naomi Watts and Kerry Washington.:::1:::B-
This movie packs an emotional wallop and women will get the most out of the way difficult decisions are reached in life-changing situations. Bening gives her best performance in years and makes a remarkable transformation that deserves Oscar consideration:::1:::3/4
For the most part, Garcia offers a sober, clear-eyed picture that's populated with prickly personalities and unenviable situations, and he and his actors are brave enough not to flinch even during the most challenging interludes.:::1:::3/4
Garcia keeps his various stories flowing and in perfect balance.:::1:::3.5/4
Does as much disservice to its stars as it does to the art of graceful cinematic storytelling.:::0:::1/5
As far as the stories are concerned, a couple of them are pretty good. But the nearly disastrous third section unravels the entire movie.:::0:::None
A gently lathered soap opera whose bubbles burst nonetheless with expected timing and unwelcome force.:::0:::None
The emotional breadth of these performances makes the flow chart predictability tolerable.:::1:::B
This is a movie well worth your time and attention.:::1:::4.5/5
These people are not easy to love, but they are fascinating to watch.:::1:::3.5/5
This isn't one of those lo-fi indie movies that sells out in the third act for a big bang. By the end, it's what's resolved as much as what's not resolved that makes this story worth telling.:::1:::None
Mother and Child winds up with some very mixed messages.:::0:::2/5
Naomi Watts and Annette Benning give outstanding performances in this increasingly contrived and sentimental tale of mothers and daughters, and the joys and anguish that come with adoption.:::1:::3/5
A beautifully nuanced script, Bening at her best, and superb against-type performances by Watts and Jackson, make this a must-see film for, and about, women -- especially mothers.:::1:::4/5
Mother and Child -- which interestingly never makes an issue of race in its relationships -- is rewarding viewing, even if it's not exactly feel-good entertainment.:::1:::4/5
A powerful parable that uses the most primal of bonds to uncover the aching abyss of regret and the fundamental human need for connection.:::1:::None
There's something vaguely mystical -- and quite affecting -- about the way the individual paths of these women come together in Mother and Child. Intentionally or not, the movie is about the invisible hand of fate, or a higher plan, in our lives.:::1:::None
With an emotionally raw script and top-notch performances, this provides an insightful look into the complex bond between mother and child.:::1:::None
Like mother, like daughter: Ice queens and overachievers:::1:::C
The characters and the cast should deliver in spades, but the story falters, makes a couple of clumsy jumps and twists into contorted tangles with subplots that are mere distractions:::1:::None
Mother and Child takes us beyond our comfort zone as emotional boundaries are stretched and canvassed. It is an intriguing film, but there are flaws:::1:::None
Obviously, this is emotionally rich ground and Garcia plows it perhaps a bit too heavily.:::1:::B
If Garcia's film never quite catches up with his ambitions for it, well, at least he's trying.:::1:::3.5/5
Mother and Child's best moments come from its many small and wonderful character details.:::1:::3/4
A thoughtful and provocative film about the way we live now.:::1:::3/4
[Garcia] lets the picture start to go soft in the middle, and teary melodrama floods in like water from a broken dam.:::0:::2/4
You'll wonder if the message of the movie is that the process of adoption turns women into vicious hags. But that can't be right, can it?:::0:::None
This is well worth seeing for Bening's arresting, unpleasant performance.:::1:::None
You haven't seen women like this before. Cruel, distant, unfriendly, and selfish. Provocative and daring in its unsentimental approach to real life problems.:::1:::None
You'll laugh and you'll cry at what turns out to be Rodrigo Garcia's finest work to date.:::1:::None
Does the excellence of the second part make up for the rancid, unintentionally campy opening? Not for me, though perhaps others would be more forgiving.:::0:::6/10
Great dramatic acting by the three lead women, and it's fantastic to see Samuel L. Jackson back in a strong supporting role.:::1:::7/10
The story sometimes stretches credulity, but the talented cast brings out the drama.:::1:::3/5
Mother and Child has what might be the first Oscar caliber performance of the year.:::1:::2.5/4
So many stories come packaged in hyped genres that we can forget how much character can hold sway. Watts, Bening and Washington -- along with a fine ensemble and a humane director -- make sure we remember.:::1:::3.5/4
When Jimmy Smits holds out his hand, suddenly Karen's lifelong fury evaporates, transforming her into the loveliest woman ever known to man. What? All this time, and all she needed was the touch of Smits' mitts?:::0:::3/10
With Mother and Child, Garca brings his finely calibrated sense of drama to the subject of adoption, which he handles with characteristic restraint and insight -- at least until the film's maudlin, too-pat finale.:::0:::2/4
Something like a finely-written and -acted soap opera.:::1:::B
Though really nothing more than a high-toned soap opera,...the extraordinary performances elevate the material far above its treacle-drenched roots.:::1:::B
This is an actors' showcase first, and clearly Garcia enjoys demonstrating what this ensemble can do.:::1:::3/4
The film reminds us that character, not plot, is what binds us to a story. Cutting between scenes of each in her unique environment, the movie tantalizes us.:::1:::2.5/4
The fine actors show how we bond to those not related to us by blood -- and also how we love. Bring Kleenex.:::1:::3/4
The movie's substance lies in its psychological profiles, and it's as twisty and tortuous as any peek into the subconscious is liable to be.:::1:::B
It's not an easy film of righteousness, but a trembling drama, with more venom than anticipated, salvaged by a few outstanding performances.:::1:::B-
A screenwriter's butterfly flaps its wings and a chain of events is set into motion, resulting in the latest cinematic ensemble tale of connectivity and yearning. This one's good, though.:::1:::3/4
Of all the performances, Samuel L. Jackson's is the most surprising. It sometimes appears that the busy Jackson will take almost any role to stay working. This film provides a reminder of his subtlety.:::1:::3.5/4
...intelligent and aimed at a mature femme audience. In the end, it is all about closure.:::1:::B-
Dynamite performances from Annette Bening and Naomi Watts ignite this strong drama from writer-director Rodrigo Garcia.:::1:::3/4
Writer/director Rodrigo Garcia is the son of famed Colombian novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez, so maybe the filmmaker comes by all the magic and coincidence in his stories naturally.:::1:::3.5/5
If you are a regular moviegoer who can't get enough of the daytime soaps, look no further than Mother and Child. It has enough soapy story lines to fill out at least three daytime series for a month.:::0:::C
It's tough for actors to be nuanced when the movie isn't, and these intriguingly jagged edges soon get smoothed out.:::0:::2/4
In the feature-length soap opera "Mother and Child," writer-director Rodrigo Garcia creates a multiple narrative about women, the choices - sometimes forced upon them - that they make regarding childbirth and the manifold repercussions.:::0:::B-
Mother and Child keeps the traffic moving smoothly, much more so than a movie like Crash, because Garcia writes characters rather than positions, and he knows that the silences between people usually speak louder than their words.:::1:::2.5/4
Though Watts's Elizabeth brings a sense of darkness and unpredictability to the film, the hyperbolic flourishes and the melodramatic climax offset the actresses' best efforts.:::0:::2.5/4
This movie's calm, steady control keeps a wide variety of good actors in the same universe.:::1:::None
Tender, heartfelt and intriguingly structured albeit occasionally melodramatic. Annette Bening, Kerry Washington and Naomi Watts shine in their captivating, raw and brave performances.:::1:::8.21/10
You may not quite trust Mother and Child -- its soft spots and fuzzy edges give it away -- but you can believe just about everyone in it.:::1:::3.5/5
Adoption drama probes complex anger, heartbreak, hope.:::1:::4/5
Still, stellar actresses Annette Bening and Naomi Watts rise above every impediment, delivering memorably luminous moments as mother and child, separated at birth.:::1:::3/5
The film is an actors' showcase that Bening makes the most of.:::1:::3/4
Garcia has achieved a scale and empathy that far surpasses his previous machinations without sacrificing the nuanced platforms he has granted actors all along.:::1:::None
Significant credit goes to these committed actors, who are forced to give speeches and make choices regularly at odds with authentic human behavior.:::1:::3.5/5
The leads have excellent support from Jimmy Smits, Cherry Jones, Shareeka Epps and S. Epatha Merkerson-plus, that most welcome rarity, a subtle turn from Samuel L. Jackson.:::1:::4/5
Rodrigo Garcia knew he was making a good movie, but did he really understand the kind of good movie he was making?:::1:::3/4
That Garcia manages to spin three rich and complex yarns without ever losing hold of the main thread -- the deep and mysterious connections between mothers and daughters -- is evidence of a keen eye and an exceptionally curious mind.:::1:::3.5/4
Writer/director Rodrigo Garcia has fashioned a clear-eyed look at motherhood at all stages.:::1:::3/4
It's a case of three exceptional actresses -- Annette Bening, Naomi Watts and Kerry Washington -- constituting an ensemble of obviousness.:::0:::None
The best thing about "Mother and Child" is Annette Bening's perceptive performance.:::1:::B
It would feel overly theatrical if Watts, Bening, and Washington didn't convey the vulnerability beneath every firm demurral, lacerating insult, and refusal to engage.:::1:::B
An extraordinary film about adoption and the lives of three very different women on separate quests for love, nurturing, and personal fulfillment.:::1:::5/5
The tremendous cast is reason enough to give it a chance. Bening, Watts and Washington are at their very best.:::1:::3.5/5
thick, saccharine pablum:::0:::2/5
Poses a number of intriguing questions about the nature of maternity, only to obscure them with a gloss that is equal parts sentiment and subtle but specious politics.:::1:::7/10
Woe, by the way, unto the good, decent men who cross these women's paths. In the ovarian jungle of Mother and Child, each gent is undervalued in his own way.:::0:::C+
When a filmmaker does everything right, as in Rodrigo Garcia's Mother and Child, you may be watching a masterpiece.:::1:::None
Rodrigo Garcia's reputation as a writer for and director of women will increase exponentially with Mother and Child, an insightfully observed and exceptionally acted ensemble piece precisely about what the title suggests.:::1:::None
Three story threads finally intersect in a revelatory examination of what motherhood means.:::1:::None
A believably unbalanced Bening scores the movie's true coup: Karen's revitalizing relationship with a sweetly persistent coworker (Jimmy Smits) is a rare example of Hollywood doing right by midlife romance.:::1:::3/5
One of the many pleasures in this exemplary film is watching the women grow and evolve, revealing more about themselves in each successive scene. Fraught with pitfalls, the narrative comes together seamlessly.:::1:::None
The combination of strong writing and note-perfect performances makes Mother and Child one of those unforgettable films that should be amongst the year's best.:::1:::9/10
Like a math equation whose inevitability doesn't diminish its crisp clarity of truth...It unwraps its surprises in ways that pay off as the movie goes on.:::1:::None
Mother and Child is suffused with grief and loss. It's also suffused with compassion and insight.:::1:::None
A two-hankie weepie for the family-values set, Rodrigo Garcia's latest sudser worships at the altar of motherhood, a state that the writer-director posits as something la Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers episode has more logic and reality to it:::0:::1/5
An on-the-nose though cathartically emotional melodrama giving Mira Sorvino her most substantial bigscreen role in years and featuring a head-turning performance by Barry Pepper.:::1:::None
Moving adoption drama tackles alcoholism, family violence.:::1:::3/5
This "family" film fails to deliver much more than good intentions and predictable conflict.:::0:::2/4
Like Dandelion Dust is a well-acted, earnest film about adoptive parents' worst nightmare, dealing sympathetically with all parties in a lose-lose situation.:::1:::3/5
An earnest and well-acted, if occasionally flat, drama about what it means to be a parent.:::0:::2/4
Barry Pepper gives an award worthy performance in this film about an adoptive parent's worst nightmare:::1:::7/10
Riveting, powerful and genuinely heartfelt. Mira Sorvino deserves an Oscar for her raw, brave and captivating performance.:::1:::9.0/10
Like Dandelion Dust is the type of sobering family drama that could have turned out sappy and cliched. It didn't.:::1:::B+
Like Dandelion Dust explores, in a captivating and powerful way, the truth that love's ultimate expression is sacrifice.:::1:::3/4
Familiar adoption drama is enhanced by complex characters and credible situations.:::1:::None
For those who like this genre of film, this one executes the formula very well.:::1:::3/5
A character-driven adoption drama blessed by compelling performances by a talented ensemble topped by Barry Pepper and Mira Sorvino.:::1:::3.5/4
Like Dandelion Dust is a movie that pulls you in and holds you, anchored by strong performances and a recognition that to love a child is to love oneself.:::1:::3.5/4
A well-acted drama with a compelling plot: You'll definitely want to see what happens at the end.:::1:::3/4
Despite some on-the-nose dialogue and a needless revelatory flourish toward the end, Hamilton gets at the strangeness of lived American history, in which violent ruptures leave behind poorly understood scars.:::1:::None
...Night Catches Us has a lived-in, almost languid feel, with artistic cinematography by David Tumblety capturing moments that are as perfectly framed as still photographs.:::1:::7/10
February 1, 2011 Writer-director Tanya Hamilton and two of today's most gifted actors have produced a sensitive drama with a powerful conclusion.:::1:::B+
Tanya Hamilton's Night Catches Us, a snapshot of the post-Black Power movement era, suffers most from its structural deficiencies.:::1:::54/100
Writer-director Tanya Hamilton has crafted an intriguing narrative even if she struggles to realize it onscreen.:::1:::3/5
Tanya Hamilton directed her own script, and though her ending leaves loose ends dangling, the movie is refreshing for its seriousness and originality.:::1:::None
Attempts to pry the lid off a painful chapter of American history that textbook writers and elected officials would rather erase or whitewash.:::1:::3/5
This is just another reminder there is a whole pool of acting talent in America, almost a whole film industry, that white audiences are largely unaware of.:::1:::B
The real story here is the arrival of (director Tanya) Hamilton.:::1:::2.5/4
Washington and Mackie both deliver deeply-felt performances in roles that are all about nuance, particularly when the text sometimes fails them.:::1:::6.8/10
Except for a stellar soundtrack by the Roots, there isn't much here to make anyone overly excited.:::0:::2.5/4
works in maddening shades of gray and pure, compelling lyricism to tell a tragic story about events that are neither right nor wrong, but somewhere in between:::1:::5/5
An excellent achievement for its ability to weave so many complex themes and shades of gray with such poise.:::1:::3.5/4
Anthony Mackie and Kerry Washington nearly rescue the piece but it just doesn't come together into anything memorable enough to recommend.:::0:::None
As a director, Hamilton makes Liv Ullmann look like an action movie director - and just for the record, Ullmann makes Ingmar Bergman look like Jerry Bruckheimer.:::0:::1/4
Its rhythm forces audiences to pay attention to what its superb actors express non-verbally, and to measure the weight of the characters' past lives.:::1:::3/4
The film leads to no showy conclusion, no spectacular climax. It is about movement possible within the soul even in difficult times.:::1:::3/4
Sometimes [the film] wisely demonstrates that even in a volatile time and place, there's a time and place to take action. Other times it feels like a shorthand lesson for kids.:::1:::3/5
A poorly-paced, bland and underwhelming drama that can't be saved by its authentic production values nor by Washington and Mackie's strong performances.:::0:::5.21/10
The movie evokes its time and place so potently that it almost doesn't matter that Hamilton's script proves unequal to her vision.:::1:::None
Night Catches Us, a politically sophisticated and ethically serious film, makes no big speeches or obvious points.:::1:::3.5/5
Through its two leads, Kerry Washington and Anthony Mackie, "Night Catches Us' is a provocative and powerful drama that moves with solid acting from the ensemble cast.:::1:::3/4
...drab, pause-laden, and indecisive:::0:::3/10
It raises tangled questions about whether it is better to live humiliated or arm yourself, yet for the most part it's dramatically inert, talky and directionless, and it ends quietly without saying much of anything.:::0:::1.5/4
Hamilton will no doubt make more polished movies, but this one has unusual atmosphere and emotional depth, and tackles subject matter no mainstream American film would touch without Hazmat equipment.:::1:::None
Mackie and Washington are too fine to let stock situations overtake them.:::1:::B
Merits admiration as an ambitious debut feature, though the impact of its splendid cast is blunted by the awkward structure of its screenplay.:::1:::None
Tendinike the essence of womanhood.:::0:::.5/4
Not a single false note in this story of women's vulnerabilities, loneliness, seeking, disappointments, all brought about by the adoption conventions.:::1:::A-
Dealing with adoption from differnet perspectives, Gracia's film is timely, well acted tale that unfortunately gets too conventional and schematic as it goes along, explaining each and every detail; even so, Naomi Watts and Annette Bening are splendid.:::1:::B-
An obvious return to form for filmmaker Rodrigo Garcia...:::1:::3/4
A slick, ensemble melodrama that appears to touch on every female issue regarding motherhood, family and relationships.:::1:::3/5
:::0:::C
:::1:::3.5/5
:::1:::3/4
:::0:::None
It may be cliched and unoriginal, but it accomplished something that most other movies in the genre failed to do: It made me, and a theater full of people, laugh quite a bit.:::1:::3/4
Too many scenes are forced and seem out of place.:::0:::1.5/5
Good intentions and a good cast do not necessarily a good film make.:::0:::1.5/4
Except for Mencia, who should never be allowed near a camera again, Our Family Wedding isn't particularly awful, but that's about the best that can be said about it.:::0:::5/10
This inexplicable Hollywood movie contains a shocking collection of racial stereotypes...:::0:::None
Lacks a single legitimate laugh, despite engineering the humping of Forest Whitaker's leg by a priapic goat. Don't ask.:::0:::1/4
My Big Fat Rubbish Wedding.:::0:::1.5/5
A goat eats Forest Whitaker's Viagra. Do you really want me to tell you what happens?:::0:::2/5
This leaden romantic comedy feels like a pilot for a television series that never made the grade.:::0:::1/5
Too much lowest common denominator thinking sabotages any merits this might have had.:::0:::2/5
Do you recall a racial culture-clash comedy from 1967 called Guess Who's Coming To Dinner? This is an appalling, crass, 21st-century rehash of the same idea.:::0:::None
Lance's family are black. America's family are Mexican. And hilarity ensues! Supposedly.:::0:::2/5
Over four decades have passed since the ground-breaking Guess Who's Coming To Dinner first crossed the interracial romantic divide. But while this update intends solely to amuse, its sense of humour is as weak as the supposedly happy couple at its core.:::0:::2/5
A tedious and unnecessary rehash of many better films, this serves only to cast further doubt on the credentials of Oscar winner Forest Whitaker and the big screen career of America Ferrera.:::0:::2/5
An idea that might have worked as a sit-com but comes off lackluster in the format of a feature film, 'Our Family Wedding' is as predictable as can be.:::0:::1.5/4
When a biracial couple (America Ferrera and Lance Gross) tell their families about their engagement, everything goes awry in this formulaic flick. One particular low point: A goat at the wedding reception swallows Viagra and runs amok. Ha ha ha!:::0:::2/4
Like a lobotomized Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? -- with a horny goat thrown in.:::0:::.5/5
so lacking in anything remotely fresh, humorous, interesting, or entertaining that you have to invent reasons for its existence:::0:::1/5
Yikes.:::0:::1/4
This film is not as funny as the Bernie Mac film,'Guess Who?,' as it's long in the tooth, and very predictable from start to finish.:::0:::1/4
The cast of this film deserves a better movie but then so does the audience.:::0:::3/10
I didn't buy a word of this thing and I didn't laugh enough.:::0:::None
Alternately flat and overwrought.:::0:::None
One act into Our Family Wedding and the two soon-to-be-marrieds start thinking eloping is a better idea. They should have.:::0:::2/5
It's not toppling Father of the Bride for status in the canon of wedding movies but for a film that gently negotiates the tensions of family and race, it's not too bad.:::1:::2.5/5
I just saved you a lot of aggravation. You owe me.:::0:::.5/4
You'll wish Lucia and Marcus had eloped and taken you with them.:::0:::1.5/4
Conventional wedding comedy is an 'I do' for families.:::0:::2/5
Only the cast -- led by Whitaker and Mencia as they begrudgingly bond between squabbling sessions -- makes it bearable.:::0:::2/5
Here's all you need to know about Our Family Wedding: It thinks that feeding a goat an entire bottle of Viagra is the height of hilarity.:::0:::1.5/4
To anyone who has ever sparked up a TV set, let alone entered a movie theatre, all this is perfectly evident in the first five minutes.:::0:::1/4
Alternately rancid and ridiculous, strident and sickly sweet, Our Family Wedding offers plenty that's old, borrowed and blue; it's the something new that's missing.:::0:::1/5
Although I had a giddy good time watching the movie, I'm pretty sure I hated it; but I so enjoyed hating it that I pretty much loved it. The bottom line is laughter doesn't lie.:::1:::3/4
[A] slick, slapsticky, forgettable comedy, a cool-jazz riff on upper-middle-class American families sorting through misconceptions.:::1:::3/4
Our Family Wedding plays out like an elongated Disney TV episode, going precisely where you expect every inch of the way.:::0:::D+
A modest culture-clash ensemble comedy that distinguishes itself from the formula pack by treating its characters with respect.:::1:::3/4
Despite being as predictable and derivative as a wedding singer's playlist, there's just enough sweetness, and just enough smiles, to keep it from falling flat.:::0:::2/4
Blacks and Latinos finally star together in a major movie as wretched as anything whites have done:::0:::F
Misguided and embarrassing for all those involved; could have easily been a segment in the atrocious Valentine's Day:::0:::4/10
The only bouquet anyone's going to catch from this contrivance has the aroma of stale comedy.:::0:::1.5/4
Sweetly amiable yet hackneyed, filled with contrived coincidence and cliche-laden bickering.:::0:::5/10
A cringeworthy, unfunny example of a culture-clash romantic comedy.:::0:::1/4
Rick Famuyiwa's movie repeatedly trips and falls on its way up the aisle.:::0:::1.5/4
Ferrera and Gross are the most appealing pair I've seen in awhile; their calm confidence is a welcome antidote to the unrealistic couples who've been cluttering our screens way too long.:::1:::3/5
Instead of invitations, they should be sending out apologies for Our Family Wedding, a cake-and-kisses comedy that has disaster written all over it and not for the right reasons.:::0:::1/5
Ferrara, as the would-be bride, and King, as her sensible in-law, brighten the movie every time they appear. Whitaker and Mencia are also appealing, as is Diana Maria-Riva as Ferrara's mom.:::1:::2.5/4
It's a testament to the cast that the entire enterprise is more entertaining than it has a right to be.:::1:::2.5/4
The likable cast keep things watchable, particularly handsome Gross, who is surely destined for bigger things, and Ferrera, who's still as sweetly unaffected on-screen as she was back in Real Women Have Curves.:::1:::2.5/4
This mixed-race page from the Meet the Parents book is a tasteless exercise in familiarity and contempt.:::0:::2/4
Wait till the DVD release.:::0:::2/4
These performers all deserve better, funnier material than this lame, occasionally offensive, multicultural comedy-drama can offer.:::0:::1/4
Our Family Wedding is another Hollywood fast-food sandwich. But instead of two squirts of ketchup someone actually took the time to lay some fresh tomato on that greasy bun.:::1:::2.5/4
These are all supposed to be believable characters, but none of them are.:::0:::D+
There's something very troubling underneath.:::0:::1.5/4
Parental Content Review:::0:::None
As wilted as last weekend's bridesmaid bouquet, "Our Family Wedding" manages to be offensive to African-Americans, Latinos, women, men, and sentient life forms of any kind.:::0:::D
A rancid ode to the quainter, simpler times before integration and that pesky Civil Rights Movement got in the way.:::0:::0/4
Finally! A movie than combines all the gender bashing of terrible TV commercials and awful sitcoms... with the repulsive wedding porn of every other romantic comedy of recent years.:::0:::None
A crude culture clash sitcom in which both groups lose--along with those of us who belong to neither.:::0:::D
The actual dramatic conflict -- two families united through marriage -- is colorblind. That approach might seem evolved, if the screenplay wasn't so stupid.:::0:::2/5
Writer/director Rick Famuyiwa's version of interracial marriage is about as much fun as a trip to the dentist.:::0:::C
Most comedies would be content to mine the comic possibilities of Viagra only once, especially if they're going to devote considerable screen time to the dramatic acting of Carlos Mencia.:::0:::D-
At the heart of the story, of course, is the always delightful Ferrera as the bride-to-be caught upsetting either the man she loves or the family she also loves.:::1:::3/5
Any time you're making g towards lyricism rather than urgency, the director strikes a tone that is both melancholic and ultimately hopeful:::1:::4/5
It's either a testament to David Tumblety's cinematography or a knock to Philly that the city looks gray and gritty, perfect for the '70s milieu of locally-based writer-director Tanya Hamilton's film.:::1:::B+
Night Catches Us, Tanya Hamilton's first feature as a director, is something to cherish.:::1:::3/4
Hamilton drifts dangerously close to formula, and risks reducing her genuinely fascinating subject to a backdrop. But Mackie and Washington are too fine to let stock situations overtake them.:::1:::B
Most successful are the scenes involving Marcus and Iris, a 10-year-old girl who grew up fatherless and watchful of her tumultuous surroundings.:::1:::7/10
...a small film, one that could as easily play on the tube as the big screen, that marks a solid debut for Hamilton. If only she'd brought the history so integral to her characters into sharper focus.:::1:::B-
[Anthony] Mackie and [Kerry] Washington -- two of the best young actors working today -- are exceptional, especially when they get a chance to share the screen.:::1:::3.5/5
Here is an honorable attempt to address a complex chapter of African-American pride, one that's usually hidden under hairdos and wah-wah pedals.:::1:::3/5
Writer-director Tanya Hamilton's striking debut is the rare recent American-independent film that goes beyond the private dramas of its protagonists, imagining them as players in broader historical moments.:::1:::None
A Prodigal Panther pays the price to make peace with a turbulent past.:::1:::3.5/4
"Night Catches Us" never catches up with the past that it only keeps in its rearview perspective.:::0:::C-
A gritty urban race relation pic set in the simmering summer streets of Philadelphia.:::1:::B+
The movie's real power is in the way it connects its characters to not just their environment and their past but to everyone's past, the historical past -- the historical record.:::1:::3/4
A bittersweet and well-acted drama set in 1976 about two African-Americans in Philadelphia forced to come to terms with the ghosts of their past.:::1:::4/5
...a complex, intriguing film written and directed by Tanya Hamilton and set in Philadelphia's African American community in the summer of 1976.:::1:::7/10
Making a remarkable feature debut, Hamilton distinguishes herself more as a filmmaker than as a screenwriter.:::1:::3/4
This might be Tanya Hamilton's debut film, but this was not a movie for amateurs. She clearly took her time and did research. A Columbia University grad, she made a movie that is leagues ahead of that of a typical first-time filmmaker.:::1:::B
Acting, particularly by Anthony Mackie and Kerry Washington, is first-rate, but the story is as ramshackle as a South Philly tenement, with an equal number of structural violations.:::0:::None
The film is compelling as it dramatizes the confusing and contradictory impulses in the black community during that time.:::1:::None
Despite a heartfelt approach and some capable performances, Night Catches Us is a collection of thoughtful ideas in search of a screenplay.:::0:::None
The star power of natural movie stars Anthony Mackie and Kerry Washington lights up and keeps afloat Tanya Hamilton's Night Catches Us:::1:::2.5/4

Paranormal Activity 2 is surprisingly boring, not scary and lazily made. This is hands down one of the worst horror movies that I've ever seen.:::0:::2/10
It's the scariest movie in years.:::1:::4.5/5
To put it simply, if you've seen the first film, then you've seen this film. There's nothing new offered here, so there's not much of a point in bothering with it.:::0:::2/4
While the meagre rationing of shocks is undoubtedly frustrating for the bulk of the movie, this allows the final act plenty of room to crank the fear factor up to 11.:::1:::3/5
The good ol' child-in-peril gimmick is the only new thing offered by Tod Williams' follow-up to Oren Peli's 2007 hit.:::0:::C
Instead of being trapped in one bedroom, this family has quite a few escape routes that they use quite a bit, which doesn't really help build a sense of dread. It just makes you think, "Get out of the house, fools. The door's right there.":::0:::2/5
The scares in Paranormal Activity 2 aren't as frequent or always as well built as the original film's, but those that exist are still pretty effective.:::1:::B-
Not only drags out too long, it fails to pay off at the end.:::0:::5/10
[A] title card end[s] the film on another ominous ellipsis, ominous primarily because it guarantees the need for a third film, most likely to be released in 3D, it is assumed.:::0:::2.5/5
For me, the meager payoff wasn't worth the effort in time and patience. The bother wasn't worth the wait.:::0:::5/10
I enjoyed Paranormal Activity 2 and I'd recommend it even if you weren't a fan of the first.:::1:::None
I anxiously await the third leg in the series.:::1:::None
Like Oren Peli, who created the first film, director Tod Williams keeps the dialogue So-Cal dumb and colorless, which must be part of the scare plan but makes both these movies hard to sit through.:::0:::None
Revealing more of the mystery reduces the scare factor but ups the intrigue.:::1:::3.0/4.0
PA2 actually isn't that frightening, but it complicates the questions of documentation, memory, and history in ways that make any possible answers at least a little unnerving.:::1:::None

It isn't as tense as the first film, and sometimes you do wish it was as simple as its predecessor. But it's certainly a must-see horror sequel.:::1:::3.5/5
Effectively creepy, but it leads nowhere...:::0:::2.5/4
It's very effective and intense, creating tension with small things like an open door or a spinning mobile over a child's crib.:::1:::3/5
The inevitable sequel to Oren Peli's $15,000 sleeper is actually a prequel, and it's a sharp little piece of genre filmmaking.:::1:::None
...reaffirms familiar scare tactics...taps into a certain kind of eeriness implicit in the threat to suburban domesticity, which was precisely what made "Poltergeist" so frightening back in the day.:::1:::None
A few new elements and perspectives are quickly ground down by the repetitive structure, which we got sick of during the first Activity. Terror and chills deplete as this samey haunting gets stuck in it...[ END HERE ] slow-moving groove:::0:::2/5
If Paranormal Activity's domestic brand of spookiness worked on you the first time, you will find a lot to like in this sequel.:::1:::3.5/5
Anyone watching Paranormal Activity 2 closely enough will see that the transitions between different cameras in the film isn't motivated by any internal logic but rather a narrative one.:::1:::3/4
The tension builds in 'Paranormal Activity 2,' a kind of prequel to the hit 'Paranormal Activity.' And I see a Halloween franchise in the making - one that's much weaker and less worthy than the 'Saw' films.:::0:::2/4
This excellent prequel once again proves that in a horror movie, often the less you see, the more intense the story.:::1:::A-
It's not hell, but it's close.:::0:::1.5/5
[A]pe[s] the look and feel of Paranormal Activity but [makes] everything else smaller and lesser. It's a bold choice, if an odd one. And almost entirely predictably, it utterly fails to pay off.:::0:::None
Earns some really nice chills, especially once we hit the big finale.:::1:::3.5/5
In its minimal, low-budget way, Paranormal Activity 2 summons some chills, but it's most of all a scheme to make millions from a miniscule investment.:::0:::2/4
A surprisingly effective follow-up that replicates the creeping dread of the first film and deftly builds on the original storyline.:::1:::3/5
Ultimately, the film has little to offer apart from a few physical shocks involving household objects behaving oddly, a novelty that soon wears off.:::0:::3/5
Despite being almost entirely fine in every possible way, [the film] doesn't work at all as a standalone movie and doesn't work at all as a sequel.:::0:::5/10
A nifty prequel to a nifty original, albeit one which depends for its impact on our once-bitten, twice-shy inklings of what's in store.:::1:::3/5
Another proud entry in the Loud Noises Are Scary sub-genre of horror that fails to engage on anything more than the silliest level. You're better off sticking with Britain's Most Haunted.:::0:::2/5
It's far too slow and repetitive, lacking the tension and surprises of the original.:::0:::2/5
Horror-movie standards have dropped so much that people will flock to anything -- anything at all -- that promises to spook them, no matter how predictable or starved of style.:::0:::None
With little fresh tricks left to play on the viewer, director Tod Williams can only smother the slow-burn effect of the first movie down to a marathon smoulder.:::0:::2.5/5
Clever, sure, and adding a baby and a dog certainly pushes child and pet lovers' fear buttons. But there are less transparent editorial tricks.:::0:::2.5/4
Less scary than a toaster.:::0:::2/5
Once again, somebody is being haunted by a demon, and once again the demon seems less like the Prince of Darkness than the King of the Whoopee Cushion.:::0:::1.5/5
You have to have seen the first one in order to make any sense out of this one. For those who haven't it is a muddled mess:::0:::4/10
For those able to roll with its slow-burn suggestiveness, this superior installment inspires a not-especially-pleasant, Pavlovian level of twitch response that few horror franchises can muster.:::1:::None
can't quite evoke the escalating dread and moments of sheer terror that Peli orchestrated so maliciously in the original film, but it still delivers more than its share of tension and scares:::1:::3/4
Just when we're ready to write the whole thing off as a waste of time, Paranormal Activity 2 steps up to deliver a quietly brilliant ninth inning save.:::1:::B-
In classic fashion, Paranormal Activity 2 repeats its predecessor on a slightly bigger scale to considerably lesser effect.:::0:::None
Even knowing what's likely to come -- the doors opening on their own, the skeptical characters scoffing at metaphysical explanations, the unheeded warnings from paranormally gifted guests -- doesn't make it any less nailbiting to watch.:::1:::None
Clever and impressive. Slow-paced scary. Does not disappoint.:::1:::None
It's simultaneously a lot more expensive and a lot cheaper.:::0:::None
Demons of mediocrity, be gone! Here we have a shrewd sequel a touch better than the original.:::1:::3/4
What's unusual about these movies is that we know those scares are coming, and the filmmakers' drawn-out approach makes them even more effective when they finally arrive.:::1:::4/5
A nullity of a ghost story, whose idea of creating atmosphere is preparing a blank surface for soundtrack bumps-in-the-night to resound off.:::0:::None
he jolts, when they come, are bigger, causing actual physical thrills and chills, at least for me.:::1:::None
'This camera has your eyes,' said the illegal nanny, as she placed it in a high chair and tried to feed it cheerios.:::0:::C
Well, if you loved the first one, here's more of that thing you love.:::1:::3/5
Though Paranormal Activity 2 doesn't quite have the shock value or surprise nature of the first film, it's a fitting sequel and close and respectfully builds on Peli's original, for which kudos should certainly be paid to studio Paramount.:::1:::3/5
Paramount has achieved a rare feat, pumping out a follow-up to a hit indie supernatural thriller that's as good as and remains faithful to the spirit of the original.:::1:::None
Lacks pretty much everything that made the first film such a masterstroke.:::1:::3/5
Were Paranormal Activity 2 released direct-to-DVD, I would have felt it to be more appropriate and forgivable, because that's where it belongs.:::0:::2/5
This franchise nails something that most horror films overlook -- the anticipation of the scare.:::1:::7/10
Cannily marketed as a collective experience, the Paranormal franchise works best in midnight screenings. The hunger for cold, dead chills is usually best indulged in the company of warm, living bodies.:::1:::3/5
The clumsy and obvious byproduct of the financial success of its predecessor last Halloween, this movie has no reason for existing except to provide Paramount Pictures with a few extra shekels.:::0:::2/4
Only time -- and next Halloween -- will reveal it as a franchise killer like Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 or a springboard for a hardy series like Saw II.:::0:::2/5
...all sheen and no grit.:::0:::C-
Gives fans what they want--more of the same--but inevitably the law of diminishing returns comes into play.:::0:::C
New house, new family, same problems, in this rare sequel that is not only a worthy follow-up to the original but also improves upon it by adding extra depth to the story.:::1:::3/4
The sequel repeats the original's formula, but its improved acting and plotting help counteract the lack of conceptual freshness that's inevitable with a second go-round.:::1:::None
As frightening as a bedsheet flapping on a clothesline.:::0:::2/4
As semi-spooky and splatter-free as its predecessor.:::1:::3/5
The filmmakers up the ante here with the addition of a smart teenage girl, an adorable toddler and a protective (but freaked-out) German shepherd named Abby.:::1:::4.5/5
Paranormal Activity 2 returns to theaters with content and panic tactics that are much of the same. That said, the main difference is the film's masterful exploitation of one of the most emotionally scary instruments you could imagine: a baby.:::1:::3.5/5.0
A minor improvement, largely ditching cheap Pavlovian parlor tricks that ruined the first film. However, the coda makes a creaky bid for annual franchise status. At one point, the 1930s are mentioned. Let me guess: Hand-cranked cameras for that one?:::0:::2.5/4
It's kind of distressing how willing the movie is to tread the same old ground. It even goes so far as to replicate one of the original's best money shots.:::0:::2.5/4
Things that go bump in the night have frightened humankind since humankind first existed. It's a fact that both films use to exquisite advantage.:::1:::5/5
While not as original as the first film, it's just as scary and scores points for cleverly tying the two stories together.:::1:::3.5/4
With the first movie, we witnessed the exciting debut of a fresh talent; with the sequel, we're witnessing the studio-mandated birth of a new milked-to-death horror franchise.:::0:::2.5/5
Paranormal Activity 2 should have been a quick, cynical cash in on the original. Instead, it's a chiller that stands tall on its own.:::1:::3/4
Even though much is repeated from the first film...they build to a real sense of dread. It's all rather like those unsettling sounds coming from the attic in "The Exorcist.":::1:::B+
If you're looking for wicked fun this Halloween, Paranormal Activity 2 is the best goosebump game in town.:::1:::2.5/4
Succeeds by giving us another dose of what worked the first time.:::1:::B
Paranormal Activity 2 is that rare instance where all the original scare buttons are pushed, and a bigger canvas actually works.:::1:::3.5/5
Technically accomplished in its fake video-verite style but artistically bankrupt.:::0:::None
As any patient, malevolent spirit would tell you, if it ain't broke, break it at just the right moment.:::1:::3.5/5
Even if it's never quite as chillingly, insidiously real, the sequel -- if that's the right word -- intersects with the first film in a pleasingly malevolent fashion that creeps up on you as the time-code ticks by.:::1:::None
I like how all Hispanics are apparently well-versed in the art of banishing evil spirits. Listen to your Guatemalan nannies, people.:::1:::3/5
As a portrait of an American family under paranormal siege, this can proudly stand next to Poltergeist.:::1:::3/4
The movie numbers the days as they tick away, and along about Day #12 I'm thinking, why are these people still here?:::0:::1.5/4
This is a date-night fright fest that delivers the goods, and will have you checking behind the door when you go to bed at night all over again.:::1:::B
Paranormal Activity 2 sinks much lower than it needs to in order to get a rush out of us - and in the end, the rush isn't even that great.:::0:::None
The expectation builds and builds, sometimes without release, sometimes with a loud sudden noise, or the glimpse of something unexpected. While some horror fans will undoubtedly find the slow pacing dull rather than tense, I find it a breath of fresh air.:::1:::None
A decent (but no more) sequel to the 2009 sleeper horror flick, using semi-effectively similar narrative conception and visual style, benefiting from some new (speechless) characters but suffering from weak ending:::0:::C+
While a far cry from the awfulness of the first installment, this fetid follow-up only makes one long for the brilliance of The Blair Witch Project all the more.:::0:::1.5/5
Paranormal Activity 2 is better made and not quite as paper thin as the original, but by replicating the bare-bones B-film, the sequel sacrifices any chance for distinction.:::0:::None
What was scary once is scary twice, like a carnival funhouse remodeled with a few new mirrors and spring-loaded spooks.:::1:::B
Pretty much a carbon copy of the first film. Full of cheap scares, and goofy connections to part 1 in a misguided effort to build a "mythology" so this cash cow can keep churning out milk.:::0:::3/10
Will satisfy everything but your curiosity.:::1:::B-
If anything, Williams certainly makes the viewer a far more active participant than in the first film, not only due to the greater number of camera options, but also because of the scene composition of each. (Parental Review also Available):::1:::None
A good movie because of the last 20 minutes (which are full of the action the audience wants) and the biggest, most important decision made by the creative team.:::1:::2.5/4
One seriously scary movie containing at least five jolts that will lift you from your seat and/or make you fill your tighty whities.:::1:::4/5
Despite its familiarity, I'd recommend 2 for, appropriately, two reasons: The characters of a dog and a baby -- who can see what's going on in the house but can't verbalize it -- are used deftly.:::1:::2.5/4
Where is Steven Spielberg when you need him for a clever ending? I had trouble sleeping for three weeks after the original film but I slept perfectly fine after the sequel.:::0:::2/5
The best sequences are too familiar from the first movie, leaving a disappointing sense of deja boo.:::0:::2/4
Like the 2009 hit, this is an impressively directed, superbly acted horror flick that creates a creepy atmosphere and delivers some genuinely terrifying shocks, while cleverly building on the ideas from the first film.:::1:::4/5
It's the screenplay that ultimately demonstrates too little imagination, beyond the manner in which it bookends its predecessor.:::0:::None
The movie's shortcomings are the Hollywood literalism in the third act, the need to show us things and connect dots that we don't need to connect.:::0:::2/4
The primary reason Paranormal Activity 2 works is because it doesn't misguidedly try to improve on the formula, or worse, reinvent the wheel.:::1:::7/10
While Paranormal Activity 2 is in many ways similar to the first film, it doesn't just go through the motions with a different set of people - and manages to feel different while also feeling familiar.:::1:::4/5
[PA2] is packed with lousy characters and unneeded mythology. But then the last act ends up delivering, with terrifying moments that raise the bar for modern horror. Someone keep an eye ona comedy and you feel you need to add a goat that eats Viagra and attaches itself to someone's leg, you're probably in trouble.:::0:::C
They're all generally nice people, so there's no reason why they wouldn't get along, except for reasons forced.:::0:::1.5/4
Vacuous and contrived.:::0:::None
Intensely unfunny and persistently insipid, the picture is a chore to sit through, especially with a filmmaker who's clearly working outside of his gifts.:::0:::D-
Laughs? Sorry, they didn't RSVP for this affair. Neither should you.:::0:::None
You almost miss the laugh track. Difficult problems are sidestepped, arguments are overacted, and there are three food fights involving wedding cakes.:::0:::2/4
Unfortunately, but inevitably, Famuyiwa never gets this boulder rolling fast enough to keep its carpet of ancient moss from showing.:::0:::2/5
Be prepared to swallow a lot of empty-calorie jokes in which blacks and Latinos insult and misunderstand one another in a spirit of vigorous buffoonery before dancing together in maniacal harmony during the never-in-doubt wedding-scene finale.:::0:::C-
A broad and formulaic culture-clash comedy built on fill-in-the-blank wedding comedy cliches.:::0:::1.5/4
The interracial meet-the-parents setup pioneered in 1967 by Stanley Kramer's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner gets a modest comic update in Rick Famuyiwa's Our Family Wedding.:::0:::2.5/4
Fathers know foolishness best in this culture-clash family comedy, which presides over a cursed union of slushy sentimentality and dim-witted humor.:::0:::1/5
An unconvincingly broad culture-clash comedy whose Latino and African-American ensemble might've made for a progressive film if director and co-writer Rick Famuyiwa hadn't pandered to the lowest common denominator.:::0:::None
Famuyiwa has made a mostly charming movie despite its cliche milieu.:::0:::None
A broad rom-com that trods over old territory of cultural clashes.:::0:::C+
This broad ethnic farce serves up a full-on culture collision, but -- thanks to a handful of diverting performers -- stops just short of becoming a train wreck.:::0:::None
The culture clash is muy muted in this alternately sweet and dumb comedy.:::0:::None

No ironic detachment for William Dear's latest film: It may have every cliche in the book, but The Perfect Game means everything it says.:::1:::6.5/10
It's all stencil work without a single touch of novelty, inspiration or originality.:::0:::2/5
The Perfect Game proves that you don't always have to reach for lofty heights to work. It's certainly not a classic. It's a simple pleasure for those times when that's all you need.:::1:::None
A welcome addition to the expanding genre of baseball films.:::1:::7/10
It's hard not to root for an underdog, especially a relentlessly optimistic one, and the reality is Game has a lot of heart. But not much in the way of legs.:::0:::5/10
Packed with everything you'd want from an inspiring sports story. The pieces aren't put together as neatly as one would hope, but the film easily achieves the intended effect.:::1:::3.5/5
Notable only for being a catalog of just about every kid-pic cliche' ever committed to film.:::0:::D+
The Perfect Game is an earnest tribute, but the story could have been rendered more convincingly.:::0:::2/4
A very slow and terrible film. This little league baseball story is so full of holes, that even diehard fans of the game would be hard pressed to sit through it. Paul Chambers, CNN.:::0:::C-
This movie is what's known as family entertainment, which means in this case that it's interesting and harmless.:::1:::3/5
Director William Dear is not one to miss a sentimental beat.:::0:::2/4
[From] the second minute of the movie I knew every single thing that was going to happen and there was not a single surprise.:::0:::None
A perfect family movie.:::1:::4/5
It's an unabashedly corny but occasionally stirring dramedy based on the true-life story of scrappy young baseball players from Mexico.:::1:::None
Sentimental, inspiring tale about Little League underdogs.:::1:::3/5
So overwhelmed by its own based-on-actual-events tale that it can't find the tone to tell it effectively.:::0:::None
There has been only one perfect game in the history of the Little League World Series, and the story is as unlikely and as perfect as any underdog sports-movie fairy tale.:::1:::C+
Anyone much older than, say, 10, will likely find the underdog saga sappy and manipulative, not to mention filled with sports movie cliches, including the following statement: "It will take a miracle to make them into a real team.":::0:::2/4
This inspirational film, written by first-timer (and producer) W. William Winokur, is not for cynics or those resistant to cute kids (and child actors sometimes given to mugging).:::1:::3/4
A big, bland serving of corn that wouldn't have been out of place on The Wonderful World of Disney 50 years ago.:::0:::2/4
The script's focus is all over the place, and it surely doesn't help that each uplifting moment of this underdog story feels contrived and cloying.:::0:::1.5/4
Think of it as the "Good News Bears.":::1:::B-
...a bunch of appealing youngsters paired with the terrific character actor Collins and "The Perfect Game," while corny, is less treacly than it could have been.:::1:::C+
A very sweet, very slight family movie that scores smiles and tears of joy.:::1:::2.5/4
The heart of both the story and its telling do help in smoothing over other deficiencies, sweet and disarming in its belief that something like a baseball game can make a bigger difference.:::1:::3/5
The climactic drama of the championship game owes largely to the fact that, despite their unprecedented success as a foreign team in the tournament, young Angel Macias and his teammates somehow didn't go down in history, at least not stateside.:::1:::2.5/4
A paper-thin telling of a genuinely remarkable story that lifts the bullet points of a Mexican team's unprecedented run through the Little League World Series, and fills out the rest with stereotypes and rank sentimentality.:::0:::D+
Serves up both exactly what you expect and then goes a step further by going places one can't anticipate. If you were taken by the first film, it's pretty much a done deal that you'll leave the second on an even greater jittery high.:::1:::3/4
On and on the cheap parlor tricks of Paranormal Activity 2 go, and none of them approach the ingenuity of the ones in the first film.:::0:::2/4
The first film was very good and this new one is quite good. Paranormal Activity 2 does not wear out the concept from the original film although it doesn't leave you wanting more either. It's been fun but this feels like enough.:::1:::3/5
Just more of the same, with the cast aggressively trying to sell the "reality" of this found-footage picture, which only reinforces its obvious artificiality...flattens the initial burst of surprise into irksome retread.:::0:::D+
...there's little doubt that Paranormal Activity 2 ultimately fares slightly better than its pervasively lackluster forebear.:::1:::2.5/4
Much like the original, it skillfully fondles the audience, inspiring both dread and giggles of fear, ending in a flurry of orgiastic terror ... What can I say? I really like these films.:::1:::4/5
Rarely is the second film in a horror franchise more frightening than the original, but Paranormal Activity 2 has more innocent victims and more scares than its predecessor.:::1:::3/4
By resisting the urge to up the action to any significant degree, the sequel simultaneously plays it bold and safe, unusual and familiar.:::1:::3/5
Builds gradual tension on repetitious scenes of domestic tranquility before shattering the calm with an escalating series of events.:::1:::4/5
There's a difference between slow burn and no burn, and sadly Paranormal Activity 2 belongs in the latter camp. It simply isn't engaging or scary. The promise in the premise is never fulfilled and the ending is weak and poorly judged. What a pity.:::0:::None
the most fun you'll have being scared at the movies in 2010, and the most regretful you'll be when you arrive home afterward to an empty house.:::1:::None
Eagle-eyed audiences watching every corner of the screen are rewarded with spooky "did-you-see-that?" moments.:::1:::3/5
Even when nothing is happening, the often dead-silent shots tend to grow scarier the more you look at them.:::1:::B+
Extremely effective as its own movie but even more enjoyable when it connects together with the original, Paranormal Activity 2 is a movie that will satisfy the fans while offering a lot more layers.:::1:::8.5/10
Why do I feel like this is a near-perfect example of how to learn from a first film when building a second film?:::1:::None
If the added slickness and occasionally too-real-to-be-real acting takes one from the premise momentarily, the inherent creepiness and a half-dozen solid jump-in-your-seat moments bring audiences back with jarring effectiveness.:::1:::None
PA2 is an absolute success that is smarter and scarier than the original.:::1:::4.5/5
PA 2 is completely true to its roots, establishing itself as a competent, cohesive and coherent addition to the franchise that not only lives up to the hype, but also builds upon the original's mythology.:::1:::4/5
This is a rare sequel that complements and enhances the original without betraying the elements that made it work in the first place.:::1:::4.5/5
There are a few "jump out of your seat" moments but when you break it down, it's just a simple rehash of the original.:::0:::B-
That damned dogged demon tears another suburban dwelling apart from the inside out in Paranormal Activity 2.:::1:::4/5
:::0:::2/4
Just try not to smile as you watch the imaginative misfit Ramona make classic childhood mistakes in this ebullient adaptation of Beverly Cleary's timeless series.:::1:::None
...an affable yet forgettable little comedy...:::1:::2.5/4
Very entertaining and even heartbreaking in some moments...:::1:::None
Captures the spirit of the Beverly Cleary books and offers a Ramona who's a believable combination of mischief and innocence.:::1:::7/10
Only a twisted, seriously sad individual could have a problem with this sunny tween comedy, which I hated.:::0:::2/5
This sitcom-bright film doesn't come close to the quality of the Beverly Cleary book series, but it's a sweet, frequently charming effort that doesn't betray its G rating.:::1:::2.5/4
Despite everyone's efforts, Ramona comes across as an insufferably spoilt and attention-seeking little horror.:::0:::2/5
Performances are perfectly pleasant, but more of Ramona's flights of fancy and less lingering on the adult romance would've added some oomph.:::0:::2/5
Nothing to frighten the horses, as they say, or interest or entertain them much, either.:::0:::2/5
True, it's just a bit overlong for junior attention spans, but given that the boys get lots of movies with wizards and special effects, little girls will surely welcome a film that seems tailored just for them.:::1:::3/5
Fans of the Ramona Quimby books will be disappointed, but tween girls will love it.:::0:::2/5
The best live action children's film since Nanny McPhee 2.:::1:::4/5
This is an almost quaint throwback of a kids' movie that ends up enjoyably ragtag and cluttered, all of it contained by an emphasis on neighbourhood and maturity. Realistic, refreshing, and reassuring.:::1:::None
This movie understands how to get into the head of a little kid. Plus, there's a little romance for the parents as well.:::1:::7/10
A pleasant way to pass some time and be made happy and sad by little things that are well-observed.:::1:::7/10
A heartwarming little film that makes a genuine connection to the joys and trials of childhood.:::1:::2.5/4
Refreshingly anti-princess and sweet without degrading into sugary, Ramona and Beezus animates Ramona's frequent flights of fancy with DIY-like sequences that literalize, quite charmingly, how a kid colors the world.:::1:::3.5/5
At over 100 minutes, Ramona and Beezus is a hefty cinematic effort to get through, especially considering how audience-surveyed and cliched the film proves:::0:::1.5/4
The true talent of the cast makes up for the too sweet and cute story line:::1:::6/10
It's something that you would not be unhappy seeing on television, [but] there's nothing that calls it for you to go see it on the big-screen.:::1:::None
A pleasant 1950's old-fashioned family drama that's gentle and adorable.:::1:::B
Honesty about the difficulties, both large and small, of being part of a family is what Ramona and Beezus does best, even if the rough and dangerous edges have been filed down.:::1:::5/10
Allen's direction is bright and imaginative; particularly enjoyable are the movie's occasional flights of fancy.:::1:::3/4
Joey King will bounce back.:::0:::2/4
The film tries to appeal to audiences of all ages, and for the most part "reels you in like a sea bass," as Ramona would say.:::1:::3/4
In this vision of Ramona, sincerity is decency and no mores, politics or creeds define those bounds. Screw irony, it's a temp trend anyway.:::1:::3.5/5
Will enchant the 'tween girl audience for whom it was created.:::1:::4/5
[Ramona] deserves better treatment, fairer justice, than she gets in Ramona and Beezus, for no other reason than she's the best thing in it: a rambunctious, bright-eyed mighty mouse with a kaleidoscopic wardrobe and an imagination to match.:::1:::2.5/4
"Ramona and Beezus" is easily the best family movie of the year, so far.:::1:::A-
There are so many diversions and subplots, it's hard to get caught up in any single story.:::0:::2.5/4
Sure, the film's reality may be saccharine, but for a non-computer animated, non-3D kid's film, we'll take it.:::1:::B-
Ramona and Beezus has enough charm to forgive it an unnecessary foray onto romantic-comedy turf.:::1:::2.5/4
It's always a challenge for actors to meet the expectations readers have in their heads. These performances offer pleasure throughout.:::1:::4.5/5
Parents may also be happy to see a movie for children that doesn't involve wizards, vampires or action figures that can be bought in the food court.:::1:::3/5
I can't think of another movie that captures rambunctious, freespirited modern little-girlness the way that this one does, and in a way that isn't dumbed down or sugared over...:::1:::None
Successful on its own terms in its refusal to talk down to its pre-teen audience and through the massive future star-power of its talented young stars.:::1:::None
Gets right what most matters, above all Ramona herself.:::1:::B+
Beloved book girl comes to life in sweet, kid-friendly tale.:::1:::3/5
The sweet sisterhood story based on the Beverly Cleary books doesn't talk down to kids and presents parents as appealing and vulnerable.:::1:::3/4
Ramona and Beezus is the summer's sweetest surprise.:::1:::4.5/5
Child actress King is a real find; plenty of kids will be asking for a sequel.:::1:::3/4
This is a lively affair, largely thanks to the sweet and snappy screenplay by Laurie Craig and Nick Pustay and to the appealing performances by the cast.:::1:::3/4
As a fan of the books, I was skeptical that the movies could re-create their gentle, humane, messy spirit. But I'm happy to report that Ramona and Beezus captures the characters almost perfectly and that Joey King is an ideal Ramona.:::1:::4/4
Relative unknown Joey King, as Ramona, is on the right side of precocious, using her adorableness in carefully measured doses. She easily carries the movie.:::1:::B+
...a family film that really can be enjoyed by the whole family.:::1:::3.5/5
The resulting story is a jumble, and there are too many side characters, but golly if it isn't pretty darned infectious.:::1:::B-
The more, where there could be less, has the story dragging its feet.:::0:::2.5/4
The overall effort is pleasant enough to sit through. Yet, with some pairing down of story elements in favor of increasing Ramona's childhood imagination, the film might have become something of a cinematic classic. (Parental Review also Available):::1:::None
As in the books, the Quimby family is instantly relatable and utterly irresistible, funny, touching, and completely endearing.:::1:::B+
Appealing, funny, honest, and all that jazz, but who could have expected it to be this touching?:::1:::3/4
King is good enough that you can't help but root for her. But frankly, I can't imagine paying full ticket price plus concessions for that privilege.:::0:::C
To say the film is sitcom-y is to belabor the obvious. "Ramona and Beezus" is a welcome throwback to the nuclear-family-centered sitcoms of the 1950s and '60s and a low-tech charmer, and the cast elevates it all, especially King.:::1:::B+
Tenderness isn't a quality found much these days in the whirring-and-clanging busyness of family movies, which makes this G-rated gem's emphasis on emotion and heart all the more laudable.:::1:::3.5/5
Here's a summer movie release that's not filled with big explosions or action sequences, and one of the few films aimed at kids that isn't animated or in 3-D.:::1:::2.5/4
Amiable but innocuous family movie, which would be more at home on a cable channel than theatre screens but should nevertheless amuse young girls and their mothers.:::0:::C+
With her chestnut bob and eyes twinkling with mischief, Joey King looks the part & embodies the spirit of Ramona, diving into memorable set pieces with unadulterated joy.:::1:::None
King and Corbett both overplay their hands at film's beginning but they develop great chemistry, know comic timing and settle in quickly.:::1:::B
Flooded with warm light and a radiant mood, Ramona and Beezus is a sunny series of charming escapades and subtle flights of fancy that capture the safe fusion of imagination and reality where all little girls should grow up.:::1:::3/4
I could go on and on with a list of the things wrong with The Perfect Game, but none would explain why I was a misty-eyed sucker for it in the end.:::1:::B
Think south-of-the-border Bad News Bears.:::1:::None
This entertaining film is so full of factual inaccuracies that are unnecessary they degrade the final product.:::1:::7/10
there is a tricky line for a film to walk between earnest sweetness and syrupy schmaltz. The Perfect Game pulls off this balancing act with a combination of smart direction and even smarter casting:::1:::4/5
Well-meaning but thick with cliches.:::0:::None
The film is perfectly mediocre, which is heartbreaking, not heartwarming.:::0:::1.5/4
You sort of know how these underdog sports movies turn out. Doesn't matter. The Perfect Game so expertly uses the charisma and personalities of the actors, especially the young ones, that it's thrilling anyway.:::1:::3/4
What's surprising are the poignant undercurrents about race and jingoism.:::1:::3/4
The odd engaging moment is always followed by a cloying eye-roller, such as when a nearly-new ball appears on their dusty Monterey sandlot. "Father, what does it mean?" "It means God wants us to play baseball!":::0:::1.5/4
Although based on the real-life tale of nine underage underdogs from Monterrey, Mexico who swept the 1957 Little League World Series, this Cinderella sports story rings false from first pitch to last.:::0:::1/5
(Recommended for) Little League coaches and teams whose schedules look like 10-run rules waiting to happen. Kids on the sweet end of that rule will scoff at this overly earnest story of diamond underdogs winning.:::0:::2/4
It's unforgivably clunky at times, but as a whole, the picture is innocuous enough to give family audiences a decent underhand pitch of approachable hopes and dreams.:::1:::B-
Baseball movies generally lean toward the mawkishly uplifting, an inclination wholly embraced by The Perfect Game, which resorts to such corniness that one can practically hear the screen crunching.:::0:::1/4
As much about sports trophies as a triumph over the racism and sexism of the time. And that rare film for children with problem-solving solutions other than violence, in a not always welcoming world.:::1:::None
Doesn't have the artistry of Hoosiers, but it is blessed with a strong real-life story, and stresses a series of uplifting life lessons.:::1:::None
Here's a sweetly mannered sports movie with heart, that's ideal for introducing baseball traditions and vocabulary to kids.:::1:::B-
Resident Evil: Afterlife recycles nearly every horror convention. The plot is not original and the 3D is quite bad. And since we've literally seen all this before, it's only occasionally entertaining, and rarely interesting.:::0:::3/10
Resident Evil: Afterlife sees Anderson returning to cinematic dreck with a stunningly tedious exercise in 3-D CGI wankery.:::0:::1.5/5
Another Resident Evil zombie film with no brains but plenty of over-the-top action should still sate the appetite of certain viewers.:::0:::2.5/5
The very definition of 'switch your brain off' entertainment.:::0:::2/5
It's loud, bland, gory, and has very little to offer in the way of story. Don't tell me you were actually expecting something else.:::0:::1.5/4
With a simple plot paired with great action scenes in its brisk run time, that's all I really need from the series and 'Resident Evil: Afterlife' puts some new blood and excitement into what was close to becoming a dead franchise.:::1:::8/10
The action, however spirited in its manic creativity, is so relentlessly repetitive that it ceases to be as cool as the director plainly imagines it to be a very long time before the end of the movie .:::0:::3/10
The occasional flashes of imagination aside, "Afterlife" epitomizes what movies written largely by software and marketing committees look like:::0:::2/4
There's not one good reason for this franchise to exist. Give your ticket money to charity instead.:::0:::1.5/5
The law of diminishing returns rears its ugly, ugly head with Resident Evil: Afterlife, the fourth movie in a series that is going absolutely nowhere.:::0:::3/10
"Resident Evil: Afterlife" is watchable at times. Then, the story breaks down and you lose patience. There are plenty of action scenes, so if that's what you seek. Go for it. Paul Chambers, CNN.:::0:::D
Tons of action and butt-kicking, but the story is on autopilot, performances are stilted, and the film's budget can't keep up with director Anderson's daunting scope and scale.:::0:::5/10
True to series form, plot is nearly indiscernible, but this fourth installment in the sci-fi/horror/action franchise created by writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson is the sleekest so far, thanks to 3D and star Milla Jovovich's body-hugging catsuit.:::1:::None
Wasn't all this going someplace at one time? The mind boggles at all of the incredible things these two women could be doing in wet, dirty clothes.:::0:::1.5/4.0
The DVD needs to come with a drinking game feature, do you hear me Sony?:::1:::3.5/5
A movie that makes the "Dawn" remake look brilliant...:::0:::None
full review at Movies for the Masses:::0:::2/5
Cheap hits of bang-bang adrenaline occasionally rise up but any rush is quickly tempered by the processed banality lulling you into a coma of fast-food filmmaking.:::0:::2/5
Resident Evil: Afterlife ... is boring, but you probably already knew that. The primary source of inspiration for the screenplay seems to be Alien 3 -- the very worst of the Alien films -- in both its content and incomprehensibility.:::0:::1.5/5
I thought it was great fun. Paul W.S. Anderson -- it's his greatest hit adapting video games to movies.:::1:::3.5/5
Bound to please the legions of Milla fans who have doubtless poured over the extras-rich DVDs of the first three Resident Evils, as well as her please-sequel-this gem Ultra Violet.:::1:::3.5/5
I seriously doubt there is anyone out there in modern motion pictures who looks to be having less fun at work than Milla Jovovich. Behind that supermodel sneer is one totally bored woman.:::0:::2/5
At least you know what to expect with this sort of film, and you don't get anything more.:::0:::None
Whether or not you are a series regular, you are unlikely to encounter anything here that you haven't met before in the sci-fi/horror movie universe.:::0:::2/5
Paul W.S. Anderson has discovered his favourite new gimmick - slow motion. Had Afterlife played at full speed, it probably would have lasted all of 15 minutes. Wouldn't that have been nice.:::0:::2/5
How many more Resident Evil films are they going to make? Hopefully the answer is zero.:::0:::C-
Inventive ideas, dazzling 3D and spectacular production design elevate this fourth in the franchise to a juicy bite above the average zombie movie.:::1:::None
Upping the action at every turn, this contains fantastic battle sequences and a kickass heroine wisely made relatable to audiences.:::1:::None
Your level of enjoyment of this depends on how much you like Anderson?s slo-mo decapitations and other forms of gory special effects.:::0:::2.5/4
By this time, only aficionados will be keeping up with the series mythology; the rest of us will have to accept or reject this sequel as an exercise in unbridled, surreal, nonsensical action-cool -- as much a head trip, in its way, as 'Koyaanisqatsi.':::1:::3/4
It's the least like a video game, so "Afterlife" is the best of the lot.:::1:::2/4
The new Paul W. S. Anderson movie, "Resident Evil: Afterlife," features one scene that's memorable, if only because it's so comical. You were looking for more than one memorable scene? Wrong movie.:::0:::D+
[The] Resident Evil saga continues to be one of the millennium's only adequate B-movie franchises.:::1:::B
O surpreendente 3D acaba tornando o filme mais relevante que seus antecessores - mesmo que Paul W.S. tenha alcancado este pequeno sucesso por acidente.:::0:::2/5
... 3-D, where bad sequels go to die ...:::0:::1/5
Same as the others; watchable if you like mindless, gory, zombie exploits. Others need not apply.:::0:::2.5/5
The good news: If you're a fan of the unkillable video game adaptation, then don't worry; it looks like there's going to be yet another installment in the Resident Evil series.:::0:::1.5/5
Resident Evil: Afterlife lacks the humanity -- interesting characters, funny one-liners -- that made its predecessors enjoyable B-movies.:::0:::1/4
There is not a single shot or moment that is anything other than derivative, and the fact that the momentum is constantly interrupted with egregious slow motion makes it feel that much longer and therefore more insufferable.:::0:::1.5/4
Brash and bombastic this new entry might be, but it's also criminally boring.:::0:::2/5
The plot? Does it matter?:::0:::1.5/5
I was sorry to see the zombie crows from the last film make only a token appearance here, but this was balanced by a return of the zombie Dobermans from the first movie.:::0:::2.5/5
Just hearing the audience gasp from vertigo during the opening zoom-out shot is almost worth the price of admission.:::1:::3/4
Resident Evil: Afterlife is loud, boring, derivative, has zero tension and is the kind of movie that could only possibly be liked if the viewer has never seen any other post-apocalyptic zombie flick.:::0:::1/5
This franchise has sailed far past rhyme and reason, and planted a flag in a whole new continent of crapness.:::0:::1/5
More of the same, but if you enjoy this kind of thing, that's not necessarily a bad thing.:::1:::2.5/4
Anderson makes often-inspiring use of the 3-D effects, though he never quite tops the opening Shibuya Crossing bloodbath.:::1:::3/5
The action is easier to read than in most films of the genre, and therefore more enjoyable. Anderson makes particular use of sets and locations to wring out more bang for the stereoscopic buck.:::1:::3/5
Perhaps these conundrums will be answered in future installments (Resident Evil: Coherence?) but I wouldn't hold my breath. Best to just send in the clones.:::0:::3.5/10
Afterlife is very likely to please at least most of the fans of the series, but don't expect too much aside from Milla looking great and a groovy visual style.:::1:::3/5
Yes, the 3D is immersive... but there's nothing to be immersed in here but the blood, bullets, and globs of brainmatter flying around.:::0:::None
Afterlife lacks tension, dread, angst, humor-you name an emotion, it's not there.:::0:::1/4
If critics and fanboys weren't suckers for simplistic nihilism and high-pressure marketing, Afterlife would be universally acclaimed as a visionary feat, superior to Inception and Avatar on every level.:::1:::None
There are worse ways to pass an hour and a half than watching Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter shooting the hell out of zombies and mutants.:::1:::4/5
Good action but nothing else - and the open ended ending is getting old.:::0:::5/10
The reason to see it: the awesome 3D. The reason not to see it: everything else.:::0:::5/10
Everything after its striking opening battle sequence is downhill in this predictably sad addition to a flawed movie franchise based on a video game.:::0:::C-
The improved sheen of 'Afterlife' doesn't compensate for the feeling that the franchise has really run out of the little steam it ever had.:::0:::D-
All in all, it's not particularly smart or original, but it's also not all that bad.:::0:::2/5
More insulting than the stereotyping and the horrifying horror cliches is the fact that the formulaic tale even has the nerve to end on a cliffhanger, setting us up for yet another sequel. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me five times? I don't think so.:::0:::1/4
Gory, pointless, pretentious and tedious, ending in a splattering cliffhanger, so you can expect this survival horror series to continue if it resonates at the box-office.:::0:::2/10
While the movie itself is no great shakes, the 3D is awesomely fun.:::0:::2.5/4
Would this movie have been made if not for the 3D Gimmick? Milla Jovovich commands the screen and makes all the RE films a fun ride. If you hate the series, this won't change your mind.:::1:::B-
Jovovich remains the lone light in the increasingly lackluster videogame-based zombie franchise, which barrels through its fourth installment with a threatened fifth on the way.:::0:::None
Milla Jovovich sashays through the ludicrous mayhem once more, this time in 3D.:::0:::2/5
It's seldom scary, and it's never very exciting, but it does achieves its goal of delivering a little mindless entertainment.:::0:::None
Like pretty much all of Anderson's films, this one is half-baked. The half that's baked isn't too bad, though.:::0:::C+
like a poorly made cream puff -- fancy and somewhat rarified on the outside, as empty as an airhead's thought process on the inside:::0:::1.5/5
'Resident Evil: Afterlife 3D' is more disappointing than the previous films only because they added nothing new than having derivative slow motion sequences, bad acting and an incoherent storyline.:::0:::1/4
If there is an afterlife, I hope to God this movie isn't playing there.:::0:::1/5
To call it bad goes without saying, but it takes a cold heart indeed not to smile at least a few times during its length.:::0:::C
This witless installment features the usual ultra-slow-motion mayhem and helpful freeze-frames to allow us to admire the extra dimension. Fans will not be happy, however, to learn that Ms. Jovovich is more decently clothed this time around.:::0:::1/5
Resident Evil's appeal as a series is almost exclusively rooted in Jovovich's charisma. She combines the enigmatic magnetism of a silent-movie siren with the bravado of an action hero.:::1:::B-
Afterlife is slow-moving but relentless, and judging from a post-credits teaser that promises at yet another sequel, it has an unquenchable appetite for your brain cells.:::0:::D
On the plus side, here is an action franchise that features two strong women as its main protagonists. On the minus side - well, there's pretty much the rest of the movie. (Parental Review also Available:::0:::None
Zombies and Jovovich in goryous 3D, unencumbered by plot and character development.:::0:::None
It's a humorless movie of morphing zombies (they take on beastly attributes), phoned-in performances and trite dialogue.:::0:::1/4
State-of-the-art 3D effects add a welcome dose of visual freshness to the fourth installment of this video game-based franchise.:::1:::None
A post-apocalyptic zombie flick featuring zombies that aren't very terrifying and doom-and-gloom vibes that lack any real edge.:::0:::2/5
Like a grease-laden fast-food meal, the fourth and highest-budgeted installment in the videogame-based tale of bio warfare gone amuck is slick, tasty, gimmick-laden and literally in-your-face:::1:::B
Like one of its lumbering undead, this video game franchise is hard to kill. The fourquamarine, tells the Quimbys' story gracefully. She elicits remarkably honest performances from her younger stars.:::1:::3/4
This new Ramona prefers mischief without real edge. You always know her parachute has a silver lining, even in an economic downturn. She is, above all, safe. And that makes her nowhere near as entertaining or enduring as the girl on the page.:::0:::2/4
All of these moments are presented completely without cynicism or judgment, and their joyousness is infectious.:::1:::3.5/5
There's nothing really wrong with it. But there's nothing amazingly right about it either, unless, of course, it sends young viewers marching off to libraries to find the real Klickitat Street for themselves.:::1:::B-
"Ramona and Beezus" is a small-scale story of life and learning, of setbacks large and small and triumphs major and minor. It is neither dark nor dour, but it also does not kid itself about the messy realities of life as part of a family.:::1:::3.5/5
Gingerly gentle and generic, it plays like a sweet sitcom, better suited to the small screen than the large.:::0:::5/10
This all sounds like uptight, grown-up nitpicking, probably. But it's also a reflection of a weakness in storytelling, which is sad given the strength of the source material.:::0:::None
For the grown-ups there are sweet, sincere performances by Ginnifer Goodwin, Sandra Oh, and, as Ramona's endlessly game father, the likable John Corbett.:::1:::None
Resistance is futile; the movie's relentless wholesomeness will batter down the defenses of all but the most determined curmudgeon.:::1:::3/5
To its credit and occasional folly, Ramona and Beezus is goofy and candy-coated like childhood, with only a pretend grip on real life.:::1:::3/5
It won't change anyone's world, but it'll keep kids happy -- and cool -- for a couple of hours.:::1:::2.5/5
With very little to differentiate [itself] from dozens of other movies meant solely for young girls, Ramona and Beezus certainly shows potential to be a better movie than it is.:::0:::5.5/10
The movie is not bad, but it's not much.:::1:::2.5/4
Feels like being bound in a thick, homemade quilt, rolled up to a campfire, and smothered in toasted marshmallow goo.:::0:::None
My advice is to stay away from Elizabeth Allen's bland and banal adaptation, which plays like a contemporary Leave It to Beaver without irony or ingenuousness.:::0:::1.5/4
A labored picture, eschewing the breeze of simplicity to cram all available chapters into a picture that eventually slows to a maddening crawl. To that, I fling a mighty "Guts!" to the filmmakers.:::0:::C
We no longer all watch the same TV shows, we are no longer as innocent, and the world of Klickitat is fading into timeless nostalgia. Ramona and Beezus is a sweet salute.:::1:::3/4
Mostly it's just Ramona making a mess of things, without the consequences of cleaning up afterward.:::0:::2/5
Newcomer Joey King is a blue-eyed dynamo who brings Ramona Quimby vividly to life and steals the show from her veteran co-stars.:::1:::3.5/5
There are more laughs in the average episode of Gomez's Wizards of Waverly Place TV show than in this.:::0:::2/4
This proud graduate of the School of Cleary Classics wishes that, like the young heroine herself, Ramona and Beezus dared more often to color outside the lines.:::1:::B-
She's been brave and she's been a pest, but until this adaptation of Beverly Cleary's beloved children's books, pint-size protagonist Ramona Quimby has never been so blatantly market-driven.:::0:::2/5
A loose adaptation of Beverly Cleary's first novel in her beloved kid-lit series that's wholesome to the point of being dull.:::0:::None
Teen star Selena Gomez as Beezus may have top billing, but the real star is Joey King as her younger, gangly sister.:::1:::2.75/5
A sprightly, generic kidpic that flattens and condenses elements from Beverly Cleary's deservedly popular novels.:::0:::None
The cinematic adventures of Beverly Cleary's pint-sized big dreamer comes up short on scope and imagination.:::0:::None

Shrek Forever After is a very mediocre affair, with crummy 3D and a real lack of laughs.:::1:::6/10
"Shrek Forever After" feels more like a direct-to-video release than one that should have been put in theaters.:::0:::2.5/4
Shrek Forever After is a fairy tale ending for the series.:::1:::4/5
Shrek Forever After is the latest in a long, mediocre tradition. What charms it does have can't really compete with the charms it doesn't have.:::0:::6/10
DreamWorks and the unlovable ogre lose the plot.:::0:::3/5
Shrek's inspired mash-up of the world of fairy tales and contemporary pop culture is now yielding diminishing returns.:::0:::None

...sweet and gentle, and the conclusion, while expected, carries a good deal of touching sentiment.:::1:::6/10
It's sweet, mildly funny, and a pleasant enough farewell from these once beloved characters. But there's a somewhat melancholy tone to the proceedings, as we watch this franchise try to hold onto its final shreds of dignity.:::1:::3/5

Interestingly, ...Forever After's biggest influence appears not to be fairy tales this time, but rather the Back To The Future series.:::1:::3/5
Shrek Forever After brings the long-running saga to a lively close, reminding each of the characters about the love and friendship which bind them together.:::1:::None
The movie is a family drama about the family drama, so on every available level it works a treat.:::1:::4/5
It's a neat enough way of closing the book -- and one hopes it is closed now.:::1:::3/5
Has a warm, engaging tone that draws us into the dramatic possibilities rather than the comical ones:::1:::3.5/5
It isn't quite as witty or inventive as you might have hoped but if it is the last film in the series then it offers an honourable conclusion to a wonderful decade of family entertainment.:::1:::3/5
An improvement over the last film...:::1:::3/5
I admit my gentle, feelgood buzz on leaving the cinema was rather premised on the assumption that the Shrek-pipeline is now empty, but it's an enjoyable film nonetheless and a nice way for the series to finish.:::1:::3/5
Shrek Forever After is an amiable but underpowered conclusion to a franchise that ran out of comic ideas six years ago. It is time to lay this ogre to rest.:::0:::2/5
If we all loved the first film, enjoyed the second and were disappointed by the third, this fourth and final entry ends the Shrek series on a satisfying high note.:::1:::3/5
While it will have to settle for being the second best sequel of the franchise, Shrek's last outing ultimately reminds you of why we fell in love with these characters in the first place.:::1:::3/5
Obviously inspired by It's a Wonderful Life, Shrek may not be able to match Frank Capra's delicious pathos, but this is a fitting final chapter for the franchise.:::1:::None
Now is the time for DreamWorks to return to the drawing board; to use this $2.5 billion series to invest in something as thrilling and adventurous as the original Shrek.:::1:::3/5
The film is engaging enough, due to a narrative gimmick that makes the old ground new again.:::1:::3/5
This fourth ogre outing delivers plenty of 3D razzle dazzle and has fun messing about with its alternate-reality storyline, but it never troubles the modernclassic status achieved by the first Shrek. Still, a chunky step up from Shrek The Third.:::1:::3/5
Much better than its predecessor, but not a patch on the original, Shrek Forever After would be a respectable point for the irritable ogre's tale to come to an end.:::1:::3/5
An entertaining conclusion to the franchise -- one that parents should happily endure. But let's hope that's all, folks.:::1:::3/5
DreamWorks could be entering a period of fresh creativity. With How To Train Your Dragon and a balanced, darker-hued and very funny Shrek finale, they've found the magic again.:::1:::4/5
Impressively directed and superbly animated, this is a clever reworking of It's A Wonderful Life that manages to freshen up the franchise, allowing for a much darker tone and a subtle revamping of all the characters...:::1:::4/5
The timing feels right for the big green guy to pass the torch to the new dragon on the block.:::0:::C
There's no life to the film, no spark, and more importantly no real reason for this fourth outing to have ever been made.:::0:::1/5
It is like It's A Wonderful Life replayed in the world of the Grimms, as Shrek (along with the viewer) is made to realise what he was, what he has become, and what he has lost in the process.:::1:::None
A welcome relief. However, it is still far, far away from the heights of the first two installments.:::1:::3/5
If anything, it's much better than the third chapter.:::1:::2.75/5
It's not as engaging as the original, but a nice step up from the disappointing third installment.:::1:::2.5/4
If you've enjoyed the ride so far, be sure not to miss one last adventure with Shrek and his crew.:::1:::B
As far as blatant milking of cash-cows go, it retains much of the heart and charm of the franchise, if not the cracking humour.:::1:::3.5/5
DreamWorks could be entering a period of fresh creativity. With How To Train Your Dragon and a balanced, darker-hued and very funny Shrek finale, they've found the magic again.:::1:::4/5
The Shrek franchise is a hugely enjoyable one, with funny characters and a knowing way with mocking fairy-tales and popular culture.:::1:::3/5
Third times are rarely charms in the movies, much less fourth go-rounds, and it takes more than ho-hum 3D and video-game-ready action sequences to liven up diminishing returns.:::0:::2/5
Too willing to slavishly pillage from the original film, right down to similar montage sequences with the same "Smash Mouth" style soft rock musical accompaniment. It is all perfectly competent, reasonably amusing and completely unimaginative.:::0:::None
Shrek Forever After feels tired, but is lifted by the usual slew of wisecracks and pop culture references. The use of 3-D, while not revelatory, is apt, and adds another layer of appeal to the film's action.:::1:::3/5
A rise in quality from the very pedestrian Shrek the Third.:::1:::3/5
A supreme example of movie junk food.:::1:::None
Shrek 4 shows all the signs of mortuus equus syndrome -- as in, flogging the horse which is not just sleeping.:::0:::3/5
All in all, it's not the spectacular send-off Shrek deserves but, as a way to get out, it's not too shabby either.:::1:::3/5
The writing is brisk and funny, the situation allows for plenty of adventure to keep our characters busy and Shrek himself takes a big lesson in learning to treasure what he's really got:::1:::None
Brilliant animation, 3D magic and a subversive script filled with quirky humour transports us to Swamp Heaven for this perfect Shrek final chapter. It's a whirlwind of a film:::1:::None
What's been achieved here is still highly hilarious. The original concepts are that solid.:::1:::4/5
The key, as Fiona points out, is to know when you have everything, and be grateful. It's a worthy conclusion to the tale. We can all live happily ever after.:::1:::3/4
Though it's jumped on the 3D bandwagon, the fourth Shrek is almost surprisingly clunky and old.:::0:::None
By the middle of the second act, Forever After finally finds its groove, becoming mildly amusing (the actors -- Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas -- are in fine form) but never rising to the inspired heights of the original.:::0:::None
This "final chapter" doesn't try too hard %u2014 save for the finale %u2014 to become an after-school special, the way the dreadfully dull Shrek the Third did.:::1:::3/4
Better than the last film, but the latest in this disappointing franchise is "Shrek" out of luck.:::0:::C+

All the whiners who bashed the other revisionist sequels better raise arms here too. It'll amuse me to see Shrek fans get as angry as Spider-Man fans.:::1:::None
It's a Shrek-derful Midlife Crisis:::0:::2.5/5
All the edge, all the wit, all the refreshing originality that made the earlier films in the franchise so enjoyable have been all but drained from the swamp this go round.:::0:::2.5/4
The winking nonstop pop-culture references are as annoying as ever, but the witch army is cool, and there's no denying that Donkey, Puss in Boots, the Gingerbread Man, Pinocchio and the other supporting characters are pretty funny.:::0:::2.5/4
It cuts back on the rapid-fire pop culture references that dominate the other films to focus on the story, but unfortunately, the story isn't all that interesting.:::0:::1.5/4

A fitting fourth film in the animated series, Shrek Forever After is a mature story of romance and regret, and yet hilarious enough for kids and grownups alike.:::1:::None
A dumbed-down ripoff strictly for the tyke demographic too young to notice that the flick's a thinly-veiled retread.:::0:::1/4
After the original spoof of fairy tales and Disney fare, it's taken three sequels to finally get one right. Now please stop.:::1:::3.0/4.0
There probably will not be another Shrek movie, but if there isn't, this is a good place to end the franchise, and two out of three is a far better average, as far as quality goes, than most sequels.:::1:::B

My mind kept wandering from what was happening on screen, which never occurred during the previous and highly entertaining Shrek adventures.:::0:::None
Somewhat clever, heartfelt and much darker than its predecessors, but it's ultimately forgettable and not nearly as diverting as it could have been for kids and adults simultaneously.:::0:::5.82/10
[It] may not be especially funny; it may not have any tremendously compelling reason to exist... but by God, it's not as dispiriting as Shrek the Third.:::0:::5/10

You don't have to be a second coming of Albert Einstein to figure out how it will all end, but that doesn't stop Shrek Forever After from having a tremendous amount of heart.:::1:::4/5
Side by side, the four Shrek films look like the stages of man. You have Shrek as ogre, Shrek as husband, Shrek as daddy, and now, Shrek as George Bailey.:::1:::C+
Fiona's fierce, Shrek's lovable in still-funny 4th movie.:::1:::3/5
Every frame of this film reeks of a project that has been conceived and executed merely to fulfill the bare minimum to get audiences into seats. They know that if they tell a few jokes and bring back the characters you love, that you'll pay to see it. Act:::0:::None
It's no classic, but Shrek Forever After is a pleasant reminder that every time a cash register rings, this ogre turns angelic.:::1:::2.5/4
It feels narratively overcooked and comically undernourished, a pale shadow of the earlier entries.:::0:::2/4
This latest episode may be agreeably snappy and snarky -- improving considerably on 2007's stale Shrek the Third -- but it's also evidence the series is out of ideas.:::1:::3/5
Shrek Forever After wanders far, far away from the infectious and propulsive zing that we've come to expect over the past nine years.:::0:::2.5/4
It means well, it tries hard, but it's spinning stew out of an oyster and the results are just too thin and watery to hold up.:::0:::C
The shout line on the Shrek Forever After poster says it best: It ain't ogre till it's ogre.:::1:::3/4
Who is supposed to be excited by this? What child would care? What adult would care?:::0:::C-
Directed with zest by Mike Mitchell (from a script by Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke) and shot in 3D, this final Shrek sequel has plenty of verve.:::1:::3/4
Director Mike Mitchell and screenwriters Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke, all relatively new to the franchise, manage to lead the winning returning cast in a fresh direction.:::1:::4.5/5
Mike Myers deserves a ton of credit for making "Shrek" an enduring and endearing part of our film vernacular.:::1:::None
Do we really need a movie about SHREK's midlife crisis? Really?:::0:::5.5/10
Forever After feels like a tired yank on the udders of a cash cow that's nearly dry.:::0:::2/4
Shrek still mopes around too much. But he recovers nicely with a good bit of help from his friends, Donkey and Puss, as fine a pair of sidekicks as filmdom has produced.:::1:::2.5/4
Somehow, the big green guy manages to make the whole gang fall in love with him all over again.:::1:::None
Mr. Murphy's toothy, shifty-eyed Donkey who distills the series' attitude of cheerfully curdled hipness. In his eternal upbeat cheekiness, he is a creation to rival Peter Pan.:::1:::3/5
Even though Forever After is not as fresh-seeming as its predecessors, it provides passable entertainment, especially for the kids who won't be familiar with the George Bailey storyline retread -- or midlife crises, for that matter.:::1:::2.5/5
Shrek's "It's A Wonderful Life," plus lots of action and Donkey teeth in 3-D.:::1:::3/4
Let Shrek Forever After be the final Shrek chapter so the franchise can end on a reasonably high note.:::1:::3/4
"Shrek Forever After" lacks the charm and freshness of the original. It does entertain, though, because of its winning recipe of popular characters, humor and storytelling.:::1:::2.5/4
Forges a pretty bulletproof family film from what from what I, at least, feared would be a worn-out formula.:::1:::None
Where Shrek the Third got a bit green around the gills, this latest take, puffed up in 3D and defibrillated back to life with a snappy story, makes for some monstrously good fun.:::1:::8/10
"It's mildly entertaining, infused with the pleasant nostalgia you experience visiting friends you only get to see every few years. ... But the laughs aren't there anymore.":::0:::2/4
This is nothing more than a tired and creatively bankrupt attempt to further stretch out a property that never should have turned into a franchise in the first place.:::0:::2/5
The fourth Shrek runs out of steam from the start, cribbing from its predecessors in a last desperate attempt to evoke some of that old magic.:::0:::2.5/4
If you had a tough time getting through Shrek the Third, you'll probably have an even tougher time with Shrek Forever After. Oh, but it's in 3-D. That should make things pop, but it didn't make much of an impression, sort of like the rest of the animati:::0:::2/4
The best since the original! Dead funny, imaginative and hip %u2013 and if Shrek goes out on this note, it's a good thing.:::1:::B
...for once, the creators of this creaky series try something new and fresh.:::1:::3/5
They ought to be happy they found a way to go out on top with a good movie. Please don't follow through with the idea of doing a 5th Shrek movie.:::1:::3.5/4
After a disappointing third outing, this Shrek brings the cycle of fairy-tale-themed films to a fine finish.:::1:::3/4
Benjamin Franklin once said, "Fish and guests stink after three days." The same could be said of movie franchises that overstay their welcome. With Shrek Forever After, the magic is gone but at least the heart is back.:::1:::5/10
After the frantic spurt of fairy-tale allusions and jokes in the first three Shreks, this one inches along with a few mostly pointless action scenes and the occasional mild pun.:::0:::1/4
Like last year's Up, this isn't merely a cute kid's movie with funny one-liners and adorable critters. It's a soulful meditation on the age-old question: Is that all there is?:::1:::None
Fresh, funny and, for once, a sequel worthy of summer blockbuster status.:::1:::3.5/4
A sunny, sweet and satisfying animated comedy.:::1:::3/4
Shrek Forever After is an improvement on the third film but misses that comedic balance that the first two films delivered.:::1:::3/5
For once ... I hope the filmmakers haven't ruled out another sequel. As Shrek Forever After proves, there's life in the big green guy yet.:::1:::3/4
What saves Shrek Forever After from utter mediocrity isn't its high-priced superstar voice talent but veteran animator Dohrn, who steals the show by making Rumplestilskin the best oily runt since Danny DeVito last dispatched a taxi.:::1:::2.5/4
Fanciful and, hopefully, franchise-concluding, it should have a long and prosperous life on dvd.:::0:::6/10
You've seen Shrek and it was good. If you want to know what Shrek would be like if it wasn't good, then see Shrek Forever After.:::0:::3/5
If there were a Shrek TV show, this could be the two-part finale of, say, season 3. It isn't bad. It just doesn't belong on a movie screen.:::0:::C+
The series exits (hopefully) on the right note. It's not because it comes close to the achievement of the first two films ... but because it gets out before we turn from amused detachment to fed-up annoyance.:::0:::2.5/4
As was the case with the third outing, this one isn't terrible. It just feels mediocre and recycled using the "It's a Wonderful Life" themes to try to breathe some new life into the series (Parental Content Review also included):::1:::None
The film's expert balance of humor, heart, and excitement is real movie magic.:::1:::A-
So fear not, "Shrek Forever After" is not a S-wreck. But unfortunately it's not S-great, either.:::1:::2.5/4
The latest in the franchise is better than its predecessors, mainly because of the 3D, but should (please gods) be the last, forever.:::0:::C+
The magic is back:::1:::4/5
It was hard to believe Dreamworks was going to be able to find an interesting enough story for a fourth installment, but Shrek Forever After is actually pretty compelling.:::1:::B-
It coasts a bit, but it's slick, and enough jokes and characters connect that you can't quite dismiss it.:::1:::B-
Can an ogre jump a shark? I think so.:::0:::None
It now requires nothing less than the retroactive destruction of Shreka(TM)s idyllic family life to inject some necessary conflict back into the franchise. If you cana(TM)t fix something that isna(TM)t broke, your only recourse is to break it.:::0:::2.5/4
A recycling machine that recalls the high points of previous installments without demonstrating the need for a new one.:::0:::None
In the fourth and ostensibly final installment, Shrek and company still have some appeal, but the energy is lacking and the fun feels forced.:::0:::2.5/4
Having seen Shrek Forever After only four days ago, it has already begun to slowly fade from memory, whereas the original remains fresh in my mind, as if it were just viewed yesterday. What does that tell you?:::0:::2/4
It's the characters that pull us in when familiarity flatlines our interest.:::1:::2.5/4
After "Shrek" (2001), "Shrek 2" (2004), "Shrek the Third" (2007) and TV's "Shrek the Halls" (2007), you'd think Jeffrey Katzenberg and star Mike Myers would give creator and author William Steig's big ogre a rest.:::0:::C
Let's hope they have the good grace to stick to the promise and really end the franchise here, because no matter what, there's no meat left on this particular ogre's bones.:::0:::None
... that rare sequel that actually tops the original ...:::1:::5/5
After three films aimed squarely at adolescents, I'm mildly surprised to find that DreamWorks has made a final chapter aimed more or less at middle-aged men.:::1:::B
There is no happy ending for the Shrek franchise.:::0:::C-
Shrek Forever After ends (presumably) the Shrek saga on an up note, thanks to a fresh take on a classic plot twist.:::1:::3/4
With the exception of the third film, this is the least funny of the bunch.:::0:::2/4
Shrek Forever After is being billed as the last of four big-screen romps featuring the lovable slime-green ogre with the cheesy Scottish accent. And to see this final installment is to know: It's time.:::0:::2/4
The magic is gone. Like its watermelon-headed hero, Shrek Forever After has the midlife blahs.:::0:::2/4
As It's a Wonderful Life knock-offs go, this one isn't half-bad.:::1:::3/4
For the most part the screenwriters never lose sight of the moral of this story: Whatever else gets tossed into the mix, Shrek must be the heart and soul. In this, Myers is a master; he makes it seem easy being green.:::1:::3/5
All of this would be extremely irritating, and easy to dismiss as cynical manipulation of the moviegoing public -- except for the fact that even recycled Shrek is still pretty funny, and that kids will thoroughly enjoy it.:::1:::2.5/4
The kind of commercially mandated, creatively bankrupt effort that makes you realize why so many animated sequels go straight to DVD.:::0:::2/5
There is a pervasive sense in Shrek 4 that the title character, a onetime antidote to soulless corporate animation, has become what he once detested.:::0:::C
The quick wit and multitiered pop-culture referencing that made the inaugural Shrek so much fun doesn't feel so quick or multi almost a decade down the line.:::0:::2.5/4
Kids' movies are rarely profoundly thoughtful, but there's no reason to be this insulting about it, either.:::0:::C-
This fourth installment demonstrates that the big green ogre has definitely passed his prime...Maybe cinematic ogres age in dog years.:::0:::C
A delightful animated portrait of Shrek's mid-life crisis and his struggle to find a way to savor the ordinary rhythms of marriage and parenting.:::1:::3/5
They've promised us that this will be the last Shrek film, and please let it be true.:::0:::None
The novelty may have worn off, but Shrek Forever After gets better as it goes along, and it has its moments.:::1:::3/5
People will complain about what Shrek Forever After lacks in comparison to the other three installments, but I will take a drastic reduction in fart jokes and bad puns in favor of some heart any day of the week.:::1:::3/5
...as fun and witty as its predecessors, but the movie has a completely different reason for being.:::1:::3/4
The Shrek franchise has officially gone green: Forever After is made from entirely recycled material, and it smells to high heaven.:::0:::1.5/5
By the fourth film the script is defined by one word: desperation. The Shrek team went with the alternate universe/George Bailey trick. But it works. Funnier than Nos. 2 or 3.:::1:::B+
If the screaming kids in the theater don't get to you, then the not-too-jolly green ogre's three burping, farting, and also screaming offspring will...:::0:::1/4
A last dance for the profitable ogre, and while it's a modest affair that barely exerts itself, it's a charming, humorous closer that reunites the viewer with old pals in an extremely agreeable fashion.:::1:::B
[...with the third entry] the franchise went to the well once too often, serving up the bottom's murky remains. Now they've gone twice too often: For most of Shrek Forever After, even the mud seems to have dried out.:::0:::None
Forever After isn't as jumbled and irritating as 2007's Shrek the Third, but it's still decidedly pointless.:::0:::2.5/5
The fourth -- and allegedly final -- installment of the 'Shrek' franchise is an improvementh entry is less about zombie mayhem than about progressing a larger story arc - if anyone still cares.:::0:::2/4
What fun there is to be had is undermined by drab 3D, hacked-out dialogue and rehashed plots.:::0:::2/5
Been there, done that, pass the console.:::0:::2/5
Falls down due to a badly written script, boring zombie-blasting sequences, tedious characters, a complete absence of humour and the lack of anything even remotely resembling a plot.:::0:::1/5
Stupid, over the top but a lot of fun and, once again, ending with the promise of yet another sequel.:::1:::3/5
Strictly for the fans: Mila Jovovich is confident and suitably aggressive, but the fourth chapter (and first in 3D) of the popular franchise is structurally messy and thematically a rehash (with few variations) of the previous segments.:::0:::C-
Instead of engaging us with a good plot, Anderson turns Afterlife into a visual and audio showcase. The film is literally an hour and a half music video jam-packed with uninspired Nine Inch Nails riffs and drumbeats.:::0:::2.5/5
It's boring. It's derivative. It's chaotic. It's a franchise that's been running on fumes for eight years. With this entry, the fuel gauge has finally hit empty.:::0:::1/4
An adaptation which will soon feel decades behind its time.:::0:::1.5/5
A dreadful bore that only occasionally comes to life. Even then, it's still a tedious mess of half-realized ideas, guided by a filmmaker who really shouldn't be allowed to make movies in the first place.:::0:::D
The films always look good and have well-staged action, but they don't have one iota of originality or imagination -- to the extent of virtually recreating key scenes from The Matrix, Die Hard and The Descent.:::0:::2/5
Dead on arrival.:::0:::2/5
Anderson heaves axes, artillery, shattered glass and The Thing-style dogs at the camera to wincing effect, but it still only adds up to a lame, by-the-numbers horror.:::0:::2/5
At this point, I feel pretty darn guilty for ever thinking the original 2002 Resident Evil installment was any type of mindless fun.:::0:::1/4

It captures the essence of selfishness and treachery, all under the guise of creating a system geared toward making it easier for college kids to get laid. And sure enough, in the end, just about everybody gets screwed.:::1:::A
The Social Network is a spellbinding and compelling story with top notch performances and flawless directing.:::1:::10/10
Fincher keeps the movie's tech-y elements on the periphery, focusing instead on the time-honored dramatic elements of isolation, determination, avarice and betrayal.:::1:::A+
The Social Network is splendid entertainment from a master storyteller, packed with energetic incident and surprising performances.:::1:::None
The movie that shows you just what being "the smartest guy in the room" will get you.:::1:::4/4
Aaron Sorkin's amazing script and several great performances make this one of the best movies of 2010.:::1:::5.0/5
The Social Network may not turn out to be the definitive movie made about the plugged-in generation, but it's a pretty good start.:::1:::4/5
Fincher's keen eye for direction and Sorkin's sharp script make this worth seeing for fans and non-fans of [Facebook] alike.:::1:::3/4
Director David Fincher seems drawn to these stories of misguided rebels who become monsters in their attempts to reorder the world.:::1:::A-
Even if you've never touched a computer in your life, you'll find plenty to be fascinated by in this movie, as it shows that, whilst technology may be moving fast, the human capacity for hubris will always remain the same.:::1:::4/5
... A classic American story of capitalism and greed, friendship and betrayal, fueled by envy and lost innocence ...:::1:::A
At last, a movie you can actually discuss afterward. And not just on Facebook or Twitter. No, you'll want to chew it over in person, with friends, for hours.:::1:::None
It's hard work making a character you don't like into a character you don't like, but can still respect.:::1:::4/4
Perhaps we've become a world of Mark Zuckerbergs and it's clear that these filmmakers don't like it one bit.:::1:::None
It's part Citizen Kane, part Goodfellas, part Revenge of the Nerds and the most entertaining film you never knew you would want to see.:::1:::4.5/5
The Social Network is so engrossing you don't even notice how heavy handed the films central dramatic irony could be -- that the greatest tool for communication in the modern age was created by someone who has no idea how to relate to other people.:::1:::9/10
I've read a lot about The Social Network at this point, mostly raves about how it supposedly captures The Way We Live Now, but no one has really zeroed in on how deliberately alienating it is.:::0:::None
You wouldn't think that [Fincher & Sorkin's] talents would gel, yet their collaboration on The Social Network is brilliant ... a gripping tale of ambition and envy, betrayal and resentment.:::1:::None
That the project is not only a success but one of 2010&#8242;s best films is a testament to Fincher's talent as a director and his seemingly perennial ability to surround himself with incredibly astute, like-minded collaborators.:::1:::4.5/5
Almost certainly deliberately indebted to [Citizen] Kane, a quality that wordlessly speaks to Zuckerberg's own inflated ego.:::1:::4.5/5
he Social Network occupies a gray area, in which everybody's perspective is in question, and most of the main characters slip into self-serving, subjective realities. ... an ingenious way to tackle a very curious, contemporary case:::1:::None
There's a real mischievousness to David Fincher's approach.:::1:::B+
Enormously entertaining, thought-provoking and fascinating despite a flawed, possibly biased screenplay.:::1:::9/10
The merits of Facebook can be debated; the merits of The Social Network are undeniable.:::1:::4/4
Directed with typical technical fastidiousness and textural richness by David Fincher from a verbally dexterous script by Aaron Sorkin...:::1:::None

Snappy script, sharp editing, eerily perfect soundtrack and nuanced performances. One of the first films to articulate the psychological power and draw of the internet: what it feeds us and why we feed on it:::1:::4.5/5
Just how much of the story is really true is anyone's guess but the brilliant script and Eisenberg's performance make it worth seeing in any case.:::1:::3.5/5
The need to belong drives the men behind a revolution in the slick biopic The Social Network.:::1:::4/5
The great irony is that the biggest player in the social networking boom proved to be someone so socially retarded he borders on sociopathic at times.:::1:::4/5
I'm really not making this up. My best friend Emily called me half an hour before I left to see 'The Social Network.' And guess what she wanted to know? 'This woman who went to high school with us wants to friend me,' she said. 'Do you remember her?':::1:::3.5/4
Fincher and Sorkin, who clearly acknowledged that the meat of the plot was in examining the diverse characters involved, are to be applauded.:::1:::9/10
The Social Network's portrait of Zuckerberg, replete with the jerky rhythms and constant scanning of the truly net addicted, epitomises that change. For that, and some very fine drama indeed, this film is a must-see.:::1:::None
It's a credit to the combined efforts of Fincher and Sorkin that the dramatic tension can (more than once) culminate in the refreshing of a website.:::1:::3.5/5
This is a beautifully made film by David Fincher with a superb screenplay by Aaron Sorkin.:::1:::4.5/5
Like Zuckerberg, Fincher excels at data management, delivering vast amounts of information with the utmost clarity and speed.:::1:::4/5
This masterful, contentious and gripping biopic downloads us deep inside the control-alt-delete mind of the creator of Facebook, and then throws away the escape key.:::1:::4.5/5
Wherever the truth lies, The Social Network is an innately compelling, beautifully crafted insight into the emergence of a global phenomenon and the disintegration of a rare friendship.:::1:::None
A film of our times that captures the spirit of a generation that isn't prepared to wait their turn or pay their dues and instead will make the opportunities for themselves or tear it away from the less ambitious.:::1:::4/5
This picture helps convey the significance of the social media revolution; the one that simultaneously brings us together and tears us apart. The Social Network is scarily good. It gets us.:::1:::5/5
In a superlative example of art-imitating-life, there was definite alchemy at work on the set of The Social Network...nothing short of a masterpiece.:::1:::None
It's a shamelessly biased account, as well as a seductively plausible one, although you have to keep your wits about you to get the full effect.:::1:::4/5
Fincher has delivered his best work since Seven. An even better period drama than Zodiac and even more relevant to our generation today than Fight Club.:::1:::5/5
Clever, cutting and debateable, The Social Network should inspire discussion -- most likely played out on Facebook -- for months to come.:::1:::None
It doesn't take but a few minutes into the film for us to realize we're not only watching Fincher's strongest film to date, but the year's as well.:::1:::5/5
Fincher has constructed a wonderfully balanced tale of a young narcissistic genius in want of status and recognition.:::1:::4.5/5
There's a lot to like, yet The Social Network lacks a strong emotional core that is integral to making a good drama truly great.:::1:::3.5/5
Not quite a biopic (inventor Zuckerberg is but 26 years old) and not quite a character study, the movie is best thought of as the portrait of an asshole as a young man.:::1:::B+
Ultimately it transcends the online world. This is an age-old story of an ambitious person who is able to accomplish much, but loses sight of what's really important.:::1:::4.5/5
A drama of Shakespearean proportions, with the key protagonists all flawed and found wanting:::1:::None
It's a bit like getting the scoop and the dirt behind the story, as we watch history unfold before our eyes. Filled with megabits of tension, the story flies at a rapid pace:::1:::None
El habil guion de Aaron Sorkin y la dinamica direccion de David Fincher logran un relato entretenido, que ofrece una vision ambigua - aunque piadosa - del creador de Facebook.:::1:::3/5
A riveting, era-defining picture that is guaranteed to make you feel very stupid in comparison and very, very poor.:::1:::None
An exhilarating, absorbing, fast-moving drama detailing the ugly, angry clash of the old world with the new.:::1:::5/5

In his first venture over to the dark side, the central performance by Jesse Eisenberg is a revelation. It's Oscar-worthy stuff.:::1:::3.5/5
An anti-charismatic Charles Foster Kane with social issues, class status anger, and homoerotic panic.:::0:::None
It gets no better than this.:::1:::5/5
The Social Network is technically flawless, powered by Fincher's dazzling direction...:::1:::None
David Fincher's fast-paced business drama adopts the set-up of his 1999 film Fight Club and inverts it.:::1:::4/5
It's still a little early to start making Oscar noise, but I can see "The Social Network" nabbing several come early next year, including nods for Eisenberg and Timberlake.:::1:::4/4
Despite the fun of the parties, the intrigue of the legal wranglings and the humour of the dialogue, Fincher and Sorkin never let us forget that we're complicit in their story (or at least 500 million of us are).:::1:::4/5
Business hasn't been this exciting since Gordon Gekko's first outing.:::1:::4/5
It's riveting stuff...:::1:::5/5
It's Eisenberg's performance that captivates -- icky and icy but strangely sympathetic.:::1:::4/5
Despite all of the betrayal, court cases and double crossing, let's be honest, no-one really cares about the founding of Facebook, but in the hands of David Fincher, however, The Social Network is something of a masterpiece.:::1:::5/5
While it does not really live up to the hyperbolic reviews, this is still a fascinating look at the craft of computer programming and the ostensibly boring question of intellectual property. Of course, it helps that the script is more fiction than fact.:::1:::None
El boton de "Me gusta" ha sido presionado. Muchas veces, y con fuerza.:::1:::4/5
The story of Facebook is given a dramatic twist by the combination of Sorkin's brainy script and Fincher's brawny direction. What emerges is the tale of a computer nerd who only understands relationships if they're online.:::1:::4/5
A rich, understated character drama that gleefully exposes the petty playground politics at the centre of one of the internet-era's most bitter court cases.:::1:::4/5
A rare and vital film that nails the concerns of privileged post-adolescence in the first few years of the 21st century, and, more universally, draws out eternal themes of truth, subjectivity and envy with an effortless elegance.:::1:::5/5
A timeless story of friendship and betrayal which illustrates how our appetite for more can become insatiable, regardless of the consequences.:::1:::5/5
Fincher melds The Social Network into a riveting study on the perils of power and money, flipping Zuckerberg from socially-maladjusted college student into a young man governed by obsession, greed and entitlement.:::1:::5/5
The film is almost nothing but scenes of people sitting over glowing screens, or in lawyers' offices, or in bars/diners/clubs. Yet it never seems sedentary. The jabber is intensive.:::1:::4/5

Polish up the Oscar and get ready to give it to Eisenberg, an actor whom most people have never seen before.:::1:::4/4
Put it in a double bill with Zodiac and I might just cry myself to sleep with amazing.:::1:::None
Brilliantly directed, superbly written and impeccably acted, this is a hugely enjoyable, era-defining drama that's gripping, laugh-out-loud funny and ultimately moving -- it's also one of the best films of the year.:::1:::5/5
The film is...kind of like a portrait of Now.:::1:::4.5/5
Tells an impressive story in an accomplished way about genius and intellect, the corrupting power of greed and pride, and about paying for poor behavior, intentional or otherwise.:::1:::4.5/5

You?ll be watching in awe as Fincher weaves the scenes of this film together. There?s never a dull moment.:::1:::A
Fincher and Sorkin Have Created a Film Whose Truth is as Subject as it's Presented on Facebook Itself. A Dark, Entertaining Parable.:::1:::4/5
A sympathetic examination of how this prickly character [Zuckerberg], and his desperate need for connection, led to an invention that allows millions to connect with each other.:::1:::4/4
We have Facebook because some dude got dumped. I can believe that.:::1:::4.8/5
A dizzyingly smart, confident, often riveting drama about the creation of the groundbreaking Web site.:::1:::None
The Social Network may bore into its subject, rather than blow it up, but it has inviting style and depth. It's an adroit portrait of a revolutionary time that emboldened contact at the same time that it made it less meaningful.:::1:::3.5/5
Interesting, if unexceptional, but there are bothersome portrayals in the film that just don't ring true. It turns out the there is a good reason for this: these depictions are false. That is a problem.:::1:::B
Watching a movie with a snappy pace, whip-smart dialogue, and so many interesting things to say about where we are as a country right now is such a pleasure.:::1:::4/4
"The Social Network" has an unusually difficult task to pull off--it has to make computer programming exciting--and it does so with aplomb.:::1:::A
Manipulation is the heart of this film, both in the story being told, and by the filmmakers who molded the true story to fit their agenda.:::0:::2/4
a virtuoso modern parable about greed, innovation, and betrayal, as well as a compelling portrait of how technology is changing the landscape of both business enterprise and interpersonal relationships:::1:::3.5/4
Here?s a status update: Yes, controlling personalities with Napoleon complexes thrive on the Internet. Too bad this film seems to have been made by as well as about them.:::1:::6/10
The Social Network is a sweeping look at the mind, our generation and era, and our future.:::1:::92/100
A glib little morality tale dressed up in trendy togs, and it is to profundity what Facebook is to actual human interaction. But it?s undeniably appealing.:::1:::4/5
The film's real achievement stretches beyond the story. When we've all forgotten Facebook, The Social Network will remind us what it was to be part of the generation of Millenials.:::1:::3.5/4
Expresses that the most successful personalities are driven by a psychotic need to win.:::1:::10/10
The underlying message in the films seems to be that if these guys just got laid more often we would never have had innovations like Napster and Facebook.:::1:::None

'Citizen Kane' for the impatient digital era, with that masterpiece's decades-spanning morality tale of loss, hubris, loneliness and revenge compressed into a few years, and with an ex-girlfriend named Erica instead of a sled named Rosebud...:::1:::4/4
The film played well for me while it was playing -- I wasn't bored. But it's far from the best movie I've seen this year.:::1:::3/5
The movie's lustrous, deep-focus frames and headlong pace are difficult to resist. Its an entertainingly cynical small movie.:::1:::None
Cool, fast, smart and sleek. It's also a surprisingly deep and almost painful reminder of the importance of a real social network - as opposed to, say, Facebook.:::1:::3.5/4
Bookmark this one on your must-see list.:::1:::5/5
The Facebook flick is a kick-in-the-head tale of ambition, friendship and betrayal. Fincher and Sorkin turn hacking, blogging and coding into action scenes.:::1:::A
I know I could tell you to 'accept' or 'like' or 'friend' this movie. Instead, I'm just going to tell you to go see it.:::1:::8/10
Fast-moving, engaging, and even exciting.:::1:::4/5
Even if you've never logged on to Facebook, you can still get caught up in the way The Social Network looks at issues of friendship, rivalry, inspiration, and the cutthroat nature of business.:::1:::4/4
A modern morality tale full of rich performances by a great young cast playing from a smart, canny script. The Social Network is one of the coolest, sharpest films of the year.:::1:::4/5
Makes a seemingly dry civil law suit story a fascinating sexy watch.:::1:::A-
Like the screwball comedies and film noir staples of yore, The Social Network exhibits an extraordinary gift for gab.:::1:::3.5/4
Young adults in today's Entitlement Generation may come away from the film thinking that it's perfectly justifiable to be an a**hole and a misogynist, as long as you get into Harvard and come out a billionaire.:::1:::B
[Network's rise and fall] relates to the classic gangster film narrative ... More directly, [the film] positions itself as a new Citizen Kane, with its protagonist reaching the heights of a communication empire.:::1:::8.5/10
The Social Network boasts enough great dialogue to fuel a half dozen Oscar-bait movies.:::1:::3.5/4
What happens when a director and writer hate their subject? A well made, but one dimensional hit piece.:::0:::C
Never before have coding and algorithms been so titillating.:::1:::None

The movie may serve to bridge the huge Grand Canyon-like chasm between baby boomers on one side and Gen X and Y'ers on the other, stimulating meaningful discussions about values, viewpoints and ideas.:::1:::3/4
Give it a shot. Unlike Facebook itself, The Social Network has no real flaws.:::1:::5/5
As great as the film is, you can't overlook the fact that if you knew these people in real life you would block them on Facebook.:::1:::4 out of 5 stars
The Social Network is one of the saddest movies ever made:::1:::None

a self-important, narcissistic glorification of its own significance:::0:::2.5/5
The chill that seeps through The Social Network... is a feature, not a bug: Zuckerberg's is a cold world, and Eisenberg's calculated detachment makes for an astonishingly sophisticated performance...:::1:::None
The cinematic union of Sorkin and Fincher for this their first collaboration is brilliant.:::1:::None
The story of a groundswell,of an unlikely collaboration between a product and its customers that upended not just the value propositions of Harvard, but of the pre-web economy:::1:::A+
... it's flashy as hell given its subject matter. It also doesn't hurt that it's pretty good.:::1:::None
... it's Eisenberg's performance that helps make Zuckerberg the most fascinating and complicated movie character since Daniel Day-Lewis' Daniel Plainview.:::1:::5/5
Fincher is back to the sort of engrossing, immersive storytelling of his best work in Zodiac.:::1:::9.5/10
Nonetheless, having made the occupants of the White House seem believably human in The American President and in The West Wing, Sorkin knows it's better to focus on his characters' hearts, no matter how black, than their coding fingers:::1:::5/5
There's a lot to "Like" about The Social Network.:::1:::3.5/4
That is, the possible "openness" of Facebook here hinges on the definitive closed system embodied by this fictional Mark Zuckerberg.:::1:::None
In the end, The Social Network is not so much about Facebook as it is about the complicated and tortuous social warfare that led to its birth.:::1:::4/5
You will know The Social Network is something very special from its first scene.:::1:::4/4
The Social Network shares creative DNA with a handful of classic, zeitgeist-savvy films like Network and All the President's Men, as well as more recent fare such as The Insider and Michael Clayton.:::1:::4/4
The brilliance of Eisenberg's performance is that even when you want to slap his Zuckerberg silly you can't help but admire his creativity, his ambition and his almost religious dedication to the Internet's potential.:::1:::3.5/4
This is the 2010 Oscar season's first drama to live up to the hype and expectations associated with it.:::1:::3.5/4
There's a cool precision and honesty to The Social Network, the story of the founding of Facebook, which guarantees its entertainment value even as it limits its emotional impact.:::1:::B
It has the staccato wit of a drawing-room comedy, the fatal flaw of a tragic romance and the buzzy immediacy of a front-page headline, all powered by a kinetic engine typically found in an action flick.:::1:::3.5/4
[P]roof that Fincher's directorial verve can imbue virtually any tale with urgency, be it the search for a killer or the search for a killer app.:::1:::None
Despite the whiz-bang topicality, the headlong intelligence, and the many sharp collegiate scenes, this new-style movie hews pretty closely to an old-style playbook.:::1:::B+
David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin have put together a well-acted, intelligent, and compelling film that merits accolades as one of the best films of 2010.:::1:::3.5/4
The Social Network is a bland title for such a thrilling, ballsy, intelligent movie.:::1:::None
Hallelujah! Finally, a movie with the kind of dialogue we deserve!:::1:::None
Much of the preliminary discussions about logarithms and formulas are merely geek-speak for most moviegoers, but because Fincher has weaved it all together in a hugely entertaining package, we don't care.:::1:::None
Multifaceted and Brilliant:::1:::5/5
Eisenberg gives us a speeded-up rendition of his previous performances, but it fits. There's also fine cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth and softly pulsating music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.:::1:::4/4
What a joy to sit in a theater and be engaged, surprised, challenged, amused.:::1:::None
Fantastic performances, compelling story for teens and up.:::1:::4/5
A perfect package to document a bright young thing's meteoric rise and near-fall.:::1:::None
The Social Network is more a meditation on right vs. wrong than a chronicle of the birth of Facebook and it is a more affecting film because of that.:::1:::5/5
Easily ranks as one of the best films of 2010, and David Fincher's best work this side of Fight Club and Se7en.:::1:::4/4
An utterly fascinating and compelling work that combines classical dramatic storytelling, a cutting-edge visual style and a steely intelligence equal to that displayed by any of its hyper-brainy characters:::1:::None
...a fabulous post-modern fable.:::1:::4.5/5
David Fincher's smartly written, expertly told chronicling of the dawn of the Facebook era ... is just that compelling, that engrossing, that hard to resist. Kind of like a certain website I know.:::1:::4/4
The best movie ever made about e-commerce, as well as the Internet itself.:::1:::5/5
A tale of a social outcast turning the tables, or, if you can't join 'em, beat 'em. This is a valuable, flinty work of reflective zeitgeist, holding up a myriad of mirrors to our own wildly self-promotional selves.:::1:::8/10
Every aspect of the film, from Fincher's beautiful direction to Reznor's emotionally devastating score to each and every performance is absolutely stunning.:::1:::5/5
None of these ideas is revolutionary, but The Social Network embeds them in a taut, intellectually exhilarating narrative in which daredevil dialogue simultaneously defines characters and obscures motivations.:::1:::A-
One of the best of 2010. (Parental Review also Available):::1:::None
Forget the guy who invented the Pet Rock or Jump to Conclusions Mat; Facebook is now the stick that every American dream is measured against. And "The Social Network" is surprisingly the stick that movies need to measure up to in 2010.:::1:::3.5/4
...an exciting parable about new millennium high tech, money and power.:::1:::A
Somehow the results come together like the perfect status update.:::1:::4.5/5
Sorkin has stripped down the Facebook experience and presents the overlying and often unspoken commitment to its usage. How do others view us?:::1:::4/4
If you want to see an enthralling movie about business in the 21st century, forget about that stinker Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.:::1:::4/4
Everyone in The Social Network is smart. Everyone in The Social Network is sarcastic. And that is big fun to watch.:::1:::3.5/4
David Fincher-who managed to make information-overload so gripping in Zodiac-is the ideal director for this story: He sweeps you up into its unexpectedly vibrant world.:::1:::None

Everyone involved went out and made the film they were trying to make, and it's often funny and generally captivating.:::1:::A-
You wouldn't think a movie about the creation of a website could be so enthralling, insightful, funny, and complex, but here we are.:::1:::A-
The best aspect of the movie is just how delightfully trashy it is. There are more "oh no he di-in't" moments than in an episode of Jersey Shore.:::1:::4/4
The Social Network" is sharp, incisive, insightful and witty. It also touches upon our need -- some may say our addiction -- for human contact, even if it is through a computer.:::1:::4/4
Lackluster, pedestrian, emotionally hollow and underwhelming despite exquisite cinematography and a timely, initially intriguing premise.:::0:::5.49/10
The Social Network sets out to show you the genesis of a modern Rockefeller, Carnegie or Vanderbilt. In the 21st century, information is the new oil, the new steel. What hasn't changed is the mentality of the tycoon.:::1:::10/10
Fincher's approach to the socially significant creation that validated the lonely lives of a nation is to shoot it like he made Fight Club, a surreal dream of financial waste and delusion covered in a deep green and brown color scheme.:::1:::None
Eisenberg is superb, playing not the real Mark Zuckerberg but the character created by Sorkin, hyper-alert and obtuse, his voice both taut and tremulous.:::1:::A-
All of these misshapen odds and ends click together for one of the year's most satisfying films so far.:::1:::3.5/4
Aiming for greatness and not quite making it, The Social Network will have to settle for solidly consistent. Most major studio releases should be so lucky.:::1:::3/4
You may not want to live inside Mark Zuckerberg's head, you may not care for Facebook, but you'll be drawn into the world of the film utterly. It's a massive achievement.:::1:::A
Densely written and expertly directed with performances that rank among the year's best...:::1:::4/5
Even with his constantly affectless expression, Eisenberg gives Zuckerberg just enough vulnerability to make you not entirely hate him.:::1:::3/4
The writing is strong, and the drama -- the drama of betrayal -- is ever present.:::1:::4/4
The Social Network is a film for now, even if in the realm of computer time 2003 seems like a lifetime ago. It's riveting entertainment, and a must-see.:::1:::A
A fly-on-the-wall objective look at a personality who is at once public and unknowable, in metaphor for current instantaneous non-face-to-face madness.:::1:::None
This account of Facebook's founder, and of the website's explosive growth, quickly lifts you to a state of exhilaration, and pretty much keeps you there for two hours.:::1:::None
Relies mainly on great dialogue and strong performances from its young cast to propel a story so riveting that it transcends the film's ugly reputation as The Facebook Movie.:::1:::4.5/5
It's ironic that only a week after Oliver Stone's Wall Street sequel came out, The Social Network schools the old man by absolutely nailing the new generation of rich jerkwads:::1:::A-
Thanks to David Fincher's straightforward direction, Aaron Sorkin's Oscar-level script and a half-dozen sharp performances, this is one of the best movies of the year.:::1:::5/5
It's strange to have a film have so much magic within and yet ultimately not have enough of the right kind of magic to make it work.:::0:::2.5/4
drawing a line of lack-of-inspiration true and dire directly to Renny Harlin's already-completely-forgotten The Covenant.:::0:::1/4
As an object to look at and be zoomed along in like an amusement park ride -- which is all it's meant to be -- this movie is pretty much more of the summery same.:::0:::2/5
It also looks quite nice with some well-designed adventure moments and clean camera work that's flashy but usually elegant. But that's a few islands of interest on a sea of interchangeable marketing parts that's all sizzle and no substance.:::0:::5/10
Whether intentional or not, The Sorcerer's Apprentice plays like Disney's stalled attempt to launch a stripped down Harry Potter-like franchise.:::0:::C
The Sorcerer's Apprentice is one of those films that feels very close to being good.:::0:::2/5
Frankly, it's completely dorky. And yet it slips by because of its wise decision to fully embrace that dorkiness.:::1:::6/10
Light on logic, and not always polished, the film plays like a gonzo big-budget Roger Corman B-movie. It's filled with wonderfully imaginative visuals, interesting characters and spectacle galore.:::1:::7/10
This PG-rated Jerry Bruckheimer production is slick as an oiled weasel: larded with fancy special effects, canned romance, corny humor and a general lack of sophistication. [Blu-ray]:::0:::2/4
...a disappointingly repetitive and flat-out dull piece of work...:::0:::2/4
The Sorcerer's Apprentice is a great family film that packs PG-13 excitement into a PG-rated film.:::1:::7/10
Though the movie is magic-like rather than magical and is, to be honest, on the thin side, it cast enough of a spell to keep me entertained.:::1:::None
It is the exact kind of film you would imagine to be spun-off from a dialogue-free animated sequence from Fantasia; that is to say, not a very complex or interesting one.:::0:::2.5/5
The Sorcerer's Apprentice is what you get when Jerry Bruckheimer produces Harry Potter.:::1:::3/5
This slice of science and sorcery feels like a throwback to the 1980s heyday of family films.:::1:::3/5
In spite of Nic Cage's 'Hobo-with-a-leather-fetish' chic there are some inventive effects sequences. Feels likes like a watchable-but-unremarkable patchwork quilt of every fantasy flick ever made.:::1:::3/5
Cage's expressions cover a limited range, from earnest to fearless to glazed, and he trots out leaden dialogue along the lines of, "That... must...not... happen!" Surely there can't be an easier way to earn $20 million or so.:::0:::2/5
The plot verges on incoherence, but The Sorcerer's Apprentice is entertaining enough if you can forgive the presence of Cage, whose brand of glum camp hasn't grown any fresher with the years.:::0:::2.5/5
Probably would have saved us all a lot of trouble if someone had have pointed the way to Hogwarts.:::0:::2/5
I must say that the development of CGI special effects has contributed to the death of character and story. And that's true in this case.:::0:::2.5/5
Cage and Baruchel fail to generate a connection and, apart from Molina's Oscar Wilde impersonation, there isn't much to laugh at -- or thrill to, for that matter, since the action has been choreographed with the nerveless competence of an arcade game.:::0:::2.5/5
While containing a handful of impressive action sequences, this film is let down by a contrived premise and by-the-numbers script.:::0:::None
The wit and charm are missing:::0:::None
"Almost" and "wants to be" should never precede the word "epic" ... (feels like) the coolest stuff is being saved for later (sequels.):::0:::2.0/4.0
The Sorcerer's Apprentice is essentially what would happen if The Mummy took a wrong turn at Hogwarts and ended up at a Dungeons and Dragons convention.:::0:::2/5
The non-stop action almost drowns out what might have been a decent screenplay...:::0:::2/5
It's an enjoyable action-fantasy adventure with a sparky script; there's even a playful pastiche of the broomsticks-coming-alive scene from the original legend, using the famous Paul Dukas music.:::1:::3/5
No one is likely to mistake it for art, but this is one of the better summer blockbusters, thanks to special effects, adequate acting and welcome flashes of wit.:::1:::3/5
If you're a kid whose summer holidays are starting to drag, this should kill a couple of hours. Just do your folks a favour and don't make them come along.:::1:::3/5
For my next trick, I will make the sequel disappear!:::0:::2/5
Promises tongue-in-cheek thrills but doesn't quite deliver.:::0:::None
No amount of fireballs or car chases are able to stop the whole thing being really boring.:::0:::2/5
Despite Cage in a snit, it's a likable if functional summer-show.:::1:::3/5
Casts a superficial and short-lived spell.:::0:::2/5
Cage is as wacky as ever and Baruchel is a likeable goof, though Molina is wasted and not quite evil enough.:::1:::3/5
Trademark Jerry Bruckheimer entertainment, hurtling along at a brisk pace and having just about enough comedy, romance and adventure to keep everyone satisfied.:::1:::3/5
Fun for 20 minutes, remorseless thereafter...:::0:::2/5
A perfectly decent family romp boosted by the occasional flash of something braver and better.:::1:::3/5
Wand-erful stuff.:::1:::3/5
I wouldn't exactly recommend it, but let's just say you could certainly do worse.:::0:::None
Likeable, engaging fantasy adventure with a decent script, pacey direction, terrific special effects and strong performances...:::1:::3/5
As a contemporary fantasy, it is more holiday filler than summer magic, but the cast does its best to bring all the cliches to life.:::0:::None
If they had just let a little more anarchy in, this could really have been a piece of cinematic magic... still, it's enjoyable, doesn't outstay its welcome and there's always a chance they might take it up a notch when it comes to the inevitable sequel.:::1:::3/5
A loud, wacky, effects-laden extravaganza that's short on plot, characterisations and any real tension. But it's also rather mindless good fun.:::1:::3/5
A barrage of spectacular special effects in search of an appealing story.:::1:::3/5
The skills of Master Nicolas Cage are strong, but they cannot save The Sorcerer's Apprentice.:::0:::2.5/5
No magic here.:::0:::2/4
There is exactly one element of the film that's of any use whatsoever: Nicolas Cage is absolutely on fire, bringing 1000% to a role that does not require, justify, or reward such effort.:::0:::4/10
Obvious, oblivious to logic and overblown, but it also reminds us that escapist nonsense can be fun...:::1:::2.5/4
Nicolas Cage is a hoot to watch even though he phones in his performance almost as much as he did for Ghost Rider.:::1:::3/5
It shows a fair amount of visual imagination, a brisk pace, solid acting, and lots of action, but is lacking in imagination when it comes to story and dialogue.:::1:::C+
Because the story has been around for so long, it's easy to forgive director Jon Turtletaub for having difficulty finding a fresh take on it.:::0:::3/5
"The Sorcerer's Apprentice" is more frustrating than it is bad--there's a lot of potential here, and if the writing had been more inspired, this could have been a strong comeback for both Cage and for Disney.:::0:::C
'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' is not magical. It isn't humdrum, either.:::0:::2.5/4
An entertaining origin story; some truly neat special effects played against the very real streets of New York City makes The Sorcerer's Apprentice that much more magical and lots of fun to see on the big screen.:::1:::3/5
The plot wanders here and there but the appeal of Cage and especially Baruchel makes the film entertaining overall.:::1:::6/10
Is any of it memorable? Hardly. I remember the contours of my theater seat better than I recall the particulars of this cinematic sleight of hand.:::0:::2/4
Nicholas Cage is fun, but the rest of the movie lacks vision, style and dare I say it - magic.:::0:::C
He cana(TM)t hold a candle to Mickey.:::0:::c
There is much that's appealing, from the performances to the scene where Turteltaub re-creates a live-action version of the classic scene from Disney's Fantasia.:::1:::3.5/5
This loud, disjointed concept is one of the summer's major disappointments.:::0:::5/10
In contrast to some of his recent outings, Cage, who strides manfully through the film in a floor-length cowhide coat and who looks like the victim of the bad-hair curse, is restrained and often charming as the supernatural-paternal adult.:::1:::B
With a wave of the hand, characters conjure stuff out of thin air, move objects and sizzle with lightning. You know, normal movie magic stuff.:::1:::4/5
The Sorcerer's Apprentice is the product of a bad script, lifeless acting and predictable action. Jay Baruchel has already played this character two times this year.:::0:::2/5
As Balthazar, Cage doesn't disappoint. He's just manic enough to keep the character from becoming too predictable. More's the pity, then, that a pro like him has to cede so much screen time to his character's young protege.:::0:::1.5/4
[It's] what ought to be the baseline for summer movies: fast, funny, entertaining, perfect for beating the heat.:::1:::3/5
This sorcerer's biggest trick will be making the audience disappear.:::0:::None
Alfred Molina's award-quality performance and the special effects aren't enough to keep this from causing a lot of squirming.:::0:::6/10
The Sorcerer's Apprentice should be rated U for Untouched by Human Hands.:::0:::1/4
It's a producer Jerry Bruckheimer picture, so did you think for even a NYC sec it would be good?:::0:::C
Good, solid entertainment jam packed with creativity.:::1:::None
[The] callback to the animated short...you're working on plasma balls and fire and stuff and suddenly it's 'Substitutiary Locomotion.' And it doesn't work.:::1:::3/5
Ever wonder what the Harry Potter films would be like without an ounce of wit, grace or subtlety? Wonder no more.:::0:::2/4
A big gob of mythical makeover and special effects-freewheeling fun.:::1:::B
It's a fairly fun time for families, and Hollywood can -- and continually does -- build franchises out of far worse concoctions than this.:::1:::None
It's just good enough to be considered "good enough.":::1:::B-
With a predictable plot, by-the-numbers action-movie jolts and no real sense of wonder, The Sorcerer's Apprentice is really just a pumpkin.:::0:::2/4
Once the filmmakers have dispensed with a grueling expository preface set in Arthurian England, this shameless Harry Potter knockoff is a pretty tasty bucket of popcorn.:::1:::None
On a hot summer day, a family trip to the movies can be a time-filler or a time-waster. Apprentice honorably fits the second category.:::0:::None
The idea floating behind The Sorcerer's Apprentice, and it's a marvelous one, is that in the city, magic is both everywhere you look and everywhere you don't look.:::1:::None
If a couple of adults are looking for mature movie enjoyment, this can be a disappointing recipe. But if you want a fun, fast-paced film that can be enjoyed by all ages, it cooks up just right.:::1:::3/4
Turtletaub has already proven he can avoid logic spectacularly well in the National Treasure films and he does it again here as well. It isn't a bad thing.:::1:::None
I get a charge out of Cage's serious self-mockery, here as a wizard who'd never make the grade at Hogwarts in a fantasy that doesn't aim high but hits the mark for summer entertainment.:::1:::2.5/4
The story, not to mention Cage's hair, is a little murky (can't a sorcerer conjure up a little shampoo?), but it doesn't matter: The fun here is in the action.:::1:::2.5/4
Nicolas Cage and his magical perm conjure little more than bland theatrics in this formulaic fantasy flick.:::0:::2/5
click to read the full review:::0:::2.5/5
As expected, the CGI effects are over-the-top (and there's always a so-what quality to such "exciting" scenes), but the movie is light-handed and exhilarating...:::1:::4/5
While Mr. Molina and Mr. Cage supply a measure of well-compensated eccentricity, their labors ultimately serve to emphasize the grinding mediocrity of the enterprise.:::0:::2/5
The movie isn't so much bad as it is formulaic and uninspired. In some ways, that might almost be a worse sin.:::0:::2/4
A generally joyless pastiche of sorcery history, imitation Potter "chosen one" Messianics and mirthless silliness, it's another in a string of recent black marks against Cage's Oscar-owning reputation.:::0:::1.5/4
Magic is the one thing in very short supply in this modern-day sorcery tale.:::0:::1.5/5
The Sorcerer's Apprentice is not really about storytelling as much as it is about marketing. It's not about "what happens next" as it is "how much stuff can we cram in there, and how well can we sell it?":::0:::None
A film obsessed with the idea of magic that doesn't bother to stop and create any of its own.:::0:::None
A brain-dead blockbuster high on action sequences, CGI and silliness, but low on fun, thrills and imagination. Where's the magic when you really need it the most?:::0:::4.22/10
The Sorcerer's Apprentice is visually sustaining and surprisingly entertaining.:::1:::B
Just another loud, pointless Jerry Bruckheimer production, with Cage smirking his way through perfunctory action sequences.:::0:::2/5
The Sorcerer's Apprentice has its fun moments, but they are lost amidst all the lousy CGI clutter and noisy filler scenes of people hurling blue balls of energy at each other to little effect.:::0:::2.5/5
Offers enough endearing goofiness and magic of its own to earn a pass this time.:::1:::3/5
a turbo-charged, entertain-at-all-costs movie:::1:::3.5/5
The movie proceeds exactly as you'd expect, only longer and with much less insanity than you'd expect from Cage.:::0:::2.5/5
A breezy bit of summertime family entertainment.:::1:::2.5/4
The Sorcerer's Apprentice is too long, and it's ersatz magic, but at least it casts an ersatz spell.:::1:::B-
[L]o and behold and WTF, here's adorkable Jay Baruchel... getting molested by dancing mops as... the literal replication of a 70-year-old cartoon... force[s] its way into a movie where it clashes tonally, interrupts the plot, and just plain makes no sense:::0:::None
Kid-friendly thriller is fun, if lacking in real magic.:::1:::3/5
Although Turtletaub could have toned down a couple of the many battle sequences this should be spellbinding summer fun for its primary family and kid target audience.:::1:::3/5
(F)ireballs and lightning bolts that wouldn't be out of place in an old Ghostbusters flick. There's even a bit of nostalgic charm in that. Then Turteltaub breaks out the dancing brooms and we remember Disney's misguided money grab that got us here.:::0:::C+
Though formulaic and aimed squarely at the twelve-year-old set, it manages to put together a decently entertaining two hours, thanks in large part to its lead performers.:::1:::B-
The Sorcerer's Apprentice conjures plenty of FX but too little magic.:::0:::2.5/4
Not even the loose cannon of Nicolas Cage shooting plasma balls, riding a Chrysler Building griffin, explaining string theory or wearing a ridiculous hat can stiffen this wet noodle.:::0:::C
Too much eye candy and not enough heart has this bit of blockbuster bait fizzling into frustrating forgettability after its promising, and at times dazzling, start.:::1:::2.5/4
Like all great kid flicks, it's too good %u2013 too fast and too funny %u2013 to be confined within the "family film" ghetto.:::1:::4/5
I almost want to recommend the movie anyway for the sheer lunacy that Nicolas Cage [and Jay Baruchel] bring to it.:::0:::2.5/4
For all the spellcasting, there's very little magic in this movie.:::0:::2/4
The title character in The Sorcerer's Apprentice is played by Jay Baruchel, and here things begin to go seriously astray. They don't ever stop.:::0:::1/4
Turteltaub has a workmanlike touch and an easy sense of humor here, and he and his team do a better-than-expected job of keeping you interested in the story, despite it being yet another Tale of a Reluctant Young Man With A Supernatural Hero's Calling.:::1:::B-
It's an OK, family-oriented comedy action blockbuster with jokes and special effects troweled on to bolster its not-terribly-fresh story of magic and mentoring.:::1:::3/4
In place of a plot, there's a premise; in place of carefully crafted action, there are stupefying exercises in computer-generated imagery, and in place of an ending, there's a hook for the sequel and, if all goes well, a new franchise.:::0:::2.5/4
The story takes a little too long to tell, the special effects take precedence over the plot and the climax is as predictable as the hefty box office the film is likely to amass.:::0:::2/4
That there are more misses than hits will matter only if you're above the legal age to drive.:::1:::3/5
You can't fault the film's classy cast or its genial humor or its speedy-but-comprehensible action sequences, which beautifully straddle the line between "breakneck excitement" and "what the what was that?":::1:::2.5/4
Baruchel, fresh from his first starring role in She's Out of My League, establishes again that he can hold his ground as a lead actor, even when competing with Cage.:::1:::2.5/4
The disjointed plot is a melange of cliches with logic that feels conjured up on the spot. Magical legends are cobbled together as if by someone in Screenwriting 101. Or, as is the case here, by a half dozen writers, seemingly at cross purposes.:::0:::1.5/4
More Cheez Whiz than wizardly.:::0:::2/4
Another summer effects extravaganza that fails to replace charm with CGI, though at least it spares us the agony of crummy 3-D.:::0:::C
This seventh teaming between Bruckheimer and Cage is as close to cine-magic as they've come. A Merlin tip-of-the-wizard-cone-hat to one of the most bewitching blasts of the summer.:::1:::8/10
The filmmakers have called up--and pumped up--an absolute orgy of special effects, but all they've conjured is a horrid mess of a movie.:::0:::D
It doesn't have a script that draws us in, or characters we care about. It's a mere jumble of special effects, hoping to catch kids searching for a quick summer substitute for Harry Potter.:::0:::2/4
Against many odds, a big-budget Jerry Bruckheimer remake -- of a story best known with Mickey Mouse in the lead! -- manages to hit every mark and gives us a rare blockbuster that should please viewers of all types.:::1:::B+
Successful tales of the high seas are one thing. The Sorcerer's Apprentice proves that when it comes to reinventing the corporate catalog, the House of Mouse is more a House of Lousy Movies.:::0:::1.5/5
When judged on its own merits, this action-fantasy is actually one of the more fun movies to come along this summer. It has a good combination of thrills and laughs.:::1:::3/4
A movie in which spells are cast is not the same as a movie that casts a spell.:::0:::2/4
Strangely like 1985's Young Sherlock Holmes, another film about name-checking familiar fictional characters and eagerly hopping from one amiably overblown, often clunky special-effects setpiece to the next.:::0:::C-
Cage and Molina add magic, but not enough.:::0:::2/4
How is it possible that a film that spends so much time talking about magic can itself possess so little of it?:::0:::1/5
There's a lot of money onscreen in Jerry Bruckheimer's latest family-friendly blockbuster, but it can't hide the two-bit story and script.:::0:::None
It whizzes by more quickly than you can say "Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer," while also being magically devoid of anything resembling character, originality or distinction.:::0:::2/5
Funny, that despite non-stop special effects, sorcery and such, The Sorcerer's Apprentice can't quite overcome the key ingredient it lacks: magic.:::0:::2.5/5
Gets right almost everything that Prince of Persia got wrong.:::1:::B
The many-hands script -- last one in was Matt Lopez of Bedtime Stories -- exists largely to show Cage and Baruchel and Molina shooting fire-jets and balls of compressed energy at one another's heads.:::0:::2.5/4
It does feature people waving their arms around while CGI happens. So it's got that going for it. Which is nice.:::1:::None
We witness a dumbing down of The Sorcerer's Apprentice as director Turteltaub and team seem to be fulfilling some quota of silliness:::0:::1.5/4
The sense of warm and fuzzy wonder that starts things off doesn't stand a chance against the uneven, badly t over the third, but it won't make us clamor for a fifth.:::1:::3/5
Everyone involved fulfills his or her job requirements adequately. But the magic is gone, and Shrek Forever After is no longer an ogre phenomenon to reckon with. Instead, it's a Hot Swamp Time Machine.:::1:::B-
Dreamworks seems bored with the ogre who laid the golden egg.:::0:::2/4
Shrek the Third made more than $322 million. Why kill the goose that laid the golden egg? Because it's time.:::0:::2.5/5
A surprising revival after Shrek the Third was so lifeless. This is billed as the final chapter in the big guy's saga and, unexpectedly, I'm now sorry to see him go.:::1:::B+
Third times are rarely charms in the movies, much less fourth go-rounds, and it takes more than ho-hum 3-D and video-game-ready action sequences to liven up diminishing returns.:::0:::2/5
It takes the film a deadly long time to kick in, and when it does, it largely retreads formula: ironic use of pop standards, musical numbers with contemporary choreography played for maximum laughs, risque one-liners.:::0:::None
This fourth and allegedly final installment in the series is lifeless, joyless and woefully devoid of the upbeat energy that distinguished the earlier movies -- well, at least the first two.:::0:::None
The first summer movie thus far to deliver on its promise to put on a good show.:::1:::3/4
Happily, it's a move that revives our aging ogre, and renews his flagging franchise.:::1:::4/5
Funnier and more exciting - and more emotionally connected - than most of the summer's blockbusters so far.:::1:::None
Shrek Forever After is, easily, the best sequel in the series.:::1:::None
You can see the ending, and even the fantastically corny final line coming the whole time, but when they finally do they still hit hard.:::1:::3.5/4
Shrek Forever After isn't offensive, just innocuous and unnecessary, a supposed final chapter to a series that should have ended two installments ago.:::0:::2/4
Shrek Matures: Bourgeoisie Critics are Opposed:::1:::B
Shrek is without question the funniest film of the year-at least so far.:::1:::4.5/5
Old-fashioned, despite the 3D, this fourth (and final?) segment in the hit animated franchise is the weakest in terms of wit, playfulness, entertainment.:::0:::C
Good enough for the kiddies, but grown-ups may find Part 4 little more than a hollow echo of the original Shrek.:::0:::2.5/5
This fourth installment in the popular animated franchise demonstrates it may finally be time to let Shrek and Fiona live happily ever after.:::0:::None
Whether or not Shrek has outlived his usefulness as a profit center, it's clear that time and technology have passed him by.:::0:::None
:::0:::None
Displays atypical laziness and tone-deaf direction for a feature concerning the electric boogaloo secrets of the underprivileged.:::0:::D
Even if the picture breaks no new ground, the verve of the actors and their fancy footwork is half the battle.:::0:::2/4
Cliched dance movie with some fun moves.:::1:::3/5
The dance numbers are high octane, and the characters are likable enough to make us want to hang with them through a plot we've seen so many times before it's like movie muscle memory takes over.:::0:::6/10
Predictable dance melodrama with little to recommend it.:::0:::1/5
For the movie--and audiences--the good news is that both Tatum and Dewan are just enough to best the bum script. They are likeable and their dance talent is undeniable.:::0:::C+
The TV spots claim that it "captures the voice of a generation," and if that's the case, then the voice of the youth hasn't changed at all in the five years Save the Last Dance lit up the box office.:::0:::2/4
Tatum and Dewan have none of the chemistry of Astaire and Rogers, but with help from a good supporting cast and talented choreography, the movie rises slightly above the usual cookie-cutter dance-movie fare.:::0:::2/5
Fletcher shows no real talent for the dramatic scenes.:::0:::None
...this is lowest-common-denominator stuff.:::0:::1.5/4
Hood hooks-up with dancing debutante for across the tracks romance.:::1:::3.5/4
Mesmo que falhe como historinha de amor, o longa consegue levar o espectador a sair da sala com a sensacao de que ao menos em seu aspecto musical o projeto nao decepcionou.:::0:::2/5
It's the usual case of great dancing, bad acting and even worse dialogue in this very guilty pleasure for fans of the genre.:::0:::2/5
While Tatum has rough charm, Dewan is more dancer than actress.:::0:::None
...a miscast Rachel Griffiths looks uncomfortable in her role as Principal Gordon and spends her few scenes looking like she's wishing she was somewhere else.:::0:::2/5
This is a cliche-ridden movie by people to whom formula is clearly mother's milk.:::0:::None
Debut director Anne Fletcher fails to put a new spin on umpteen romantic hoofers.:::0:::2/5
This unimaginative, by-the-numbers teen drama never says anything new as it blends dance styles and cultures in innercity Baltimore.:::0:::1.5/5
Stealing freely from Save the Last Dance but unintentionally nixing the wicked dance moves, this teen turd doesn't even have the logical sense to remove its hunky lead's shirt.:::0:::1.5/5
...the dance numbers are overwhelmed by a trite and predictable script that trudges through familiar themes of redemption and acceptance while taking itself far too seriously.:::0:::None
The willingness of said screenwriters to churn these cliches shamelessly makes Step Up an utterly arduous task to sit through.:::0:::1.5/5
It's all strung together by scenes wherein, for no reason at all, everyone dances -- every kind of dance, from break to ballet -- brilliantly, with youth, vigor and passion. And it's great, even when it's silly, which is often.:::1:::3/5
"Step Up" is just what is sounds like: A dance movie, based on a formula that goes back decades..centuries, even. But its good nature, chemistry between its leads, and, let's face it, enjoyable dance numbers make it entertaining.:::1:::3/4
Fletcher ably blends ballet and hip-hop, but the filming itself is often clumsy, and Tatum's relentless African American impersonation quickly wears out its welcome.:::0:::None
Realistically speaking, this is a nice, inoffensive little movie that won't knock the socks off those of us who know the time-tested formula but will enthrall younger viewers who are unfamiliar with it.:::0:::2.5/4
Tells us by the numbers that you can move up in your social class if only you can dance the right steps.:::0:::C+
...concentrates less on the odd-couple idiosyncrasies than on what all the characters in the movie share: a love of moving to music.:::1:::3/4
If you like this genre, there's no reason not to see this. It's a standard teeny bopper romance, that doesn't try to push the envelope. It's a good, safe, bet.:::1:::C+
For a movie about dancing, Step Up is pretty clumsy on its feet.:::0:::2/4
This teen drama may be filled with some great-looking dancing, but its hackneyed, predictable script is a giant step in the wrong direction.:::0:::1.5/4
Step Up may sizzle on the dance floor, but when the dancing stops, the film fizzles.:::0:::2.5/4
A lot of movies are derivative. What makes Step Up particularly dispiriting is that it has almost nothing fresh to add.:::0:::1/4
Step Up plods along as if feeding coins into a cliche meter.:::0:::1.5/4
It's almost as wrong-headed as it is pre-fabricated.:::0:::2/5
Being an urban dance movie, guns make their appearance, along with every stereotype about hip-hop or the young. Don't believe the hype. Just watch them dance.:::0:::2/4
The cast is only one of the picture's shortcomings. It has clunky dialogue, a derivative storyline and some hypocrisy.:::0:::1.5/4
Step Up is so predictable, with every scene loudly announcing what the next one is going to show, that teens in the audience will take lots of breaks to text each other on their phones.:::0:::2/4
Step Up barely bothers to build a memorable story. Instead, the movie rests entirely on the well-sculpted shoulders of charismatic leads Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan.:::1:::2.5/4
Go for the impressive moves. Tolerate the mediocre story.:::1:::2.5/4
Step Up is light on its feet but stumbles badly once it leaves the dance floor.:::0:::2/4
As a routine and predictable romantic dance movie, this one unfolds exactly as you would expect. But the hip-hop dance moves are explosive.:::0:::2.5/5
Until the movie stumbles under the weight of its noble intentions and its tediously formulaic story, it delivers a few lively, well-shot dance sequences and some winning moments.:::0:::2/4
Aside from the dance steps, you've seen it all before.:::0:::C
Dirty Dancing by way of 8 Mile might be the best way to describe Step Up, a likable, predictable musical drama.:::0:::2/4
It's so silly that if often makes the recent, somewhat problematic Take the Lead look considerably better by comparison.:::0:::2/4
It's the storytelling that keeps landing on its keister.:::0:::2/4
Any guy who sits through this date movie deserves to get to third base at least.:::0:::None
Step Up is about following the teen-dance movie recipe without variations, right up to the big finale. By then, Wake Up would have been a better title.:::0:::1.5.4
Formulaic story, filled with flashy, toe-tapping interludes...:::0:::5/10
While the terrific closing number is something to cheer about, I wanted more dancing and less melodrama from 'Step Up.':::0:::None
Step Up sprints over its own soggy foundation of dance movie cliches with the sheer exuberance of its propulsively cut dance sequences.:::1:::2.5/4
Alive with infectious rhythm, likable characters, and slick dance moves, Step Up gives cliches a good name.:::1:::3/4
The cast of mostly unknown actors, who can all really move and sing, are given a story that doesn't make sense and lines that are boring at best and nonsensical at worst.:::0:::2/5
Watching this movie is a painless enough way to kill 100 minutes, but its familiar story and predictable outcome offer nothing fresh.:::0:::2.5/4
... unlike some dance movies, Step Up's aspiring dancers can actually bust a move -- and then some. (Whether they can act is another matter, of course.):::0:::C+
Despite being declared 'one of the film industry's most sought-after choreographers' in the press notes, director Anne Fletcher often films her principal dancers from the waist up.:::0:::2/4
The paper-thin plot is just a figleaf for the singing and dancing, and of that there's lots. These kids can do it, and that more than anything else makes the mediocre script worth the trouble.:::1:::2.5/5
By the numbers, teen-dance romance that takes it's lead from Save The Last Dance, Dirty Dancing and numerous others that it shamelessly imitates.:::0:::2/5
My, he's an uncouth roughneck, but perhaps, just perhaps I can mold his raw talent into the dance partner of my dreams!:::0:::1.5/4
Unless you're a pushover pre-teen with a hankering for lousy acting and 'this is your generation!' screenwriting that would take the label 'hackneyed' as a compliment, I would suggest tangoing over to another movie worth your time.:::0:::D
Formulaic and hokey, but a pleasure to watch. The "male lead," Channing Tatum, lights up the screen with charisma, believability, authenticity and some really great dancing.:::1:::2.5/4
The stars blend decently when they're flailing their limbs, but faced with the horribly earnest dialogue written by Duane Adler and Melissa Rosenberg, neither stands out:::0:::1.5/4
Two Movie Chicks definitely disagree. One thought it had plenty of humor and tons of great dancing; the other thought it missed a couple of steps.:::0:::3/5
Whenever Channing Tatum, Jenna Dewan and the rest of the spry young cast start moving, the film springs to life, and when they start talking, 'Step Up' collapses in a heap, like a dancer's discarded sweatshirt.:::0:::2/4
The well-cast leads are more than appealing enough to encourage a rooting interest. Better still, they obviously do their own dancing, and do it very well.:::1:::None
Yeah, there's some cool dancing, but it's not imaginatively lensed, and this whole, by-the-numbers routine takes itself way too seriously.:::0:::C
The dancing is energetic and skillful, and the predictable, hackneyed plot is benign.:::0:::C-
Tatum and Dewan have no chemistry while dancing or making out (not to mention whenever they're unfortunate enough to have to speak).:::0:::1.5/5
Would probably be booted off 'So You Think You Can Dance' and booed off of 'America's Got Talent.':::0:::1/4
Just step up, walk out of the theater and don't look back.:::0:::1/4
When Step Up reaches beyond the dance floor... the movie fatally stumbles and never regains its footing.:::0:::2.5/5
A rough Baltimore kid, armed only with a killer smile and hip-hop moves, falls for a classically trained dancer in another retread of Footloose.:::0:::2.5/5
a hip-hop version of High School Musical, some juvenile delinquency and a drive-by shooting added in to provide some street cred, but still a Disney-fied world where kisses are important and happy endings are guaranteed.:::1:::B
Depressingly predicable to the point of seeming uneventful -- if every scene and emotional beat is visible an act in advance, why bother with a storyline?:::0:::C-
A movie I thought I would hate I ended up liking a lot. Ninety-seven minutes of looking at gorgeous Jenna Dewan gave me a glimpse of what paradise might be like.:::1:::8/10
A formulaic, opposites-attract romance based on whatever music/ dance craze/sport happens to be of interest to young viewers easygoing enough to part with cash without demanding creativity.:::0:::2/4
Predictable in every respect, the story line mainly serves as an excuse for a series of exuberant dance routines, thankfully choreographed by Fletcher to show off the dancers' entire forms rather than just flashing body parts.:::0:::None
Step Up never quite does fly: its dance routines are low-voltage, the star chemistry is weak, the characters are cliches and the movie is practically an instant remake of Dewan's other '06 dance musical, Take the Lead,.:::0:::C
While the music keeps things in step with the dancing, the rest of the you've-seen-it-before story has trouble keeping up.:::0:::2.5/4
It's hard to feel the fire in Step Up because of how stars Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum dance: separately. The movie lacks the pairs dance sequences that show how romance moves.:::0:::C
Choreographer Fletcher's directorial debut may be a bit clunky, and how many teen flicks like this have we seen?:::0:::C+
You can sort of see the appeal of Step Up, especially during the dead of summer. It's totally mindless eye candy.:::1:::None
While Step Up will pass the time lightly in that air-conditioned theater, it really never amounts to more than a barely warmed over rehash of teen dance flick moves.:::0:::2/4
The movie is as fleeting as the last weekend of summer.:::0:::1.5/5
Alas, most of Step Up takes place away from the dance floor.:::0:::None
About midway through, Step Up sedited mess that follows:::0:::2/5
There are a few standalone enjoyable moments, but the lack of true, onscreen magic makes the film feel like a cheap (albeit expensively produced) card trick that fails to impress. (Parental Review also Available):::0:::None
It's not that The Sorcerer's Apprentice is a particularly great film. But it is a surprisingly satisfying one. An epic comedy adventure, it is humorous and exciting, casting a spell of unrepentant fun.:::1:::7/10
Younger viewers will thrill to the fun bits. Grown-ups will linger on all the ideas and scenes that play off as weaker versions of better stories.:::0:::2/5
Stuck in that unfortunate movie limbo of being too innocuous for its own good.:::0:::2/4
What's onscreen isn't nearly as inviting or whimsical as the animated short. Instead, the feature is a winded stunt show, brought to its knees by overcooked writing and insistently fruitless attempts at comedy.:::0:::C
A pinch of movie magic makes this fantasy action movie a summer movie popcorn pleasure for kids and their families.:::1:::B+
Clanky, overblown and impersonal, a metallic bombardment of empty CGI pizazz and very little heart. For a film all about magic, it's amazing how indifferent the whole corporate enterprise leaves the viewer.:::0:::1.5/4
Cage will likely not earn a second Oscar here, but he and director Jon Turteltaub make leftovers into fine PG malarkey with their hokey naivete and prankish hocus-pocus.:::1:::None
A fun slice of escapist entertainment that's teeming with the kind of creativity Disney used to be famous for.:::1:::3/5
Nick Cage and Jay Baruchel do their best to deliver more than perfunctory Disney live-action fare, but ultimately nothing can rise above this ill-conceived storyline.:::0:::C
This charming Disney adventure (with just a touch of evil wizardry and black magic) is bag-of-tricks fun.:::1:::None
[Baruchel] nearly redeems the thing ... The surprise of The Sorcerer's Apprentice is that it's less satisfying as an adventure than as endearing nerd romance.:::1:::3/5
There's no logic in The Sorcerer's Apprentice that can't be, and mostly isn't, made up on the spot, a concept that will likely appeal to real-life 10 year olds but irk everyone else.:::0:::2/4
With many cooks in the writing, this CGI adventure is structurally disjointed and dramatically uninvolving, and the chemistry between reliable star Cage and charming Baruchel is not strong, which explains why the producers stress the literary pedigree.:::0:::C
Did Bruckheimer think of doing a human reenactment of Mickey Mouse in Sorcerer's Apprentice from Fantasia - and then decided to build a whole movie around it?:::0:::None
Over-indulgence tips the wand toward weak magic.:::0:::3.5/5
A bracing brew of a supernatural kid flick, stirring in all the dazzling magical ingredients optimum for casting a spell over audiences of all ages. While for a refreshing change, reading minds rather than mindlessly smashing them to bloody bits.:::1:::None
A noisy, f/x-spewing cauldron of a movie.:::0:::None
A tired relic of summer-movie cliches, clearly beaten to death by far too many credited writers.:::0:::None
Fairly fun, and occasionally exciting, but so bombastic that you'll feel more like you're being bombarded, than actually watching a film.:::0:::5.5/10
Cage gets paid and kisses Monica Bellucci. I burned off 2 hours in Hell. This movie is not for kids, it's for toddlers.:::0:::None
The effects are spellbinding in The Sorcerer's Apprentice, but otherwise this Nicolas Cage fantasy film isn't particularly magical.:::0:::None
:::1:::3/4
:::0:::None
It takes a kind of genius to combine a children's movie for grown-ups and a grown-up's movie for children in one glittering digimated package, yet the folks at Pixar have done it time and again.:::1:::5/5
Maybe, sadly, there comes a time when the toys of childhood have to be packed away. But, not as long as this movie is playing which, we expect, will be forever.:::1:::None
Come for the joyful kid stuff, but be warned, these animators don't play around.:::1:::4/5
As much as we may love Woody, Buzz, and the other characters in this toy box, Toy Story 3 shows it's time for Pixar to put away these toys for good.:::1:::3/5
Forget Butch and Sundance, Bogart and Bacall or Hepburn and Tracy. There is no more engaging double act in the movies than Woody and Buzz and the pair make a triumphant, long-awaited comeback in Toy Story 3.:::1:::None
Tthis is one of the best films with the number three in the title you're ever likely to see.:::1:::None
Toy Story 3 does not live up to its predecessors. It surpasses them.:::1:::4/4
The sheer artistry makes it worth watching, even as it sends the wee ones shrieking into their mothers' arms.:::1:::3/5
Toy Story 3 is just the right mix of adventure, joy and, most of all, wonder that we all need right now.:::1:::A-
It's sweet, innocent, intelligent, poignant -- and, most importantly, as wonderfully playful as movies can be.:::1:::None
While the franchise's sentimental mould is inviolable, this sequel has a darker, more satirical edge.:::1:::None
More than 10 years have passed since Toy Story 2 but that lengthy absence has only increased the appetite for a further adventure and allowed the geniuses at Pixar to devise an inventive and satisfying story.:::1:::5/5
Genuinely moving and a beautiful farewell to a beloved series, Toy Story 3 is the must-see movie of the summer.:::1:::10/10
Consider it one last farewell to the innocence of youth and bid adieu to this Story.:::1:::None
Sit back, put on your glasses, and enjoy: It's summer, and Pixar has made you a treat.:::1:::None
When teenaged Andy plops down on the grass to share his old toys with a shy little girl, the film spikes with sadness and layered pleasure -- a concise, deeply wise expression of the ephemeral that feels real and yet utterly transporting.:::1:::None
There are many sweet laughs and joking allusions to horror and prison-break movies, but the Pixar gang gets at the most primary fear -- being cast off and no longer of use.:::1:::None
While the concept has turned darker, Toy Story 3 carries it off brilliantly.:::1:::4/5
The whole project is so masterfully conceived and executed that you either go along for the ride or sit in stunned appreciation for how singularly Pixar has maintained control over the creative quality of its output.:::1:::4/4
I seriously doubt there will be a more hilarious and heartfelt blockbuster all summer.:::1:::None
From 1995's Toy Story to now, we know these are not mere toys. Woody, Buzz and the rest have inner lives of their own, demonstrating unconditional loyalty, love, camaraderie and tearjerking nostalgia.:::1:::B
This one wraps up the series perfectly and lets us all move on.:::1:::A
... this is [Pixar's] prison film, and they load it with suspense, clever references, invention and action.:::1:::4/5
While this is a good sequel, I wish it had had more of the emotion that had made the first two films so memorable.:::1:::3/4
You can intellectualise and even defend the reasons why the film is disappointing, but that doesn't stop it being disappointing.:::0:::None
It's still more inventive, clever and laugh-out-loud funny than any other movie out there now.:::1:::None
Toy Story 3 is probably the best of the series ...:::1:::None
Another worthy entry in a much-heralded series that amounts to a prison break story as exciting in its own way as Steve McQueen's "The Great Escape".:::1:::None
"Toy Story 3" is a bit on the safe side, hemmed in by its concept from offering the imagination that makes the best Pixar has to offer so good ... but the filmmakers still understand real heart.:::1:::7/10
I can understand the creators not wanting to sugarcoat life merely because the colors are brighter and voices chirpier, but why is Toy Story 3 so intent on being such a manipulative downer?:::1:::2.5/4
Woody, Buzz & Co. triumph again but lose a bit of magic.:::1:::4.0
Pixar have once again reminded me that there is a way to create a film that not only appeals to just about everyone, but also prove that three-quels need not suck.:::1:::None
A story with timeless, universal themes: family, coming of age (and leaving behind childish things), and the inevitable time when, past our prime, we will all face potential social obsolence. [Blu-ray]:::1:::4/4
These toys may be old, but there's still plenty of mileage left in 'em.:::1:::8/10
It's funny, warm, clever, exciting and touching, a story of friendship and imagination and a last blast of childhood joy...:::1:::None
A kids' movie for grown-ups. A grown-up movie for kids. Exactly what you'd expect -- and hope for -- from the latest, and we're guessing final, Woody and Buzz adventure.:::1:::5/5
It may be darker, but favorite moments abound in this film--Pixar treats that make "Toy Story 3" a fun film to watch over and over.:::1:::9/10
The question was never going to be, 'Is Toy Story 3 any good?' ... The question could only be, 'To what degree does Toy Story 3 make you wish you could grab a hold of the wonder that is life and squeeze it as if it were a teddy bear?':::1:::4.5/5
Toy Story 3 has all the sass, action, and derring do of the Indiana Jones movies, the charm, admiration, and fun of its predecessors and cousins at Pixar, and enough laughter and imagination to fuel generations to come,:::1:::4.5/5
Impecable produccion en todos sentidos... sin embargo, es una version menos blanca y mas cargada de dramatismo. Una cinta mas para adultos que para ninos.:::1:::4/5
The Toy Story movies have always been impossible not to love thanks to their mixture of heart, humour and action, but this last goodbye is the best yet.:::1:::5/5
Toy Story 3 is equal parts hilarious, touching, insightful and exciting and anyone who doesn't come out smiling probably isn't human.:::1:::4.5/5

Bonnie is a touching tribute to the unbridled childhood imagination -- quite clearly, the kind of child who grows up to be a Pixar animator.:::1:::None
The best film Pixar have ever made.:::1:::None
By [Pixar's] high standards this isn't the best, but by anyone else's, it's close to perfection.:::1:::4/5
I tried stuffing paper into my nose and into my mouth and in my ears to stop the flow. It was hopeless. Toy Story 3 is not only a masterpiece but is the most heart-rending film I have ever seen.:::1:::5/5
The perfect film does not, and cannot, exist. But if it did, it would probably look a lot like this.:::1:::5/5
Even the hardest of hearts will have melted by the time the lights come back up.:::1:::5/5
It's a sign of Pixar's ongoing brilliance that even when there would appear to be no real need for another Toy Story sequel the studio delivers one that feels utterly essential.:::1:::5/5
Toy Story 3 surpasses the 1995 original and its 1999 sequel for thrills, spills and laughs, delivering the most satisfying journey of the trilogy.:::1:::None
It's an effortlessly superior family movie.:::1:::4/5
I doubt we'll see better all year.:::1:::5/5
This is an almost flawless example of a movie that will keep pretty much any person of any age enthralled and entertained.:::1:::5/5
It's a film that moves as much as it entertains, that will make adults cry as much as -- perhaps even more than -- younger children.:::1:::4/5
A film to enrapture children, and make adults weep. Plastic cowboy hats off to Pixar once again.:::1:::5/5
The 'Toy Story' films are deservedly seen as the gold standard for computer-generated animation...:::1:::4/5
Toy Story 3 is clever, inventive and deeply moving, a fabulous film which can be enjoyed by all ages -- and you can't say that about many movies.:::1:::5/5
If there were a Nobel Prize for Digital Animation it would have been won almost every year by Pixar.:::1:::5/5
The glow of originality may have dimmed, but Pixar's third rummage in the toy box delivers exactly what it's supposed to, with appealing fringe benefits.:::1:::4/5
A fitting, poignant close to the series, and -- thankfully -- entertaining not only for kids of all ages, but people of all ages too.:::1:::5/5
Like an overdue reunion with an old friend... it's a trilogy that's grown up without losing its soul.:::1:::5/5
An absolutely dreadful summer at the movies is rescued by the wizards at Pixar.:::1:::4.5/5
Toy Story 3 expertly combines dazzling visuals and thrilling adventure, with a touching story about saying goodbye to old friends.:::1:::4/5
It's sadder and scarier than its predecessors, but it also may be the most important chapter in the tale.:::1:::None
There's legitimate poignancy in the way the characters have retained their handcrafted look even after 15 years of ruthlessly streamlined computer animation:::1:::None
The film succeeds mostly because yes, it's more of the same.:::1:::4.5/5
But for a nip tuck, Toy Story 3 might be a masterpiece. Heck, I'll take it anyway.:::1:::B+
These toys are unbreakable - in a series that will last to infinity and beyond!:::1:::8/10
I appreciate it as an efficient, effective machine - even a thing of beauty. But you can't make me love it. And it scares me just a little that so many of you love it so loudly.:::1:::89/100
You can't get your childhood back but for one hour and 38 minutes Toy Story 3 gets you pretty close. Oh, and by the way -- your kids will love it, too.:::1:::5/5
It makes sense that the film was penned by Michael Arndt, whose Little Miss Sunshine provided a similar balance of mirth and melancholy.:::1:::5/5
The writing quality is what makes this film work as a comedy, an adventure, and a film with some serious affecting human drama.:::1:::8/10
To call this film critic-proof is an understatement, but here's a fact: there really isn't any way to improve upon Pixar's pitch perfect ending to their Toy Story saga.:::1:::4.0/4.0
The best movie of the year so far.:::1:::5/5
Another outing for Woody and the gang, another masterpiece for Pixar.:::1:::4/4
Toy Story 3 is a Mr. Potato Heady assemblage of nostalgia, excitement, and danger. It flies in all directions, but Woody keeps it pleasurably intact.:::1:::3.0/5
Like all the best sequels, Toy Story 3 builds upon and deepens the characters, relationships, and themes that fueled the previous entries in the series:::1:::4/4
When graded on the Pixar curve Toy Story 3 feels, even for all its scariness and darkness, kind of weightless.:::1:::8.5/10
It's by now a worn out verdict: Another masterpiece by Disney/Pixar.:::1:::A
Managing to create real moments of suspense, a hugely powerful emotional sequence towards the end is testament to the relationships we've built up with this bunch of toys.:::1:::5/5
A fun adventure with plenty of laughs and a strong narrative. It will undoubtedly capture the attention of both kids and adults. It's almost impossible not to like.:::1:::A-
Funny, inventive, touching; flawless.:::1:::5/5
The pain of goodbye is beautifully balanced by the trademark excellence of the Toy Story series. A fantastic way to go out.:::1:::5/5
And it's not cheap sentiment. There's something really deep and sweet about everything in the Toy Story series.:::1:::4.5/5
The 3D animation is quite beautiful, and there's the usual bonus of a Pixar short film before the feature, the clever and enchanting Night and Day.:::1:::3.5.5
Perhaps it's more likely to give parents nightmares than children!:::1:::None
While packed to the margins with witty jokes and visual gags, the charming third instalment never loses sight of its emotional core.:::1:::None
Once again, you're left with a groundswell of admiration for the skilled people at Pixar, who have an uncanny way of balancing emotional weight with outrageous moments of comedy and action.:::1:::A
Anyone who's ever felt left out and abandoned will understand the emotional heart of this triumphant tale of friendship and loyalty.:::1:::3.5/4
I found myself crying a bit for these animated inanimate objects.:::1:::5/5

As people grow up, life moves on, and it's inevitable that they'll part from people, places and things they love. Toy Story 3 illustrates this movingly and with real poignancy.:::1:::5/5
Amid all the lively antics, this is a thoughtful story about regret for the past and fear of the future.:::1:::5/5
This is another home run for Pixar. A perfect conclusion to a perfect movie trilogy.:::1:::4/4
Woody and the gang stare into the abyss in this crazy, inspired homage to jailbreak films:::1:::A
Such a deep wrap-up that it makes the previous two movies feel like episodes, while this movie feels like the summation.:::1:::10/10
Despite its flaws, it retains the innocence, charm and (some of) the wit of the classics, and handles some potentially difficult subjects with Pixar's now-trademark ingenuity.:::1:::None
Worthy threequel to the wonderful Toy Story franchise with gorgeous animation, terrific vocal performances and a brilliantly written script that's consistently both laugh-out-loud funny and powerfully emotional.:::1:::5/5
It doesn't try to surpass its predecessors but simply continues the story in such a wonderful, natural progression that it melds with ease into the brilliance that is the Toy Story lore.:::1:::4/4
Aims right for the sadness and ache that comes along as life shifts around you.:::1:::5/5
Another Pixar masterpiece, capping a groundbreaking and exciting trilogy. Emotional, well crafted and intelligent. The hallmarks of Pixar quality.:::1:::3.5/4
The best of the bunch. Touches the funny bone, the brain and the heart.:::1:::9/10
The film does go through a lot of extra action sequences just to fill up time (not just one, but three trips in a dump truck) but it is worth the wait for that exquisite ending.:::1:::B+
Pretty much a perfect film...:::1:::10/10
Driven by a good plot and clearly defined characters, Toy Story 3 is injected with humour and powered by fun as the adventure of their lives brings these toys together in ways that will entertain and move you:::1:::None
Everything works: from the excellent voice cast to the way the story naturally evolves and leaves us in a happy place. This is a film that will certainly endure the test of time:::1:::None
Balances rollicking adventure, personality-driven comedy and wrenching pathos with a deftness only surpassed by a handful of animation efforts.:::1:::B+
The Pixar team are true masters of their craft. Their stellar cinematic efforts do indeed go to infinity and beyond:::1:::None
Ever moreso than the other films: you only thought you felt bad about your old toys--oh my God, you're going to feel horrible.:::1:::4.5/5
The perfect ending to a near perfect series of films.:::1:::4/4
I was shocked with how much joy and sweet sadness this threequel gave me. I will no longer doubt you, Pixar.:::1:::10/10
The emotional roller coaster this film takes its audience on is better than anything at Disneyland.:::1:::A+
It shouldn't be surprising that Pixar can make a sequel that retains all the charm of the film that preceded it. After all, they've done it before.:::1:::4.5/5
The storytelling and animation are delightfully engaging.:::1:::4/5
There is so much to be absorbed here that a second viewing, at least, is a prerequisite.:::1:::None
Pure, unadulterated enjoyment ---:::1:::None
At best, Toy Story 3 stands as a refinement of Toy Story 2, a movie which was an unnecessary sequel to begin with.:::0:::44/100
Toy Story 3 is a remarkable film and a fitting conclusion to one of the most consistently enjoyable trilogies ever made.:::1:::4.5/5
This endearing escapist summer adventure will bring tears to your eyes and is not to be missed. The design work is spectacular and the cinematography is vivid utilizing every color imaginable in the crayon box. The sight gags and jokes make this a...:::1:::4/4
Toy Story 3 feels like a once-every-five-years confluence of perfection in tone, delivery, timing, humor and drama.:::1:::4/4
The eternal questions that the first two movies raised, about what happens to toys when playtime is over, are answered in ways that are both surprising and gently comforting.:::1:::4/4
[I]t seemed like a good thing not to get one's hopes up too much... because how long can Pixar's streak of genius and spirit and wonder last?... [But this] brings the overarching story to its satisfying conclusion...:::1:::None

If this is the final chapter of the toys from Pixar, then I couldn't have imagined a better send off...:::1:::None
By the high standards of Pixar, the new Toy Story falls slightly short - which means it's still better than anything else in the computer-animated sweepstakes.:::1:::None
Three-peats may be rare in the sports world, but they're even harder to achieve in the cinematic realm. Yet Toy Story 3 emerges as the perfect final chapter in a trilogy that's guaranteed to live on for generations (to infinity and beyond?).:::1:::4/4
What a triumph this incredible new 'Toy Story' adventure is! It does a terrific job emphasizing the relationship between toys and a child's imagination.:::1:::None
I wish I could be one of the few to hate on this movie, it'd drive up my traffic numbers. But I can't, it has an Evil Stuffed Bear! Toy Story 3 is not perfect, but it's strong. This coming from a Pixar Hater.:::1:::B+
Pixar produces the best movies on the planet. Period. Want proof? After Toy Story 3 the audience cried then cheered. And critics cried. Critics don't cry. Ever.:::1:::5/5
Another summer, another Pixar feature, another masterpiece.:::1:::9/10
The intelligence, wit, emotion and sheer care that the studio brings to this production is more than enough to make up for the few instances where its ambition outstrips its execution.:::1:::3.5/4
In TS3, we come full circle to the biggest question of all: What does it mean not to feel outdated, or misunderstood, but truly useless? It's Waiting For Godot at Lego scale.:::1:::4/4

Woody's insistence on rallying everyone back to their bedroom makes him the toy box Tina Turner, and the flick is smart enough to know it.:::1:::A
Toy Story is a funny, touching and most excellent farewell to the characters we've come to know and love.:::1:::4.5/5
Delivers the goods as an engaging animated adventure and also gives the characters we've come to love the farewell they deserve.:::1:::4.5/5
The gags are all of a piece, right up to the forlorn yet enchanting finale.:::1:::None
I hope this is the last Toy Story...a fitting and moving final chapter that takes the premise of the first movie to its logical conclusion.:::1:::4/4
Toy Story 3 is so besotted with brand names and product-placement that it stops being about the innocent pleasures of imagination -- the usefulness of toys -- and strictly celebrates consumerism.:::0:::None
[VIDEO ESSAY] An obvious split between the accomplished progression of the first two movies and the inferior last installment is the departure of the enormously talented writer Peter Docter from the franchise.:::0:::C+
Make no mistake: this Toy Story trilogy, and Toy Story 3 in particular, is a great work of art - one of the cleverest pieces of story-telling magic that Hollywood has ever conjured.:::1:::5/5
It's said Pixar doesn't make bad movies. It may jump the shark one day, but I'm happy to report that day isn't today.:::1:::4/5
At its best, most moving moments, Toy Story 3 is a story about the pang of a young adult moving away from home and leaving child-like things behind.:::1:::3/4
It hits every button from laughter to tears and lifts you up on waves of visual dazzlement. And you don't need to take a kid along to appreciate it... Tag it as one of the year's best.:::1:::3.5/4
Suffice it to say that it's the funniest comedy and the most exciting action movie I've seen so far this year. (And I might have ruined a vintage handkerchief during the last 20 or so minutes of the film, but I'm not saying.):::1:::None
What Pixar does better than any other artistic source is make us believe, including the notion that a fourth Toy Story, if it ever happens, would be even more carefully perfected than this.:::1:::A
Toy Story 3 succeeds not because of its glossy and gleaming high-tech pixels, but rather because it is so well-written that you could tell it with low-tech hand puppets and still thrill and reach an audience of children and adults both.:::1:::4.5/5
Consider the oft-amusing, terribly clever G-rated sequel Toy Story 3 as the brightest student in the class delivering a very fine B paper.:::1:::3/4
characters that are as real as a kid's sense of wonder, and the kind of magic that transports everyone in the audience, regardless of age:::1:::5/5
Pixar does it again - that is, they take a bunch of animated toys and teach us all about the human heart in an entertaining, magical way.:::1:::A
Enormously entertaining third chapter in the computer-animated series that started it all. Delighted audiences will ensure a long shelf life for Pixar's iconic toy collection.:::1:::None
Briefly loses its footing during the first hour, but still manages to be an imaginative, witty, poignant and hilarious adventure that will captivate everyone. Bring on Toy Story 4!:::1:::9.20/10
Exactly what this bummer of a summer needs -- a creative, intelligent, heartfelt slice of immensely satisfying entertainment.:::1:::4.5/5
Brilliantly tying up the two films that came before in a way that so many sequels fail to do, the geniuses at Pixar have done it again. It's another masterpiece.:::1:::5.0/5
Pixar's storytelling masterminds serve up yet another exceptional film packed with humor, imagination, adventure and emotional resonance.:::1:::4/4
A terrific and funny summer adventure.:::1:::3.5/4
This is how good "Toy Story 3" is: Even the ending credits have more story arc, more emotional resonance, than many other movies have in their entire running time.:::1:::4/4
In execution, entertainment value and integrity, the latest Pixar animated feature vastly outdoes the live-action summer movie fare that surrounds it.:::1:::4/4
If the first half is uncertain, the second is flat brilliant.:::1:::3.5/4
Both a paean and a monument to creativity and the love of things that bring us joy. Please reward the studio for giving us the best.:::1:::5/5
Adults, especially those who had -- or still have -- a favorite toy will grasp the poignancy underlying the entire feature.:::1:::4/4
I confess: I had to steel myself as if I were preparing for a punch in the face to keep from bawling like a baby during 'Toy Story 3' (which, among many other things, is a very witty spoof of the classic Hollywood prison movie).:::1:::3.5/4
Can we put Pixar in charge of every movie sequel?:::1:::3.5/4
In the cleverly entertaining Toy Story 3, Ken is confused and superficial, and also pretty fabulous.:::1:::8/10
A loving, nostalgic, heartfelt treat for the kid in all of us, 'Toy Story' may be the most treasured animated trilogy of all time.:::1:::10/10
is as close to moviemaking perfection as you could possibly ask for and easily stands as not just the summer's best film, but an easy favorite for the year's best as well.:::1:::5/5
As Lotso, Ned Beatty offers the most compelling portrait of avuncular villainy since, well, Ned Beatty in Network, and Michael Keaton's Ken is the quintessence of himbo-ism.:::1:::None
TS3 is so much more than mere child's play: a poignant, funny and sometimes surprisingly disquieting experience. Pixar has once again flown to infinity ... and beyond.:::1:::8.5/10
Toy Story 3 may not be a masterpiece, but it still had me in tears at the end.:::1:::3.5/4
A bona fide summer delight loaded with action, humor, nostalgia, a veritable blizzard of pop-culture references and general good vibes.:::1:::None
My advice? Bring a tissue.:::1:::4/4
Dare I say that Toy Story 3 is a perfect film? Pixar, yet again, delivers a brilliant film that will make you laugh, cheer and even shed a few tears. Bravo!:::1:::5/5
It's a soulful movie, but it's also very nearly as funny as the earlier Toy movies are.:::1:::3.5/4
A fitting capstone to a landmark series of animated films.:::1:::5/5
The Toy Story saga comes full circle with an installment that's easily as compelling and consistently involving as both Toy Story and Toy Story 2...:::1:::4.5/5
The third time isn't exactly the charm for this friendly series of films, but this next step in the evolution of Buzz and Woody is dutifully manic and frequently engaging.:::1:::B
A true circle of life that may end as the credits roll here but, as all good souls do, finds a way to begin again in a film that is every bit as wonderful as its predecessors.:::1:::4/4
It's a sequel. It's in 3-D. It has no kiddie-flick competition. Really, how good does it have to be? Apparently, as good as Pixar can make it.:::1:::4/4
This third installment co-scripted by Michael Arndt ("Little Miss Sunshine") turns out to be a surprisingly dark evocation of Steven Spielberg's "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence" (2001), readdressing the fear-of-abandonment theme, and it has several chuckle:::1:::B+
A Pixar film is the closest thing you have to a guarantee in Hollywood. Name even one other cinematic enterprise in which you can take your seat, brazenly certain of complete fulfillment.:::1:::10/10
Toy Story 2 remains the high-water mark, but in this finale Pixar once again reaches for the sky.:::1:::A-
How does Pixar keep doing it? I think it's voodoo; does anyone else think it's voodoo?:::1:::A+
I seem to be defending each issue with a surprising amount of forgiveness. Maybe it's one of those amazing conundrums where you love the stuff it does, but you hate how it gets there, and you're stuck with this push-pull of pleasure and remorse.:::1:::None
There's a saying, not often heard in Hollywood: Third time's the charm...Fortunately, Toy Story has had a nice long rest -- it's been 11 years since part two -- while its makers at Pixar have kept in shape with a string of seven hits.:::1:::3.5/4
I don't want to oversell it, but Toy Story 3 is the single greatest thing mankind has ever produced.:::1:::A
If in singing the film's praises one can do no more than follow a familiar hymn sheet, so be it. Like their plastic space ranger, Pixar is a company prepared to reach infinity and beyond, and there's little sense arguing with such lofty ambition.:::1:::None
... if there is a word more complimentary than perfect I would have used it, but I can't come up with one. Wait, now that I think about it, maybe masterpiece is that word. Yep, that will suffice. Toy Story 3 is an absolute masterpiece.:::1:::5/5
A worthy finale to a fantastic franchise.:::1:::B+
This is a highly entertaining, mega enjoyable and extremely well-made pic. (Parental Review also Available):::1:::None
The Pixar team can combine storytelling, art, and emotion into a movie that still surprises and delights the audience whether they are 4-years old or 94-years old.:::1:::4/4
Their last playtime, an emotionally potent assertion of the importance of memory and the ongoing cycle of childhood wonderment, has come, and it has been a joyful dance.:::1:::4/4
A work so effortlessly charming and emotionally powerful that viewers will find their faith in the power and glory of film at least temporarily restored.:::1:::5/5
Smart, funny "threequel" a little scarier than first two.:::1:::5/5
The ending is the best scene in the best movie of the year, a deeply moving smiling-through-tears moment that I won't soon forget.:::1:::A
A fine family film with an edifying tale, endearing and funny characters, and an appealing emotional undertow.:::1:::4.5/5
While the 3D "Toy Story 3" isn't utter perfection, as the first two films were, it is a welcome reunion with old friends, often funny and eventually quite moving.:::1:::B+
...one of Pixar's top-three finest works and, if the Academy does what is right, a surefire Best Picture candidate.:::1:::A+
My kind of romantic comedy. It's funny, a bit silly and doesn't try to set the new standard for romance in the genre. It's exactly what you expect, but in a good way.:::1:::6/10
Most of the troubles come from the painfully unfunny shenanigans of Beth's magic-stricken admirers.:::0:::C-
When in Rome never delves deep into anything, but whisks us through the conventions of romantic comedies so quickly there's barely time to groan.:::0:::None
When in Rome is an insipid waste; every ounce of potential has been steadfastly turned away from in order to make a safe little piece of clowning.:::0:::4.5/10
[Bell] carries a classic presence and charm that is tough not to like. Yet, at the same time, she does so with a little spunk and sass.:::1:::None
...we are expected to suspend our disbelief and accept that the adorable Kristen Bell needs some sort of crackpot magic spell to attract suitors.:::0:::77/100
You know from the start of Mark Steven Johnson's silly, sunny romcom how it's going to end.:::0:::2/5
Number of record-scratch jokes? Three. Number of walk-into-a-lamppost gags? Two. Number of laughs? Take a wild guess.:::0:::1/5
Despite its over-the-top zaniness, this romantic comedy manages to keep us entertained with its starry cast and a nutty plot. If only the filmmakers had resisted the urge to exaggerate both the humour and the sentimentality.:::0:::2/5
This Italian-themed romcom is not quite the most unspeakably-patronising-to-Italy film of all time. That prize belongs to the musical Nine, starring Daniel Day-Lewis. But it runs a very close second.:::0:::1/5
All you need to know about When In Rome is that it was written by David Diamond and David Weissman, who perpetrated the atrocity that was the Robin Williams-John Travolta 'comedy' Old Dogs.:::1:::3/5
Ladies, here's a chick-flick best enjoyed with your eyelids actually glued together.:::0:::1/5
On the up side, it has a decent cast, but class acts like Anjelica Huston aren't given enough to do. And Danny DeVito has to say awful lines like "There's not an emotion on earth that can't be expressed through sausage.":::0:::2/5
This is nothing more than a throwaway comedy clumsily assembled from a half-decent idea.:::0:::1/5
When in Rome is watchable enough, albeit in a cheesily inept way, but is far less magical than its storyline.:::0:::2/5
It's all a bit of harmless froth and nonsense -- as long as you're not too disturbed by the sight of DeVito chasing Bell around the Guggenheim like Benny Hill on Viagra.:::0:::2/5
A witless realization of a promising supernatural premise suggests that a few people involved with the movie don't have a particular talent for it.:::0:::1.5/5
...the movie boasts a seriously underwhelming premise that ultimately negates the good will established (and perpetuated) by its stars.:::0:::2/4
When I saw the trailer for When in Rome I laughed like crazy. I wish the movie were as funny.:::0:::6/10
This appealing, fun pairing gives the film some promise--that is just as immediately shot to hell once the big plot hook/gimmick kicks in.:::0:::1.5/4
Josh Duhamel as the romantic lead is an underdeveloped cardboard cut-out and, more generally, the film's simplistic emotional foundations never let it really connect.:::0:::None
I'm not cynical about hope, just the way that romantic comedies exploit it, without necessarily delivering. When in Rome does that to a large degree, even basing its conceit on a wishing well, the ultimate exploitation of hope.:::0:::2/5
It manages to be reasonably fun, kind of funny and just a little charming, and will be fine to watch with your Disney rom-com loving kids on DVD.:::1:::3/5
Succeeds only in displaying Bell's lack of comic flair.:::0:::1.5/5
Kristen Bell and Josh Duhamel are attractive enough but they can't elevate this seriously silly rom-com.:::0:::1.5/5
As with most romantic comedies, this misunderstanding could have been resolved with a simple question, but instead the film stumbles along towards its predictably happy conclusion.:::0:::None
Never mind that the script is far fetched. The plot, the characters and the dialogue - individually and as a whole, simply do not work. The ideas fall as flat as a squashed sausage, and that includes Danny DeVito's sausage king:::0:::None
Despite the surfeit of cliches and apparent lack of any original thought in this hopelessly contrived rom-com, it remains a reasonably amiable exercise.:::0:::2/5
A silly, preposterous romantic comedy that benefits from Josh Duhamel's self-assured likeability, which helps a thin script that relies on pratfalls not brain power.:::0:::C
The scenery is dull and the romance is a boring ride--neither the places nor people offer much to write home about. Aimless and ambling along, this is a rom-com that seems totally random.:::0:::None
The only reason this isn't the worst romantic comedy in recent memory is that this reviewer also had to review the recent Sandra Bullock disaster All About Steve.:::0:::1/5
'When in Rome' is a brainless mess of silly characters doing stupid things on camera. Everyone involved should be completely embarrassed.:::0:::None

With Rome it's the same old song and dance.:::0:::2.0/4.0

Mark Steven Johnson exhibits neither an eye nor an ear for comedy - he must have been deaf and dumb to agree to shoot a script by Davids Diamond and Weissman, the duo who penned the execrable Old Dogs.:::0:::0/4
Be very wary of a movie poster that features a winsome blonde biting her pinkie. That's the primary lesson learned from this wretched rom-com in which cutsey nail-nibbling is supposed to be seductive.:::0:::3/10
Keep your coin far away from this toxic fountain of crap.:::0:::1/5
It's not as bad as it appears to be from the trailers.:::0:::2/4
Two good looking lead actors but they show substandard acting skills; in truth the sketchy script gave them little with which to work.:::0:::3/10
Instead of being booked into theaters, 'When in Rome' would be a better fit for one of the Eternal City's apocryphal vomitoriums.:::0:::0/4
"When in Rome" was the freshness that the romcom genre needed.:::1:::3/5
The dialogue isn't funny and the filmmakers no nothing about comic timing. Has no one heard of Mel Brooks?:::0:::C-
Alas, bright and breezy are nowhere to be found here. Neither is comedy.:::0:::1/5
Beside the two actual laughs in the film, the cast helps to pull this from the doldrums %u2013 but not far.:::0:::C-
Last time I checked, films had plot, characters (and character development) and, if nothing else, some semblance of a purpose other than to make money. Such is not the case here. At all.:::0:::F
...its main interest lies in figuring out just why people like Peggy Lipton and Don Johnson came out of the woodwork to play parts with practically no lines ..:::0:::D+
When in Rome needs every ounce of its leads' twinkly appeal to keep us engaged.:::1:::2.5/4
Despite the appeal of its co-stars, this romantic comedy is undermined by over-the-top performances from some of its actors as well as the movie's frantic pace.:::0:::None
It's sort of totally cool how Kristen doesn't call the cops when Will Arnett is chasing her through Central Park or Napoleon Dynamite breaks into her apartment. Because we girls know that stalking really is how men show their affection!:::0:::None
This will gnaw at many a critic, but the estrogen-infused target audience will eat both actors up.:::1:::3/5
Sweet, romantic and genuine, When in Rome, which features a consistently charming Kristen Bell, is certainly fluff, but it is very entertaining and enjoyable.:::1:::3/4
A romantic comedy without much to offer in the way of character, conflict, or canoodling.:::0:::None
One step forward for Kristen Bell, one giant leap backward for womankind.:::0:::1/5
It lurches along, making Ms. Bell and Mr. Duhamel look duller than they need to.:::0:::1.5/5
How do I loathe thee? Let me count the ways.:::0:::1/5
All it has is contrivance -- a central one that makes no sense whatsoever, and a whole mess of sub-contrivances that seemed to have been added to the script to make it almost add up to an hour and a half.:::0:::2.5/5
A bunch of eager performers troll for laughs that never come.:::0:::None
In the case of When in Rome, oh to do what the Romans used to do: Toss the bloody thing to the lions.:::0:::1/4
We get three acts of labored slapstick wrung from an eye-roller of a premise.:::0:::D+
A brainless, fizzy, romantic-comedy fairy tale with a roster of acting talent far beyond expectations.:::0:::C
Josh Duhamel plays the smitten sports reporter who helps Kristen Bell mount her big art show, "Pain"-a fitting title, given the agony induced by this godawful comedy.:::0:::None
On this simple, sheeplike level, the thoroughly average When in Rome qualifies as almost a complete success, except in its requirement that we go along with some business involving hocus pocus.:::1:::3/5
Teen-appeal actors disappoint in stereotypical romcom.:::0:::1/5
There's so much wrong with David Diamond and David Weissman's plot that, with a nod to the Guggenheim Museum's spiral ramp, it's hard to know where to begin.:::0:::1/10
A movie that is partly romantic and slightly funny, but mostly idiotic and predictable.:::0:::1.5/4
a solid romantic comedy in every regard and avoids being the standard entertaining 'chick flick' by being very enjoyable for both sexes.:::1:::4/5
We're not talking Because I Said So bad, but at least Couples Retreat bad.:::0:::D-
When in Rome plumbs new depths for ineptitude in acting, directing, writing and every other department.:::0:::0/4
What you get with When in Rome is a surprisingly good romantic comedy.:::1:::None
The problem is not the credulity-stretching script. Or even that much of the movie just isn't all that funny. The problem is that it thinks it's freakin' hilarious.:::0:::1/4
The saving grace of the otherwise generic product is that Bell's vivacity and Duhamel's rakish charm allow the viewer to root for them, even if sometimes that rooting goes so far as to wish the script would serve the couple better than it does.:::1:::2.5/4
Bell and Duhamel may have something as a romantic onscreen pair but there's no telling. What's going on around them is both distracting and annoying, thanks to the hyperactivity of the oddball suitors who tend to suck all of the chemistry out of the room.:::0:::1/4
Duhamel throws around his raffish, real-guy charm, and Bell works a springy cynicism that When in Rome eagerly tries to strip away. But regardless of where its stars want to take it, all roads here lead to blandness and inanity.:::0:::2/5
Kristen Bell and Josh Duhamel are so funny, quirky and appealing I'd love to root for them in a good romantic comedy, but When in Rome isn't it.:::0:::2/4
The forced misunderstandings, clumsy attempts at comedy, and late-third-act turnarounds are so absolutely rote and graceless that not even the charm of the poor actors consigned to this eye-roller can lift the movie out of its grave.:::0:::D+
When in Rome may fall flat in places, but at least it hasn't had all the personality manicured out of it.:::1:::None
It may fall apart in the end, but this is a movie that won't let its audience get bored.:::1:::3/5

Parental Content Review:::0:::None
An exceptionally strong cast makes this fantasy romantic comedy trifle pleasantly watchable despite its chick-lit conventions.:::1:::B-
A romantic comedy of such staggering ineptness that it actually makes one wish the filmmaker would redirect his attention back to the superhero genre he sullied.:::0:::0/4
Veronica Mars would scoff at a movie like When in Rome, and understandably so.:::0:::2/4
When in Rome is even worse than this year's first romantic comedy offering, Leap Year.:::0:::1/4
Comedies require precision, and there's none here; instead, characters and scenes bash into each other with no evident purpose or logic.:::0:::1.5/4
It's all exceptionally predictable and disappointingly laugh-free, especialleems to get bored by the dancing and shifts to a pointless gang violence subplot.:::0:::2/4
If only the high school dance-romance Step Up were a sort of wall-to-wall, start-to-finish dance extravaganza. Then, there would be less of a story to complain about.:::0:::2/4
We don't see any of those footprints that dance teachers arrange on the floor to show students where to step, but we certainly can see the handwriting on the wall in terms of where this movie is going.:::0:::0.5/4
Horribly cliched and utterly predictable, Step Up is completely dead when it isn't dancing -- and isn't much better when it is.:::0:::1/4
Step Up is so derivative of films like Dirty Dancing, Save the Last Dance and more that it essentially comes pre-choreographed by other movies.:::0:::1.5/4
While predictability and occasionally wooden dialogue keep this from being a truly good movie, it's certainly entertaining enough to please its intended audience.:::0:::2/4
Step Up is so predictable, so remarkably so, you might wonder how such a movie got made.:::0:::C-
Thin storytelling married to thin bodies of extreme physical grace, this clunky but moderately charming descendant of Saturday Night Fever and Fame covers the usual territory.:::0:::None
... the focus should be on pirouettes, breakdancing, or some giddily ridiculous combination thereof, but the film piles on half a dozen subplots that keep the leads out of pointy shoes.:::0:::C
Though formulaic and rather silly, obstinately hard to dislike, mostly thanks to its boundless energy and its agreeable cast.:::1:::B-
Atrocious writing takes its toll on the cast's considerable energy, which is best showcased in dance sequences that could have been a lot longer given the cloying melodrama that's the viewing alternative.:::0:::2/5
a surprisingly wholesome bit of fluff with an amiably charismatic cast and a script that should be cited for violating the basic tenets of solid scriptwriting:::1:::3/5
Step, under the sure hand of director-choreographer Anne Fletcher, quickly discovers its own virtuoso charms.:::1:::B
The dubious concept of blending ballet with hip-hop dancing is explored only as far as line dance choreography will allow in this cliche-riddled romance that coasts on the strength of its charismatic leads...:::0:::C-
Step Up doesn't front: it has better dance moves--and a more valuable, clear-cut sensibility--than any video nominated for a VMA this year.:::1:::2.5/4

Playing on feelings and impulses that I'm sure we all relate to, a witty and playful portrait of teen love emerges out of a less exciting teen comedy.:::1:::3.5/5
Nick Twisp is no Scott Pilgrim, but this is another witty ensemble comedy that successfully reinvigorates that most benighted of genres, the teen film.:::1:::3/4
Story of "bad-boy" teen is funny, but also rough and raw.:::1:::4/5
Arteta's faithfulness to Payne's text, themes and visions never gel as a wholly satisfying film.:::0:::None

Michael Cera goes to the sweet-tempered high school persona well once (or twice) too often with, sigh, Nick Twisp, who lives in hormonal agony with his sex-obsessed divorced mother (Jean Smart) and her nasty boyfriend.:::0:::80/100

Michael Cera's act got old awful fast, didn't it?:::0:::None
I'm now officially done caring whether Michael Cera loses his virginity. So, it seems in this hit-and-miss comedy, is Cera.:::0:::2.5/4
Smug, dead-air-riddled adaptation of C.D. Payne's novel:::0:::None
The whole thing just seems as if it's trying too hard.:::0:::C
It's chaotic and episodic, but this is Cera's star turn. Superbad meets Fight Club? That'll do it.:::1:::4/5
The tone throughout is moderately quirky rather than full-on teen-flick vulgarian, bolstered by indie-cred cameos.:::1:::3/5
A treat for Cera fans and an amusing diversion for the rest of us. Especially those of us happy to laugh at our inner pretentious teenager.:::1:::4/5
In a wickedly witty dual role in the funniest teen flick in a long time, Cera finally seems to loosen up and have some fun.:::1:::4/5
It is very silly, and it may take you some time to tune in to the giggle wavelength. Once you have, it's very funny.:::1:::4/5
A little too manic for its own good, Youth in Revolt is restless and unruly. Too often forcibly mean-spirited, it only elicits a handful of genuine laughs.:::0:::None
A regularly ribtickling but ultimately unsatisfying ride into the realms of teen angst - but one that showcases the undoubted talents of Michael Cera when he has the opportunity to play against type.:::1:::3/5
A fresh, funny take on the classic coming-of-age tale, and a chance for Cera to show us what he's made of.:::1:::4/5
If you're looking for constant chuckles, memorable scenes, quirky dialogue and hilarious characters then get youthful, get some sweeties and get involved.:::1:::4/5
Whimsical, saucy, funny and achingly embarrassing, this is a beguiling if derivative goodboy- spins-out farce. But Cera really should make this his dweeb swansong lest he outstay his welcome.:::1:::3/5
Gustin Nash's script takes several well-aimed pot shots at typical teen-movie conventions, but has the tendency to occasionally wallow in the crude humour of the American Pie films.:::1:::3/5
This is yet another of those Hollywood coming-of-age movies where no one grows up. I've seen worse, but that's my problem.:::0:::None
The whole thing's a terrible mess and Cera's star, once rapidly rising, is now almost in freefall.:::0:::2/5
Funny in a casual way and charming in an oddball way.:::1:::3/5
The characters and story drive the comedy; the dialogue brings the nuanced grace notes.:::1:::4/5
The contrast between Nick and his bad angel whips up a pleasing comedy of delinquency, flavoured along the way by reliable character turns from Zach Galifianakis, Steve Buscemi, Jean Smart and Ray Liotta. But it's Cera who pulls the thing together.:::1:::3/5
The initial wit is replaced by youthful high jinks, animated interludes and some incredibly convoluted plotting. A shame really because for the first half hour this looked like comedy gold.:::0:::3/5
[Cera's] a fresh enough performer to hold centre stage in comedies like this.:::1:::3/5
Peaches Geldof would probably love it. And film reviews don't get any more depressing than that.:::0:::2/5
Never quite as clever, quirky or funny as it thinks it is.:::0:::3/5
All credit to Cera for trying something a little different. It's just a shame Youth in Revolt feels so episodic and shapeless that it's hard to take any pleasure in its theatre of cruelty.:::0:::2/5
It's very funny to be honest and most of the characters are perfectly cast, but Youth in Revolt is a movie in which literally nothing happens. At no point are any of the characters or plotlines developed and most of them are abandoned towards the end.:::0:::None
A delightfully dark teen comedy with a frequently funny script and superb performances from a terrific cast.:::1:::4/5
...an entertaining comedy about adolescent sexual obsession, Cera gives a breakout performance in a double role.:::1:::7/10
Coming-of-age teen pic, an homage to Breathless, which will probably not take away your breath.:::1:::B-
Michael Cera can't forever play a teenage boy in search of lust. That's a shame, because there are a lot of lousy movies in this genre, and he's in the good ones.:::1:::3/4
Call this one the thinking boy's sex romp.:::1:::3/4
It plays to Cera's strengths, which, though overly familiar at this point, are still strengths.:::1:::B-
If Michael Cera were a dog, he'd probably be a chihuahua. Not a yappy chihuahua, but a nervous, quiet one, lacking in confidence and bravado.:::1:::3/4
Detached from whatever world in which it is set and whatever characters inhabit it.:::0:::1.5/4
A stunningly lazy, smarmy comedy with very few honest laughs.:::0:::4/10
Though ... clearly a comedy, the tone ... is realistic enough to create some of the same discomfort that made last year's Observe and Report either daringly brilliant or just plain creepy, depending on your point of view.:::1:::None
The book may have had a point, the movie doesn't. And when is Michael Cera going to find a different type of role and show some range?:::0:::2/10
I love Michael Cera, just not this time.:::0:::5/10
It runs out of inspiration eventually. But not before a solid hour or so of consistently amusing absurdist humor that's way more off-kilter than is usual for a comedy about randy young men.:::1:::2.5/4
If pretentious hipster kids annoy you in real life, they'll bug the hell out of you in Youth in Revolt.:::0:::2/5
I love this new breed of dirty movie. It goes beyond leering, beyond sexism, to the core tension of a culture that ricochets between Puritanism and promiscuity. And it has in Michael Cera a sterling mascot.:::1:::None
Nick's oversized feet balloon away from his body, as if they're trying to separate themselves from this unbelievably dumb guy. Cera's playing dumb again -- dumb as a fox. But this time, we're in on the joke.:::1:::8/10
This defiant and sinful comedy makes for a hilarious start to 2010.:::1:::3/5
As a whole, "Youth in Revolt" is simply an overwhelming success--as a comedy, a romance, and as a new career-high for Michael Cera. A dark, stylish and incredibly funny triumph.:::1:::A
As for Michael Cera's career? Look a falling star! Make a wish!:::0:::.5/4
Pretentious, but lovingly so.:::1:::None
Michael Cera puts another notch in his droll performance belt.:::1:::3/4
Despite a few good moments, 'Youth in Revolt' turns out to be a hodgepodge of dysfunctional family scenes, drug sequences, lustful teens and cartoon inserts.:::0:::None
This is film clearly made by people who remember all to well what it was like to be a teenager throbbing with hormones.:::1:::3/4
Youth in Revolt? Forget that! Let's focus on critic in revolt. Even a little [Michael] Cera is too much.:::0:::2.5/5
Whimsical, mostly engaging and occasionally funny, but it's too uneven, pretentious, and lacks genuine poignancy as a coming of age story.:::0:::5.75/10
Arteta commits to the lasciviousness, turning Youth in Revolt into more of a self-aware, comedic adaptation of Scott Spencer's Endless Love, which was originally botched by Franco Zeffireli.:::1:::None
An oddball adolescent goes on a wild quest to lose his virginity and to find true love with a seductive and mysterious young woman.:::1:::4/5
Cera proves that he can also do more than capitalize on his boyish face.:::1:::4/5
Finally, hipster intellectuals have a Porky's of their own.:::1:::3/5
Just roll with the amusement provided by Cera and a deep supporting cast (Justin Long, Fred Willard, Adhir Kalyan, Jonathan B. Wright) and the ability of director Arteta and screenwriter Gustin Nash to keep matters at just the right ironic distance.:::1:::3/4
If you were to hire a high-profile lawyer, you could probably come up with a convincing false advertising claim against the people who put together the trailers for Youth in Revolt.:::1:::3.5/5
A clever and often riotous burst of cynicism that pushes, let's face it, some pretty questionable ideas.:::1:::3/4
Cera may be trapped in his unchanging persona, but no more than this picture is walled in by its sitcom conventions.:::0:::2/4
Youth in Revolt is a teen fantasy filled with lust, imagination, frustration and lots of laughs, artfully made and superbly played.:::1:::B+
A surprisingly charming and eccentric comedy; a riff on common themes in the world of teenage romantic comedies but done so with a unique, entertaining style.:::1:::None
A sweet and slight and often charming coming-of-age tale.:::1:::4/5
Some may find such elements desperate or calculated in their quirky-cuteness, but I think they add to the movie's efforts to evoke the surrealism and excruciating intensity of, as the title puts it, youth in revolt.:::1:::4.5/5
The result is a brassy and unique production that might eventually land in the same cult classic territory as the C.D. Payne book it's based on.:::1:::B
Mildly diverting rather than uproarious, the film still stands out among teen sex comedies for its low-key approach to antic material.:::1:::None
Michael Cera and the rest of the cast lift Youth in Revolt beyond the cutesy pie piecemeal affectations. As a result, what could have been great is only marginally good.:::1:::3/5
This hormonally-charged teen comedy has one ace hiding up its sleeve %u2013 a brain.:::1:::3/4
It's an enjoyable enough exercise in teen angst triumphing.:::1:::3/5
It has all the hallmarks of a Michael Cera movie. This time out, though, Cera opens up his familiar whimsical-nerd character, inserts a grenade (well, a small grenade) and pulls the pin.:::1:::4/5
More of the same from Cera, and not terribly funny to boot.:::0:::2/4
Barely fresh, Youth in Revolt stars Michael Cera pretty much playing the same character he always plays. The first act was hilarious but then goes downhill.:::1:::2.5/5
A genial, shambling portrait of a first, obsessive infatuation.:::1:::7/10
"Yes, even smart, artistic and good boys are exploding with hormones at age sixteen.":::1:::B+

The heavy lifting falls to Cera, who can't quite carry the weight of his dual performance. - NERVE.COM:::0:::None
Oh, someone deliver us from boys and their self-entitlement, boys and their cluelessness, boys and their rage when male privilege fails to extend itself toward them in a manner they deem proper...:::0:::None
The two Michael Ceras interact like "The Parent Trap" on crack.:::1:::B
From The Catcher in the Rye to Rushmore, it's a story we've seen in better versions before.:::0:::2/4
It's not earth-shaking, but it's diverting and polished.:::1:::B
The studio's lackluster release will likely mean it'll thrive on DVD. Don't wait for that. Youth in Revolt is worth making a trip to the theaters.:::1:::None
Uneven but occasionally quite funny...:::1:::None
It's an amusing concept as far as it goes, although it doesn't go far enough.:::0:::2.5/4
Francois ultimately resembles every other character Cera has played, only with a mustache and a dirtier mouth. If he wants to show us what else he can do, he'll need to stage a much bigger rebellion than this.:::0:::2/5
Cera's Nick is like a lot of the actor's previous roles -- mild-mannered, smarter than everyone else -- but Cera's nimble performance keeps his frequently mean character from seeming mean.:::1:::3.5/4
It's a pleasant surprise to see the engaging, soft-spoken star of Superbad and Juno stretch and play a devil-may-care slimeball.:::1:::2.5/4
Finally reveals a new side of Cera that has been years and years in coming. It's nice to see that the kid has range, and range he has got.:::1:::A-
It's odd and fun watching Cera dip into this peculiar range of voguish deadpan profanity.:::1:::3/5
An improbable but hilarious combine of losin'-it comedies and the rarefied, Europhile air of the Cinema du Twee.:::1:::3.5/4
Michael Cera's probably not cut out to be a leading man, but if he's going to play the lead in your movie, then you'll need at least two of him. Maybe more.:::1:::3/5
Tries too hard to be quirky and fails.:::0:::2/4
Youth in Revolt has one of the most dishonest endings in recent memory, a conclusion that is not simply insincere, but a bold-faced lie that stands in opposition to every frame of film that has gone before it.:::0:::5/10
Parental Content Review:::1:::None
As one of the first releases of 2010, it is doubtful many viewers will remember Youth in Revolt by 2011.:::0:::2/4
It's fun to watch Cera put his own brand of hipster on and "Youth in Revolt" has a lot of funny moments, but Arteta's made an ungainly movie that ricochets around a lot and doesn't really add up to a whole lot.:::1:::B-
A picaresque booster shot of wily irreverence that puts a fresh, outrageous spin on adolescent obsession and rebellion...:::1:::B
The story congeals into a sometimes sweet and other times raucous comedy, yet also loses its grip.:::1:::3/5
It has a good heart, is well-made, and will definitely get the job done as a savior from the January doldrums that are bound to surface in the coming weeks.:::1:::B+
I laughed a fair bit. That's no ringing endorsement, but it's January.:::1:::2.5/4
Director Miguel Arteta, working from a tight script by Gustin Nash, tinges the mirth with malice. Sweet.:::1:::2.5/4
Youth in Revolt is basically an absurdist ramble, but a terrifically likable ramble with several stretches of lively farce...:::1:::None
This tale of a sex-crazed teen who invents a nasty alter-ego in a perverse bid to seduce his dream girl has too many unfunny moments to justify more than a rental...:::0:::2/4
Thanks to its dizzy comic style, Youth in Revolt is more than the standard coming-of-age comedy. It's silly, surreal and offers the best comic role for the deadpan Cera since Superbad.:::1:::3/4
Between delightful sequences of animation, vibrant performances by the likes of Justin Long, Fred Willard and Ray Liotta, and Arteta's mastery over comic tones ranging from the sensitive to the surreal, this is the rare movie one doesn't want to end.:::1:::3.5/4
It's Fight Club crossed with puberty.:::1:::B
your average Holden Caulfield fanatic will find his tale fun, but there's nothing much here that's new aside from facial hair on Cera:::0:::3/5
Although director Miguel Arteta's adaptation of C.D. Payne's cult-fave book series brings little new to the coming-of-age comedy genre, it's hard not to be beguiled by Youth in Revolt.:::1:::3/4
Perhaps this all works better on the printed page, where readers don't actually have to watch the character behave so rudely. (Or better before Cera rewrote much of the script.):::0:::2/4
While the preoccupation with teen sex is distasteful, the film also appears to be making a case that sincerity and genuineness are the way to a woman's heart.:::1:::3/4
There are some good, sharp, surprising laughs in Youth in Revolt. So why does it feel so dreadfully familiar?:::0:::2.5/4
Youth In Revolt is a little too clever and a little too willfully verbose for its own good, but it's rare and a little wonderful to see a comedy about the sex lives of teenagers that suffers from an excess of ideas and ambition instead of a dearth.:::1:::B-
The picture has enough charm to make us feel something for its shy, gangly protagonist, and enough bite to keep us from wanting to kill him.:::1:::None
As the precocious and nubile Sheeni Saunders, newcomer Portia Doubleday is the first major discovery of 2010.:::1:::4/5
Youth in Revolt follows what happens when a good kid turns hilariously rotten for the sake of love.:::1:::3/4
There's little to care about in Youth in Revolt, and even less to laugh with; the film lost in a stupor it never successfully navigates out of.:::0:::D+
The tone is sweetly raucous, the acting accomplished, and the directing occasionally inventive, but 'Youth in Revolt' contains few surprises.:::1:::None
Youth in Revolt is a delightful film that makes no apologies for its irreverence. It's also the first great comedy of this decade.:::1:::4/4
By its end Youth in Revolt has flown off the tracks completely.:::0:::3/5
It's not that the film is fatally flawed, but the tone is uneven, the satire is blunt, the comedy rarely generates more than feeble laughs, and the lead character never comes fully to life.:::0:::2.5/4
The filmmakers try really hard to be hip and inventive but aren't. Steve Buscemi, Fred Willard, and M. Emmet Walsh are among the indie casualties.:::0:::1/4
Cera's style lends itself to one note, and the movie wisely gives him another character to play, an imaginary alter ego named Francois Dillinger, inspired by Jean-Paul Belmondo.:::1:::3/4
Areta's film has whimsy and a few great lines, but not enough originality.:::0:::None
There's a genial throwback feel to the movie's style that recalls scrappy sex comedies of the 1980s.:::1:::3/5
Despite Cera's consderable charm, the alternately scruffy and diffident tone that Arteta and Nash bring to the material leave it feeling both forced and limp.:::0:::C
Doubleday's Sheeni is charming, smart and pretty and has just that hint of knowing danger that drives teenage boys insane. And Cera? No one does this kind of thing better, which is presumably why he keeps doing it.:::1:::3.5/5
Truth is, there's also too much &#8232; Michael Cera. Which isn't the star's fault. I blame the movie's bad timing, and its delayed release.:::0:::C+
"Punk" and "rebel" don't belong in the same sentence with "Michael Cera." But somehow, they connect in the few-holds-barred teen comedy Youth in Revolt.:::1:::2.5/4
Nash and director Miguel Arteta try too hard; they want their movie branded a cult favorite before anyone's even seen it.:::0:::None
But even apart from the film's vaguely insane endorsement of love at all costs, there's the fact that much of it is simply not very funny.:::0:::2/4
Light, comic, and less black than the books, this is a fun piece of fluff that melts away like cotton candy.:::1:::3/5
Has a strong Dickensian flavor, blending slapstick with social satire...You'll laugh at Cera's off-rhythm delivery and casual sharpness wrapped in the softest possible tones.:::1:::None
This quirky dark comedy offers you 90 minutes of [Michael Cera] not just doing what he does best but also showing that he has a few new tricks up his sleeve.:::1:::8/10
Cera's scenes with Ray Liotta, as a local cop dating Nick's mom, are priceless. He may not be Holden Caufield, but in this day and age Nick represents a fresh breeze of youthful rebellion.:::1:::B
This red state versus blue state daringly offbeat chucklefest elevates that notorious dumb and dumber genre known as teen comedy, into fresh and verbally tangy territory. Enough so, to easily earn this movie informal bragging rights as Juno II.:::1:::None
The frustrations of puppy love are on greatly entertaining display.:::1:::A-
It's a kick to see Cera cut loosey since anything with Arnett -- one of the funniest around -- is typically worth the price of admission.:::0:::None
All in all, Bell and Duhamel (gee, that rhymes!) are not tearing down any barriers, but it's clear that they're having fun and their chemistry is palpable. I wouldn't be opposed to seeing them team up again.:::1:::2.5/4
Kristen Bell, in the silly romantic comedy When in Rome, has the wry perkiness of a 20-something Sarah Jessica Parker, and you sit through the movie wondering what she might do with better material than this.:::0:::2/4
Alone among the cast, Duhamel overcame the drivel. He's not in that many scenes but if the film has any bright spot, it's Josh.:::0:::1/10
Even in the avalanche of terrible Hollywood romantic comedies, this one is particularly inane.:::0:::D
Despite the considerable charms of stars Kristen Bell and Josh Duhamel, When in Rome doesn't quite work, in either the love or laughter departments.:::0:::2/4
Though not as ultra-cliched as its title, When in Rome follows the predictable conventions of the genre.:::0:::2/4
The screechy Bell has the delicate charm of a scraped blackboard; the dully handsome Duhamel looks like a Land's End catalog come to fitful life.:::0:::1/4
If someone taught classes on how not to make a romantic comedy, When in Rome would most certainly be one of the examples they would use.:::0:::1/4
Do as the Romans do. Drive around it.:::0:::1/4
When in Rome is a rom-bomb.:::0:::1/4
Please, Gods of Love, make this movie disappear.:::0:::1/4
When in Rome operates on the assumption that if three coins in the fountain are good, five should be that much better. Alas, three was plenty...:::0:::D
one of those romantic comedies that's compelled to spell everything out for its audience at 10 minute intervals:::0:::2.5/5
Johnson doesn't know how to sell funny, so he plays everything in the most obvious, siren-wail fashion, deploying an atrocious supporting cast to volcanically ham it up while Bell blinks and fidgets and Duhamel plays confused convincingly:::0:::F
Entertaining, full of laughs and, as far as chick flicks go, is a sweet, romantic trip worth taking for audiences so inclined.:::1:::3/5
Notice the ads don't proudly proclaim, 'From the writers of Old Dogs':::0:::1.5/5
A weak rehash of Love Potion No. 9, with Love Potion No. 9 replaced by crack.:::0:::1/4
Bell, a petite, pretty blonde, may or may not have the Meg Ryan-Julia Roberts-Sandra Bullock goods. When in Rome, a leaden variation on that rom-com recipe, fails utterly to make her case.:::0:::1.5/4

This propaganda style doc is too busy evoking intolerance (ironically) and fear mongering to provoke any rational analysis of the facts.:::0:::D
The film's powerful correlative lesson? That citizen journalism will play an important role in outing big-money political players who would like to silently put their stamp on laws from the capitalistic safety of the shadows.:::1:::B
From the hard facts of the church's PR wrangling and shady financial reporting, to the human fallout of their treatment of gays both inside and outside their flock, the filmmakers hammer hard on the Mormon church.:::1:::7/10
The film also fails to take into account the many other factors in play during the 2008 election, narrowing events down to one all-encompassing Mormon-based explanation. 8 means well, but is too blinded by its own biases to do its cause justice.:::0:::4.0/10
The thing the film does best is to put a human face on the issue, to show us individuals (and couples) who were directly affected by the passing of Prop 8.:::1:::3/4
Provocative and disturbing.:::1:::3/4
It's marred by loaded language and a propagandistic tone that undercuts rather than promotes its purposes.:::0:::2/4
[Cowan] expands his sad and furious homegrown film to record the misery of gay Mormons sometimes driven to suicide over being rejected by their church and families.:::1:::B-

An impassioned piece of timely agitprop.:::1:::None
No matter what your stand is on gay marriage, you're bound to come out with a broader definition of family values.:::1:::4/5
The highly emotional documentary is narrated by Dustin Lance Black, the screenwriter for Milk, who, like Mr. Cowan, is gay and grew up in a Mormon household.:::1:::3/5
Instead of stooping to the level of Focus on the Family's misleading Prop. 8 ads, the pic damns the LDS Church not with lies, but with their own words.:::1:::None
Combining investigative reporting with personal experience, Reed Cowan's impassioned documentary is unlikely to leave many dry eyes among its audience.:::1:::4/5
8: The Mormon Proposition becomes a vital, important cry for an open dialogue. It's unfortunate that one side still refuses to come to the table.:::1:::3.5/4
The lack of polish doesn't tarnish the truth of the story: how an institution claiming to speak for God turned its dogma into law, and shattered the lives of real, loving people in the process.:::1:::3/4
A compelling look at how the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints operates in the political arena, even if audiences come away knowing that writer-producer-director Reed Cowan has told the story from his biased point of view.:::1:::3.5/5
A great cautionary tale.:::1:::None
A hard-hitting expose of a shameful episode.:::1:::3/4
As an expose, there could hardly be a stronger case for ensuring and strengthening the separation of church and state -- or a stronger message to gay people as to the magnitude of the challenge to win equal rights.:::1:::4/5
An expose of the Mormon Church's involvement in an anti-gay crusade fueled by hatred and a rigid defense of family values.:::1:::4/5
Lamentably dry in its execution despite an almost nonstop flow of tears.:::0:::7/10
It seems impossible that anyone will have their minds changed or even piqued by watching this film. No one will really listen to The Mormon Proposition because we've heard it all before.:::0:::None
It's as if the filmmakers went into the project without a specific direction, aside from making an obvious statement. The resulting movie feels rambling and unfocused.:::0:::None
It's so one-sided you hardly care after a while that the side it's on is so clearly the right one.:::0:::2/4

Cowan and Greenstreet are preaching to the choir.:::0:::None
The movie is shrill even by adv from his patented befuddled-nerd routine, even if the film's caricatured performances and fish-in-a-barrel scorn are sure to be monotonous for some.:::1:::3/5
In a dual role, as a quitely rebellious outsider and as his wilder alter ego, Michael Cera renders enormously charming performances that elevate this coming of age comedy way above its familiar subject and conventional secondary characters.:::1:::B+
Director Miguel Arteta can't quite keep all the balls in the air long enough to sustain the film's running time, but he does manage a bang-up ending that's worth the wait.:::1:::None
Michael Cera, practically the poster-child for this strain of hip comedies, plays yet another awkward teen looking to win the girl, but like the film itself, he's spinning his wheels a bit.:::0:::None

"The Book of Eli" falls prey to several of the problems that "The Road" had, and while it wasn't as big a failure as that film, it's still a lot of apocalyptic wasteland to get through.:::0:::2/4
The ending of this film has got to be the longest ending in the history of cinema.:::0:::2/5
The Hughes brothers' film feels more vibrant than the bleak Road, which was launched at us in November. Here the brothers show us the horror but somehow the staid and calm Denzel feels more approachable than the distraught and scrambling Viggo.:::1:::B+
I sat down to The Book of Eli expecting a lecture, and was instead treated to a rollicking action film that evoked the manic ultra-violence of Mad Max rather than the sensitive study of humanity of The Road.:::1:::3.5/5

A crackpot blend of sadism and scriptures, and reeking with the raw scent of a fanatical fundamentalism in cool video game clothing.:::0:::None

Washington is always watchable and will hold your gaze during a highly ambitious but ultimately wonky attempt to inject spiritual depth into the blockbuster flock.:::0:::None

The Book of Eli opens with Denzel Washington's Eli murdering a cat, but by the end it's the film that has really screwed the pooch.:::0:::1/5
In its limpid simplicity and stock portrayals of good and evil characters, it has a forward momentum that's compelling.:::1:::None
At last, an action movie even the Pope can love.:::1:::3/5
Directors Allen and Albert Hughes stage some impressive set-pieces, including intricately choreographed fights and a stunning shoot-out covered by a single rotating camera.:::1:::3/4
Gary Whitta's script seems set out to mimic the contours of a religious parable. It has simplicity, sweep, incredible last minute plot twists, mystical happenings and a fundamental belief in Faith.:::1:::3/5
Though The Book of Eli devolves into a very basic series of pitched battles between the good and evil adversaries, the film does exert a tight grip on the viewer.:::1:::3/4
Gripping and thought provoking entertainment.:::1:::None
Are we really supposed to believe that an iPod's battery life will outlast religion?:::0:::2/5
A sense of heavy handed earnestness weigh the film down, with meaningful close ups of Denzel's determined and decent face. He is doing God's work. And God has armed him well; the sense of deja vu is heightened by the entire production design and CGI:::0:::None
Unless you go into the film with low expectations, you'll probably walk out wishing the Hughes brothers disappeared for another nine years.:::0:::2.5/5
It is nice to know that even after the apocalypse, people will still be listening to Al Green.:::0:::None

Hey, it's Denzel. But, unfortunately he's caught in a post-apocalyptic thriller pieced together from so many other films. The radiation has apparently gone to his brain. Paul Chambers, CNN.:::0:::D
Yes, it's another post-apocalyptic movie. But it stands on its own as a gripping, entertaining story with a couple of nifty twists.:::1:::3/4
Finally a post apocalyptic tale that offers everything you want and expect!:::1:::4/5
As a testament to the importance of the written word in its lowercase and uppercase meanings, THE BOOK OF ELI makes for an odd but compelling action film in defense of literacy and Christian faith.:::1:::B
Presents an interesting case for the post-apocalyptic film as the re-birth of the western, but beyond that it's pretty dumb.:::0:::5/10

Butt-kicking prophet of God Denzel Washington wanders an ashy wasteland in this Mad-to-the-Max post-apocalyptic Western...:::1:::3/4

Washington doesn't look as if he's having much fun, and who can blame him?:::0:::3/5
The Book Of Eli is directed by the Hughes Brothers. On this evidence, they've got about as much movie-making talent as the Chuckle Brothers. Their last film was From Hell. Guess what? So is this one.:::0:::2/5
While the samurai stuff is super cool, the Bible business is preposterous.:::0:::2/5

On a technical level, The Book of Eli is smooth and assured.:::1:::3/5
It's been quite a good long while since I can recall a post-apocalyptic film to invent so very little and to rip off the Mad Max movies quite so happily.:::0:::3/10
I hope the Hughes Brothers abandon these wannabe Hollywood glamor flicks and go back to gritty, raw dramas -- like 'Dead Presidents' and 'Menace II Society' -- that made their work so fresh and groundbreaking.:::0:::C-
You'll probably walk out wishing the Hughes brothers disappeared for another nine years.:::0:::2.5/5
a curious twist on the postapocalyptic genre that keeps all the desolate visual trappings but uses them in the service of an overtly religious narrative that hinges on the transcendence of belief:::1:::3/4
I'm not going to give it away, but there's a final plot twist in this movie that is beyond absurd.:::0:::None
The movie occasionally teeters on greatness, especially from a visual standpoint, but nearly every brilliant moment is countered by five boneheaded errors.:::0:::None
With an appealing Western vibe, its fair share of dazzling set-pieces and some interesting ideas bubbling beneath the surface, Eli defies lazy dismissal as Hollywood's version of The Road.:::1:::3/5
The film's somewhat religious plot appears creative and intriguing as does the mysterious man who carries the book.:::1:::3.5/5

Without a second viewing I'm actually not sure if talking about it will simply drive me nuts or impress me more. I'm leaning toward nuts.:::1:::6/10
The movie entwines itself in a pedestrian chase-oriented narrative that drags along before descending into irredeemably inexplicable silliness.:::0:::2.5/4
Water and Chap Stick may be difficult to come by in the post-apocalyptic world of The Book of Eli, but ammunition certainly is not.:::1:::B-
Despite Denzel Washington turning in a trademark, charismatic performance underscored by appropriately monochromatic cinematography, the film is still surprisingly unengaging.:::0:::1/4
Drab and solemn, it's yet another post-apocalyptic drama, delivering bloodshed that's punctuated by poetic psalms.:::0:::6/10
The Hughes brothers struggle with keeping the story intact and characters engaging but they do know how to shoot action with flair.:::0:::2.5/5
Not long into the production the words get uttered that turn a stylish, well-done, well-acted production to predictable mush. The words: "In the time before%u2026":::0:::3/5
The R-rated mayhem shows imagination and flair, extrapolated from interesting ideas that poke into corners of this genre we haven't seen before.:::1:::B
Rejoice, Hollywood has made a movie that the Religious Right can like - if you take away the blood and gore. It's nice to know my iPod will work in a post apocalyptic world.:::1:::A-
If quickly edited dismemberment, misogyny, and commercialized spirituality, all enacted to an annoying score composed by Atticus Ross, is your cup of tea, drink up.:::0:::4/10
This adrenaline-fueled cross between The Road Warrior and The Ten Commandments gets a tad heavy-handed at times.:::0:::2/4
Overstays its welcome and feels preposterous, sophomoric, pretentious and barely engaging thanks to the talents of Denzel Washington & Gary Oldman. It might make for a great midnight movie to laugh at given its abundance of absurdity & mindless violence.:::0:::4.5/10
Denzel Washington does the best he can with the material, but "The Book of Eli" is so ingrained with over-stylization, self-indulgence and ridiculous thematic material that it had no chance of succeeding from frame one.:::0:::D
There are a handful of moments that shine, but Eli is forgettable nonetheless.:::0:::5/10
The Book of Eli gives us some of that old time religion - along with a heaping helping of violence.:::1:::3/4
The Book of Eli has something extremely thoughtful to say and it was designed to make you think about what it is saying. This film grew on me in a big way.:::1:::3/4
The surprise ending almost matches the denouement of The Sixth Sense as an audience grabber.:::1:::3/4
"The Book of Eli" is a movie that attains perfection, of a sort -- it's perfectly ridiculous.:::0:::1/5
Denzel Washington deserves equal credit for this, delivering his best Man with No Name impression as a Bible-thumping hero in a much more literal sense, one who delivers bloody vengeance in lieu of sermons. Though these types of roles are far more demandi:::1:::6/10
This vivid world created by 'The Book of Eli' quickly collapses, like a pile of dry sand. And as the film settles into increasingly unlikely action sequences and a standard-issue chase, the second half proves to be nowhere near as thrilling as the first.:::0:::2/4
The deity on high who has sent Eli on his mission works in mysterious ways that become more mysterious, and more blood-soaked, as the flick drones on and on and on and on:::0:::1/5

Really, it's just another prophet-in-the-wilderness tale -- not nearly as bad as those trailers would suggest, yet neither will your soul run any risk of enlightenment.:::0:::2/4

Allen and Albert Hughes have created a plausible post-apocalyptic world.:::1:::3/5

What strength and intensity the movie musters begins and ends with Washington.:::1:::3.5/5
There hasn't been too many action films with a Christian overtone as the two genres don't necessarily go hand in hand, but the vastly entertaining 'The Book of Eli,' shows that fancy swordplay/shootouts and faith don't have to be mutually exclusive.:::1:::4/5
It hurts to say this because I was hoping I wouldn't have to type "post-apocalyptic" for awhile, but who knew Denzel would make it worth the trip?:::1:::3.5/5
Denzel wants to kick some boo-tay! I just wish they worked a bit harder on the script.:::1:::2.5/4
Although it feels like a parallel story taking place at the same time as THE ROAD, this post-apocalyptic thriller has the opposite effect, actually getting less complex and interesting as it goes along. At least it starts out well.:::0:::2.5/5
Mad Max 2 with Thought for the Day thrown in. There's some ace post-holocaust action, but you can't help feel you were invited to a party with fizzy pop and cream cake and got suckered into a sermon instead.:::0:::2/5
think of this as The Road if re-imagined by the Wachowski Brothers. The landscape is all grays and browns, punctuated only by the occasional flash of a muzzle.:::1:::2.5/4
He is Eli. He carries a Bible with him that no one is allowed to touch. He's got a burning rage on his face that says Team Conan.:::0:::2.5/4
It's as if someone who saw last week's apocalyptic drama The Road said, "Let's do it again, but this time let's make it rubbish".:::0:::2/5
Despite the impressively atmospheric opening sequences the Hugheses allow their film to lurch into inspirational-literature territory - and it ends up dissipating the brooding, cryptic atmosphere of its opening scenes.:::0:::2/5
The Hughes Brothers intend this doomily pompous multiplex-filler as a futuristic western, but its feet are firmly planted in a big bucket of po-faced messianic cement. You wonder what Washington saw in it.:::0:::3/5
These are two guys who know how to make a movie. They may not be perfect ones, but one can't deny it is not for a lack of effort.:::1:::3/4
The more I think about this film, the more I love it. Book of Eli packs such a punch at the end that you will want to see it again to see if you catch certain details.:::1:::4/5
This is one book worth watching.:::1:::None
Even though it's at least the fourth movie in the past six months to show us life after the apocalypse, Eli's vision is bracingly original: It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel like some popcorn.:::1:::4/4
The Book of Eli is one of those frustrating films that could be so much better if it simplified its story. Unfortunately the contradictions are too evident to ignore and as a result all of the good elements are completely outweighed.:::0:::None
Doing for Christianity what Battlefield Earth did for Scientology, The Book Of Eli is an ill-conceived, preachy leaden dud that's painfully pretentious and deserves to limp off the cinema screens in a mercifully swift time. Avoid.:::0:::1/5
A movie weighed down by a numbskull screenplay (by rookie Gary Whitta) and a careless lack of attention to details.:::0:::2/4
Not your usual post-apocalyptic fare then. Even if it does get a bit daft towards the end (thanks, Malcolm McDowell) this is superior action fare, neatly shot and whip-lashingly edited.:::1:::3/5
For those of us in the reading and writing business-for anyone, really, who loves the written word-the movie has a powerful resonance. It reminds us that literacy can't be taken for granted.:::1:::None
You'd expect The Book of Eli to offer something special enough to have lured the brothers from retirement, but the Hugheses settle for serving up all the usual cliches...:::0:::1/4
The filmmakers have an unusually persuasive star in Washington, who can sell lines like, "We had more than we needed" and "I walk by faith, not by sight.":::1:::2.5/4
Denzel's latest is a sluggish affair weighed down by its lofty themes. It also comes with a preposterous twist and a paying-the-rent performance from Oldman that's pure cured ham.:::0:::2/5
A hyper-violent, post-apocalyptic Western in the mold of Mad Max that can't make up its mind whether it wants to be corny or misanthropic.:::1:::2.5/4
Ponderously paced and surely the final nail in the coffin of its once-promising directors, Albert and Allen Hughes, this is an extremely dumb film with absurd pretensions to spiritual significance.:::0:::0/5
The problem is a ho-hum storyline that feels as if it's been strapped to a rack and stretched to breaking point.:::0:::3/5
This is more style over content and it drags towards the end. But as a slice of Friday night escapism, I'd see-li The Book Of Eli.:::1:::3/5
Bad enough to be an end-of-genre movie... The script is a calamity, the direction worse.:::0:::1/5
Just how badly does this guy want beatification? Perhaps someone should remind him that the Book in question mentions vanity as a sin.:::0:::1/5
This po-faced adventure has more in common with the Kevin Costner clinker The Postman than anything touched by the hand of a Pulitzer prize-winning novelist.:::0:::None
Though they provide us with a fair number of fight scenes, explosions and suchlike, the Hughes brothers clearly think they are also Saying Something Important. The result is like The Road rewritten by Sarah Palin for the greater good of Alaska and mankind:::0:::2/5
As post-apocalyptic thrillers go, The Book of Eli lacks the emotional depth of The Road but it's worth seeing for both the performances and the impressive fight sequences.:::1:::3/5
Its loopiness is fervent, but the Hugheses really do know how to move the camera, and Gary Whitta's script offers up a steady parade of fanboy treats.:::1:::3/5
Denzel's Eli is one of those characters who, when he faces off against the hundred enemies, makes you feel bad for the hundred.:::1:::7/10
It's shot with style, and the story has enough thrills and dark humor to justify one two-hour trip into the desolate future.:::1:::B
A decent action-adventure flick aided greatly by its charismatic star.:::1:::B
Brain-roasting entertainment!:::1:::3/5
A kickass piece of contemporary entertainment.:::1:::3/5
Powerful and thought-provoking. A forecast for our time.:::1:::None
Remember how, when you were watching The Road, you thought to yourself, "This needs more kung fu and Jesus"? God, and the Hughes brothers, heard your prayers.:::1:::B
Your brain, and, yes, your soul, long for ... a film that walked either the straight and narrow path of righteousness or blazed some new trail instead of frustratingly sticking with such faith and fervor to the middle of the road.:::0:::2.5/5
Parental Content Review:::1:::None
The Book of Eli has its attributes, not the least being its ability to present religious themes into the mix without getting preachy or spelling out a specific moral stance. What is lacking, then, is its humanity.:::0:::2/4

One trip to the poisoned post-apocalyptic well too many:::0:::2/5
Suffers mainly from simplicity.:::0:::2.5/4
Poetic psalms uttered amid stylized violence are disconcerting. Religion and bloodshed, though linked through much of history, make queasy entertainment partners.:::0:::2/4
Travolta had his Battlefield Earth, Costner had his Waterworld and now Denzel Washington has his truly awful sci-fi epic, The Book of Eli.:::0:::1.5/4
While the religious content makes itself felt, sometimes strongly, the heavy action quotient -- the story of Eli the slasher -- tears feelings to tatters.:::0:::None
A dynamic story, sprinkled with some interesting ideas about the preciousness of culture and how societies might rebuild themselves.:::1:::3/4
The Hughes Brothers may want us to think they're giving us a few deep, quasi-spiritual ideas, but what they're really serving up is earnestly shallow, machete-and-bow-and-arrow entertainment.:::0:::None
The story sort of plays like a thrill-ride version of The Road, with healthier-looking cannibals and a sillier ending.:::0:::C+
The Hughes brothers should thank God for Denzel, who almost singlehandedly makes Book of Eli's hyper-stylized, incongruous mixture of B-movie splatter and high-minded spiritual hokum palpable:::1:::3/5
The Book of Eli isn't as exciting or funny or inspiring as it wants and needs to be, and its preachy ending is an ordeal. But Washington, a movie star who can act, is one cool dude who is worth following anywhere.:::0:::2.5/4
You'd want a guy like Denzel around when the end is nigh. Too bad The Book of Eli is so preachy it buries the subtlety he brings forth.:::0:::2.5/5
A gorgeously illustrated picture-book of landscapes made barren by politicized religion, where faith is salvation's last frontier.:::1:::3/4
...a decent enough entertainment, but its story and imagery are all too familiar, there are jarring geographical impossibilities, and costarring Mila Kunis seems out of her depth against the likes of Washington and Oldman.:::0:::C
The fixation on the Bible (and biblical-scale cloud formations) gets awfully pompous at times, especially when it's used to justify gory dismemberments.:::0:::2/4
It feels a bit confused. And an unconvincing, contrived final third or so of the movie proves to be its ultimate undoing.:::0:::2/4
The Book of Eli is The Road with twice the plot, four times the ammunition, and half the brains; it'll probably make 10 times the money.:::0:::2/4
Eli is nothing less than a prophet-superman on a divine mission, and while he naturally saves the word of God and, thus, humanity at large, he's powerless to salvage the film from its derivativeness.:::0:::1.5/4
Washington, ever potent, brings to the role the full force of his thousand-mile stare and regenerative smile.:::1:::3/4
Who better than Denzel to play a saint in a sinful world, a man who retains this saintliness even after he's sliced up several dozen rapists and cannibals?:::1:::B-
Working from a script by Gary Whitta, the Hughes brothers, Albert and Allen, have made a stark affirmation of faith as a guiding light for a broken, lawless civilization, but to their credit, the film stops well short of proselytizing.:::1:::B
Before it loses its way in the home stretch, the Hughes Brothers' take on the post-apocalyptic genre makes for gripping entertainment.:::1:::None
remarkably straightforward but appropriately quirky:::1:::3.5/5
With riveting action that never stops, The Book of Eli gets the year off to a spectacularly exciting start at the movies and should keep turnstiles turning.:::1:::3.5/5
Bold and innovative, spiritually challenging--and some heads get chopped off.:::1:::4.5/5
The sepia-toned palette gets a little wearying, but the dialogue is hilarious, the violence is crunchy, and cameos by Tom Waits and topflight Brit character actor Michael Gambon are worth the ticket price alone.:::1:::None
The Book of Eli doesn't quite achieve the greatness to which it so clearly aspires. But how many sci-fi flicks have Al Green on the soundtrack?:::1:::3/4
Despite its leaps in logic, The Book of Eli isn't all bad. Watching Denzel Washington deliver yet another outstanding performance is greatly entertaining.:::1:::B-
The first major action film of 2010 is more pensive and lyrical than advertised.:::1:::None
Another lone traveler wanders another post-apocalyptic landscape. This time, he carries a book. Who is this man and what's with the book? If that question is enough to keep you interested for two hours, you're all set.:::0:::2/4
Shot on nimble, lightweight Red digital cameras, the film may traffic in familiar landscapes and archetypes, but it allows its cast the space and time to make the characters breathe.:::1:::3/4
Either the apocalypse is coming soon or Hollywood is kind of over-preparing.:::0:::2.5/5
I'm at a loss for words, so let me say these right away: The Book of Eli is very watchable. You won't be sorry you went.:::1:::3/4
The problem with The Book of Eli is that the narrative isn't a match for its sentiments. The script feels like it's an iteration or two short of a final draft.:::0:::2.5/4
Like a cross between The Road Warrior and "Deadwood" ... a generic post-Apocalypse movie with a few cool action scenes and a mostly ridiculous premise.:::0:::5.5/10
Would have been the best movie of 2009 if it had come out a month ago. You won't see a more compelling movie all year.:::1:::None
Nothing novel or unpredictable, despite an unnecessary twist at the conclusion: at least it's more entertaining than 'The Road.':::0:::C
A wacky piece of pseudo-religious twaddle dressed up as a solemn, silly post-apocalyptic action flick.:::0:::F
All of it is held together by a creepy combination of Christian fundamentalism and Old Testament fire and brimstone.:::1:::2.5/4
Truly, if one must wander a barren, post-apocalyptic landscape with somebody, who better to wander with than Denzel Washington?:::1:::3.5/5
A ponderous dystopian bummer that might be described as The Road Warrior without car chases, or The Road without humanity.:::0:::D
It's obvious what the book is and the resolution to this quest tale is silly beyond belief. Denzel just plays it quiet, tough and cool, as if that alone will carry the film.:::0:::2/4
The Book of Eli, yet another apocalyptic fantasy, suggests that Denzel Washington has become America's dullest actor.:::0:::None
Ready or not: here it comes. The first kick ass apocalyptic action flick, designed for both the comic book and True Believer set. Well, you can't say this decade in movies hasn't started out with a bang!:::1:::None
No explanation is ever given for Eli's miraculous resiliency, except that he is eventually presented as a kind of prophet whose message might simply be that all good-hearted survivors should walk the earth carrying a copy of the bible. I suppose, in the f:::0:::C+
Denzel Washington is an actor who makes his own gravitas. Even the great Denzel must surrender to his his inability to make spiritualist silliness seem serious.:::0:::None

If you're expecting action, you'll be disappointed to find mostly empty religious propaganda.:::0:::2/5
The rest of the rote splatter-violence has Denzel whirlwind lopping off heads through philistine hordes, sequences only good for insight into what PS3 games the Hugheses were playing in pre-production.:::0:::None
In the future, according to The Book of Eli, we'll all dress like we're in a Nine Inch Nails video. It is written.:::0:::None
An absurd, incoherent narrative, defined by several contradictions: it's religious and violent, arty and exploitational, serious and trashy, stylized and gritty.:::0:::C-
Iconically effective as a single-minded messenger with a mission, Washington's Eli is ultimately too confined by the man-of-few-words movie norms he's saddled with.:::0:::None
The Book Of Eli is a post-apocalyptic western cursed by laborious pacing and a sense oocacy-doc standards.:::0:::None
Preaching to the converted, a sobering but formulaic study of church activism against gay rights is more therapeutic than astute.:::0:::2/4
The Mormon Proposition is about as subjective as documentaries get. The good news is that Cowan and Greenstreet are compelling enough to convince you that only one side of this debate deserves a voice.:::1:::3.5/4
The filmmakers fail to settle on one approach, so the disparate parts of this far-too-short feature (it's barely a Dateline special) cancel one another out.:::0:::2/5
Cowan strikes a potent balance between heart and head, juxtaposing emotionally wrenching moments with self-damning portraits of Mormon politicians and church officials, and hard-nosed journalism from reporter Fred Karger.:::1:::None
A broadside against the Mormon Church for helping to pass California's anti-gay Proposition 8, though some levity would increase its entertainment value.:::1:::B

Death at a Funeral never quite hits the farcical heights it's aiming for, but it's still got plenty going for it, thanks to an excellent cast and experienced direction.:::1:::7/10
When turned loose on accessible, not altogether-insincere dark-comedy scenarios, Frank Oz understands humor at a molecular level of structure, volume and timing. An impossible last-shot stinger aside, "Death at a Funeral" is farce at its most flawless.:::1:::3.5/4
Lazy comedy, and it's only made passable mainly by its manic cast and pace.:::0:::4/10
Despite a final half hour that's full of laughs, Death takes so long getting its farce gears moving that the audience becomes comatose with anticipation of mirth that is too late in coming.:::0:::None

This Funeral won't leave audiences in a mournful state.:::1:::2.5/4
A fine British cast is wasted on feeble material.:::0:::None
Death at a Funeral has a great cast and a suitably chaotic plot but it's never quite as funny as it thinks it is.:::0:::2/5
In the end the knockabout humour totally destroys the glimmers of spiteful sophistication which would have made it much funnier.:::0:::2/5
Take away the Four Weddings and you get this dismal Brit-com.:::0:::1/5
You'll wince and fidget and groan, and finally wonder at the nerve of the film-makers who thought they could get away with this.:::0:::1/5
I hear the script was funny, which is hard to believe: this is grim, misjudged and seems to go on for ever.:::0:::None
A staggeringly inept farce.:::0:::None
Scientists believe that black holes can slow down the progress of time. A similar effect can be felt by viewers of this damp squib of a farce as it grinds on from one lame set-up to the next.:::0:::2/5
As funny as losing a finger.:::0:::2/5
A pleasantly unpleasant comedy that belatedly delivers. You won't die laughing but you shouldn't expire from boredom either.:::1:::3/5
A farce - but not in the way its makers intended.:::0:::0/5
An apologetic-looking cast treads gingerly over the resulting wreckage, though only the guy in the coffin emerges with his credibility intact.:::0:::1/5
A patchy but silly caper that will be dead funny (sorry) for anyone who's recently wrestled with family hysteria. Perfect pre-Christmas fare then.:::1:::3/5
Scatological grue, nudity, swearing, drug-taking and the chance to watch two grown men wrestle a midget...:::1:::3/6

A sole potty joke is unnecessarily crass, but for the most part this is joyfully funny.:::1:::3/5
For farce to work well, the plotting needs to be watertight, whereas here the sheer excess of characters fails entirely to cover up this film's flimsy underpinnings.:::0:::None

Goofy burial digs up family secrets; not for kids.:::1:::3/5
Death at a Funeral might have been made in the 1960s, not to be released until well past its stale date.:::0:::1.5/4
The film begins with a vaguely tired joke, but this just makes what follows that much more delicious.:::1:::3.5/5
Weighing in at a brisk 90 minutes, the picture does have the advantage of brevity, and on screen no less than off, there's much to be said for a quick send-off.:::1:::2.5/4
Very funny and entertaining, a sometimes-dark comedy somewhere between Four Weddings and a Funeral and Meet the Parents.:::1:::3/4
A total misfire from director Frank Oz, whose endeavours to deliver black humour wobbles fatally. With its excellent British cast, it's not all bad, but the plot is hackneyed, the tone is wrong, and what aspires to be funny leaves us embarrassed:::0:::None
It's a British comedy that shows the minor miracles that can be performed with a cast of (mostly) British actors, a drawing room, and a funny idea.:::1:::B+
I nearly died laughing.:::1:::4/5
Once everything is finally in place, Death at a Funeral springs to comedic life with such speed and assurance that it's hard to complain.:::1:::4/5
The stench of desperation wafts from the screen, as Craig and Oz randomly grasp at one hackneyed device after another ...:::0:::None

The comedy doesn't have much to say, but its humor is killer.:::1:::4/4
Writer Dean Craig creates a beautifully intricate farce, and it's how the interlocking pieces snap together that provide much of the mirth, rather than the sometimes stale gags along the way.:::1:::2.5/4
The movie is not always laugh-out-loud funny, but at least it never becomes tiresome or aggravating -- and that's more than a lot of comedies can say.:::1:::B-
Death at a Funeral has almost no delightful machinations, no consistency of tone, no relatable characters, and worst of all, no funny jokes.:::0:::1/5

This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen... [It's] practically Shakespearean in its exquisite foolishness and comedic intrigue...:::1:::None
There's no time to catch your breath; Death at a Funeral is that funny.:::1:::4/5
Thanks to its finely honed timing, hilarious one-liners, quirky characters and non-stop laughs, 'Death at a Funeral' is enormously funny.:::1:::None
I'm all for a good poop joke but just getting pooped on isn't itself funny. Especially when they spend the whole movie setting up the old guy and he needs help with the bathroom. Might as well send a telegraph.:::0:::None
While trying so hard to have such a good time, the movie simply forgets to be funny, and begins to grate before the body even cools.:::0:::2/4
A refreshingly small, self-contained low-budget comedy in which Dean Craig's clever script is the primary attraction and scene-stealer Peter Dinklage is the biggest star.:::1:::B
Insanely funny, if occasionally out-of-control, black farce.:::1:::None
A heartless film in which dozens of selfish people don't care at all about the dead guy, which allows us to laugh instead of, you know, grieving.:::1:::3.5/4
Screenwriter Dean Craign exhibits a real feel for the way that a crisis brings out age-old hostilities. Craig uses humor as a cover-up to say something about the way families pull apart as well as together at difficult times.:::1:::4/4
As dumb and redundant as its wink-wink title. Devoid of the charm and wit that's become the hallmark of so many British ensemble comedies, it feels more like some frantic, door-slamming stage farce than an actual movie.:::0:::2.5/4
Sporadically funny, but for the most part, Death is just thoroughly modest.:::0:::C
It takes a while for Frank Oz's ensemble black comedy Death at a Funeral to hit its deliriously nutty stride. But when it does, the laughs don't stop until the movie, like the subject of its family get-together, has taken its last breath.:::1:::3/4
Even at a brisk 90 minutes, though, the show begins to feel like a memorial that has dragged on too long. Comedy plus bad timing equals disappointment.:::0:::2/4
Struggles valiantly to be funny but is mostly dead on arrival.:::0:::2/4
Death builds slowly and inexorably to a comic explosion that's just too good -- too insanely, impossibly mortifying -- to spoil here.:::1:::2.5/4

Death at a Funeral stands apart from other movies with rude humor because its characters are determined to keep a stiff upper lip no matter what.:::1:::4/5
Death at a Funeral finds its comedy in the peculiar human trait of being most tempted to laugh when we're absolutely not supposed to.:::1:::3/4

A slow burn that snowballs into a rip-roaring and veddy British climax. Very enjoyable! Please read review.:::1:::4.5/5
Set among the perpetually polite and embarrassed British, the film is at least tolerable.:::0:::2/4

'Wrong' is the operative word with Death at a Funeral, which in the first very funny 30 minutes shows its hand and then, unfortunately, continues to wave that hand frantically for the next hour.:::0:::None
...this is the type of film where the deceased spills out of his coffin, people are splattered with feces and if one person can accidentally take a hallucinogen, three are funnier.:::0:::C
A well-crafted British farce -- albeit one with an American director, Frank Oz, working the controls - this throwback to the haughty high jinks of vintage Ealing comedies begins with an obvious, but effective, gag.:::1:::3/4
No, there aren't a lot of surprise giggles in it. But at this Funeral, the pleasure is in seeing those giggles coming.:::1:::3/5
Dinklage makes the most of a thankless role. The remaining actors are all OK, all immediately forgettable -- like the movie itself.:::0:::2.5/4
This broad farce blows the coffin lid off dignified send-offs, thanks to Dean Craig's screwball script and the deft direction by Frank Oz.:::1:::B
Director Frank Oz has pulled off this kind of material before, most notably in Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. But Death at a Funeral is too crude, and a bit too mean -- in particular, the blackmailing subplot featuring Peter Dinklage.:::0:::2/4
Although set in England with a predominantly British cast, Death at a Funeral is no stiff-upper-lipped comedy, but a lean, mean, and often crude, farce.:::1:::B
Death at a Funeral is a passable example of the British species of comedy. Directed by Frank Oz, it has the requisite amount of knockabout silliness.:::1:::B
An old-fashioned English farce with enough gross-out humor to rival the dumb and dumberest of American movies, but also enough smarts to make your pleasure guilt-free.:::1:::4/5
Full of tired, sitcom-level gags.:::0:::1.5/5
In a successful comedy of manners, the screenwriter and director are supposed to build the carefully lain plot to a frenzied fever pitch. Between Craig's lackluster script and Oz's tepid direction, its gait never gets beyond that of an elderly mallwalker.:::0:::2/4

Like Altman's Gosford Park, Oz's film is an organism comprising intersecting oddballs...:::1:::3/4
..spins and whirls and sputters and wheezes, but never at exactly the right moments.:::0:::1.5/4
Screenwriter Dean Craig and director Frank Oz are not at all shy about possibly offending midgets, the elderly or the dead. From a hilariously insipid rambling eulogy to a naked man on the roof, this funeral turns into a demented upper-class riot.:::1:::3.5/5
Oz does a decent job of building up to Death's big laughs.:::1:::3/6
Dying is easy, comedy is hard, as the saying goes. A comedy about dying, especially a British farce, requires a specifically light, deft touch, which director Frank Oz achieves only about half the time in Death at a Funeral.:::0:::None
Working with a broad script by Dean Craig, director Frank Oz goes for American-style physicality, marching his players around a country house in which a toilet, alas, plays a big part.:::0:::C+
Oz keeps all these balls in the air pretty deftly, and the cast tears into it. What gums things up is Craig's script.:::0:::2.5/4
Death at a Funeral never even approaches the best of Oz's oeuvre.:::0:::None
Death at a Funeral is flawed, but I'm willing to forgive a lot of flaws when a movie makes me laugh as much as this one.:::1:::3/4
Death at a Funeral is a dark British farce whose conventionality should not be held against it -- old-fashioned farces are murder to bring off.:::1:::None
An attempt at dark comedy that comes off more dark than comic...strained and effortful rather than blithely lighthearted.:::0:::C
This is a comedy that favors mania over wit and requires a high tolerance for sh*&$. It didn't evoke more than the occasional smile from this viewer.:::0:::C
Silly, screwball comedy - for those who enjoy droll British humor.:::1:::7/10

A strained farce in which lots of one-dimensional Brits converge at the memorial service for their family's patriarch and proceed to act like buffoons.:::0:::1.5/4
In the end, the all-out pandemonium wins us over, but only just.:::1:::3/5
Puts the fun in funeral.:::1:::None
The tension in Death at a Funeral is between good manners and good comedy, something [director] Oz exploits throughout. Humor has a decided British accent, given that it's all about making genteel people cringe.:::1:::None
This topsy-turvy funeral produces a number of smiles, giggles, pleasant guffaws and several solid, sustained laughs. Not a bad batting average as comedies go.:::1:::None
Director Frank Oz nearly redeems himself after his disastrous "Stepford Wives" remake, with a British black comedy that goes over the top backwards.:::1:::B+
Everything that can go wrong does go wrong in the funeral that serves as the center of this serviceable, well-acted British comedy, which offers some clever hijinks and some amusing moments if not really big laughs.:::1:::B-
A brilliant bunch of character actors completely let loose on the material.:::1:::4/5
A crisp and clever hour and a half that, like the best screwball comedies, barely pauses for laughs.:::1:::None
Funerals can be fun is the point made by this British comedy, a Feydeau-like farce brimming with brio, one that travels beautifully across the Atlantic.:::1:::B+
Winds up as a fairly inspirational comedy, without being truly memorable.:::1:::3/5

Terrible, terrible.:::0:::None
Allen's forced approach to Judd Pillot and John Peaslee's Screenwriting 101-style script has merely left everyone floating on their own.:::0:::1/5
This vanity project has the feel of an extended sitcom pilot.:::0:::D-
Allen screws up his directing debut with a script that smothers his wit in a blanket of bland.:::0:::0/4
Tim Allen's directorial debut, a strained comedy drama about an ex-con trying to go straight, isn't nearly crazy enough.:::0:::None
We get charmless hack work from two sitcom writers, a phoned-in ensemble, and for Allen a vanity role that could certainly be called criminal.:::0:::None
Each actor appears to have received the script to a different movie, while Allen adds his own directorial touch of sexual vulgarity.:::0:::D-
You'd think that getting Allen, Sigourney Weaver, J.K. Simmons, Kelsey Grammer, Jeanne Tripplehorn and Ray Liotta together for a comedy would be at the least intriguing, but as it turns out, not so much.:::0:::2.5/5

This third "Twilight" film eclipses its predecessors but its anti-climactic story and its melodramatic tendencies still hold it back.":::0:::2.5/5
Edward is cold and controlling: the archetype of an abusive partner and Jacob just acts like a rapist in training, he keeps trying to kiss Bella against her will.:::0:::1/5
[For] "Eclipse," it was easy to go through the list of old complaints and check them off one by one as the film progressed, including a story that leads absolutely nowhere.:::0:::2/4
Like Bella, non-fans have a choice, and making a choice to stay away may save one some bewilderment.:::0:::2/4
This may be Slade's film but it's Summit's franchise, so any individuality he might wish to imbue in Eclipse comes a distant second to the needs of the series at large.:::0:::None
It is not exactly praise to call 'Eclipse' the best film in 'The Twilight Saga' to date.:::0:::C
Meyer's teen bore-triangle has a mimetic quality, assuming the same degree of naval gazing self-interest as the target demographic.:::0:::None
Eclipse's adolescent roots continue to shine through but for once they're made to work in the film's favor rather than against it. It's competent and only rarely silly and considering the hole the series has been in that's quite a feat.:::1:::7/10
Perhaps the most watchable entry in the Twilight series so far, it's still saddled with the most cipher-like heroine of all time.:::0:::5/10
Certainly not awful, but the producer's dedication to Stephenie Meyer's drawn-out story creates a lumbering third movie that borderlines on downright dull.:::0:::6/10
It's interesting to see each film make Bella into an even bigger creep than previously imagined, with Eclipse turning the indecisive heroine into a mean-spirited provocateur unworthy of all the attention lavished on her.:::0:::D
... at least director David Slade pulls the film from the doldrums of the second film and sends the fur flying across the lush Pacific Northwest backdrops in the climax.:::0:::None
'Well, I am hotter than you.' This supposed reference to body temperature, uttered by werehunk Jacob to sparkly vampire Edward, is not just the funniest line in the film but a nice distillation of the tension that now drives the series.:::0:::2/4
Eclipse surprises with (much needed) improvement; the first real blockbuster of the franchise.:::1:::3.5/5
If the producers of Twilight were given permission to remake Casper ... they'd probably have his ghostly apparition dress in some three-quarter jean-shorts, just to keep his modesty intact. Somebody has to think of the children, right:::0:::1.5/5

What began as an enjoyably perverse fable of teen romance and chastity has dwindled, by this third instalment, into a sorry, soppy saga.:::0:::1/5
More action, more characters, a tad more humor and some interesting backstories help but do nothing to improve upon the series' fatal flaws.:::0:::C+
Eclipse reinvigorates the Twilight saga, giving the fans what they want as well as being good enough to keep casual viewers interested.:::1:::3/5
Manages to transcend the soapiness of its predecessors and work quite well as an engaging story about sacrifice, romance and, interestingly, the inner conflicts of the undead.:::1:::B-
Continues the mopey saga of sparkly vampires, shirtless werewolves and a heroine so cloyingly vapid she makes Carrie Bradshaw seem generous and self-aware.:::0:::None
Was two hours' worth of such repetitive and overheated emotional triangulation really necessary--even for the demographic that'll be breathing hard over every frame?:::1:::3/5
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, the third outing in the supernatural saga of high romance and higher camp, finally shows its fangs with a dazzling display of imagery to go along with a hurried sense of danger.:::1:::3/5
The film is a swirl of raging hormones, bitter jealousies and the aching grip of feelings that have yet to be physically consummated.:::1:::4/5
As a phenomenon, Twilight still takes some beating, but in the end Eclipse, while certainly servicing the fans, should perhaps have given them more than a stop-gap until next-year's two-part finale.:::0:::2/5
There's a new director this time (David Slade), to little avail.:::0:::2/5

Eclipse is an unfortunate entry in a franchise that, while certainly flawed, had at least built up some dramatic momentum over the course of its first two installments.:::0:::28/100
Slightly better...but still sucky.:::0:::1.35/5
The good news is that the mood is a little lighter than in New Moon, which was full of teenage angst and suicide attempts. Edward and Bella even get to smile now and again and there's the occasional funny line.:::1:::3/5
It's a definite step up from New Moon and might even leave the harshest critics just a teeny bit excited about what's in store come the two-part Breaking Dawn... The countdown to November 2011 begins...:::1:::3/5
More pouting, mumbling and gazing into the distance, mainly. But hey. NOBODY does it better than these guys.:::1:::4/5
All three actors are comfortable with their characters, and Slade finds the right balance of action and romance; the story feels organic. Some of the dialogue is earnest and silly, but the core strength of the Stephenie Meyer novels is here: the battle be:::1:::B+
"All I want is your protection," he says to Bella, firmly removing her hand from inside his shirt. "I'll protect you no matter what." Edward Cullen: the human condom.:::0:::1/5
Not as good as Twilight, not as bad as New Moon, Eclipse is decent teen cinema that will thrill fans and mollify their accompaniers. Can't wait for the caesarean-by- teeth in the next one...:::1:::3/5
The franchise has finally produced a movie that all will be able to enjoy -- even hard-done-by boyfriends who've been dragged kicking and screaming to see it.:::1:::3/5
It's a nice mix of comedy and action, especially with the running gag of Jacob appearing shirtless early and often so Jacob fanatics can howl about his hot abs.:::1:::3/4
Certainly the Twilight film in which the most violence happens, which gives it the illusion of having the most incident.:::0:::3/10
The supernatural reduced to an uninteresting teen love triangle about a girl essentially making a choice between necrophilia and bestiality.:::0:::2/5
Eclipse isn't afraid to poke fun at itself and there's a fair amount of self-referential humour in the film, something that was painfully absent from Twilight and New Moon.:::1:::3/5
It's efficiently made, with a few moments of energy and levity, but everyone really needs to lighten up.:::0:::2.5/5
The biggest problem remains the characters: neither Slade nor Stewart are capable of turning manipulative whinger Bella into anything more than a joyless black hole sucking the life from every scene.:::0:::2/5
By far the best Twilight film to date, Slade should satisfy the fan base while opening up the series to more sceptical viewers...:::1:::4/5
The third in the Twilight series of films may be the best so far, but I still wonder if this series will ever amount to anything besides box office gold.:::0:::C

'Eclipse' is the best 'Twilight' has to offer. While I never see greatness coming from these films, this one is pretty good.:::1:::6/10
A little levity, self-awareness, and long-overdue back stories make the latest Twilight installment not only watchable but (dare I say it?) actually enjoyable.:::1:::3.0/4.0
David Slade infuses this third entry with the kind of visceral set-pieces, knowing humour and more measured melodrama that the saga has been sorely lacking.:::1:::3/5
...one of the most satisfying big-budget extravaganzas to come around in quite some time.:::1:::3.5/4
A compelling enough sequel certain to enthrall the target demographic apt to agree that it's a big improvement over Twilight 2, though not nearly as enchanting as the original.:::1:::3/4
Saved from erratic pacing and mawkishness by backhanded wit and a can-do supporting cast, will Eclipse win over the non-Twihard like New Moon could have? No, but it's a nice place holder until the last film comes along.:::1:::3/5
Still bad, but just maybe, mildly less bad than the previous two.:::0:::2/4
...core fans will go see this movie regardless of what critics, or any other rational human beings, tend to think of this color-graded, celluloid turkey.:::0:::D-
For the non-fan moviegoer, a true blood transfusion may have helped this slightly anemic soap opera.:::1:::5/10
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse isn't the best of three, but neither is it the worst. ... Obviously, we're not talking about quality to match the Toy Story trilogy, but neither are we plumbing the Police Academy or Friday the 13th depths.:::0:::2.5/4
Eclipse is ... over-stuffed with characters and story lines and like the proverbial hoarder the series keeps adding new stuff without letting anything go.:::0:::3/10
Overly dramatic but balanced with humor and action, it is a perfect fir for its devoted fans.:::1:::6/10
[T]hose who argue that it's 'better than the first two' are simply admitting how awful those movies were.:::0:::2/5
124 minutes of listening to teenagers melodramatically espouse the depth of their convoluted passions for each other makes for a pretty dire trip to the movies.:::0:::2/5
When it comes to the things this brand is famous for -- angsty canoodling, ethereal rocking out, truckloads of male beauty, Duran Duran-style make-up and culturally savvy jokes -- Eclipse actually goes one better than the last offering.:::1:::3/5
I enjoyed Eclipse about as much as someone outside the target audience can, but that still isn't enough to merit an outright recommendation.:::0:::2.5/4
It's easy to knock the Twilightfilms, with their taste for cheesy special effects and teenage hyper-ventilation, but the feelings that course through them are honest enough -- just your average old-fashioned romantic-masochistic teen-dream rapture.:::1:::3/5
Better than the first two instalments, but not likely to endear itself to detractors, Eclipse is all about the trashy topless wolves, dreamy abstinent vampires and doomy teenaged longing, with Hard Candy director David Slade making the most of a marginall:::1:::3.5/5
Fans will be pleased with what Slade and co have come up with, everyone else will continue to wonder what all the fuss is about.:::1:::None
May I suggest that the only way to enjoy the Twilight films is with the Rifftrax.:::0:::None
More than ever %u2014 and all for the love of sullen high school senior Bella Swan %u2014 it's teen wolf vs. teen vampire.:::0:::2.5/4
"Eclipse" isn't awful but, like its two predecessors, it is a largely listless, apathetic affair.:::0:::C
There's a narrative of sorts, but it stands squarely behind the flat conversing and posturing of the washboard abs-blessed Jacob, moody Edward and humorless Bella.:::0:::2/4
Poorly-acted, bland, overlong and thrill-less. It insults your intelligence from start to finish.:::0:::1.21/10
The third in the teenage-girl-vampire-werewolf love trilogy series is full of story parallels that make the central decision by Bella a very strong core for the film, despite some more corny dialogue.:::1:::2.5/4
For the Twihard fans, Eclipse should thrill and excite to no end; for the rest of the world, it stands as the best of the three in the saga.:::1:::3/4
Not as deathly dull as Twilight or as screamingly dull as New Moon, Eclipse is merely dull.:::0:::2/4
In a universe where almost all CGI-laden, blood-spilling tentpole movies are aimed at ensnaring the teenage male, there's something to be said for a series of films aimed squarely -- and successfully -- at teenage girls.:::1:::3/5
I can't pretend that the third episode instilled a fever in my blood, but it didn't leave me cold. For the first time in the series I felt I'd seen a real movie.:::1:::None
it's still the equivalent of emotional pornography for teenagers. But there is a neat vampire society story that creeps in there, and I liked that part.:::1:::3.5/5

[T]he makers of the latest Twilight flick rest serene and calm - confident that their audience will take what it wants from the film, whether or not there is anything much up on the screen.:::0:::None
Eclipse breaks the mold at the hands of a craftsman. It becomes something new, something oddly watchable, at times enjoyable and surprisingly unlike what has come before.:::1:::C+
This film will not disappoint Twihards and will have everyone bummed that Breaking Dawn is a year and half away.:::1:::4/5
Eclipse almost fully redeems this franchise. It finally brings some bite to these vampy cats and wolf cubs. It actually looks and sounds like a real movie and not some student film with a blind cinematographer. I still HATE Bella and Edward.:::1:::B+
It's not as good as the first film but it's better than the second film. Make of that as you will.:::1:::B
Tighter, scarier; this is the best of the Twilight films. Which is a lot like saying that getting punched is better than being stabbed.:::0:::2.5/5
Slade has done an excellent job tapping into what Twilight fans want, regardless of how shamelessly their buttons are pushed.:::1:::3/5
It's that lack of chemistry and conviction and anything that might resemble charisma which makes you truly notice the fact that this film is 130 brutal, unnecessary minutes long.:::0:::None
This franchise wasn't made for critics. Team Edward or Team Jacob? If you don't have an answer to that question, then who really cares what you think anyway?:::1:::None

The supernatural stuff is just so much filigree on the story of a girl, her boyfriend and the guy who can't take no for an answer.:::0:::None
Nao e possivel que, no fim das contas, toda a serie realmente gire em torno do romance entediante de um "vampiro" machista e sua ninfeta suicida.:::0:::2/5
Appetite here is more for skin than blood, with Cullen and Black stifling their competing libidos for the time being. While trophy teen Bella and her whining codependency issues, trifles with rival vampire and werewolf boy toy objects of postponed desire.:::0:::None
But to say that "Eclipse" is the best of the three "Twilight" films is like saying frogs were the best of the plagues God visited upon Egypt in the Old Testament.:::0:::D
Fans will certainly not be disappointed.:::1:::2.4/5
By keeping it simple and staging chaste romantic tensions against scenic backdrops, Eclipse probably gives the fans what they want. I think they deserve a little more.:::1:::3/5
I like seeing Edward frustrated by Bella's individuality. He can't control her and make her do what he wants. This 'perfect' love is actually totally incompatible.:::1:::None
The core problems with the Twilight films are still very much present in this new instalment including the plodding pace, the trite dialogue and the very regressive subtext.:::0:::2/5
I left the cinema feeling as though I deserved a t-shirt that read 'I survived the Eclipse':::0:::2/5
At one point, the werewolf Jacob notes that Robert Pattinson's Edward isn't even alive. It's easy to mistake the line for a commentary on Pattinson's lifeless acting.:::0:::3/5
Director David Slade ably takes over...demonstrating his own take on the key elements of the story, adolescent longing and primal physical confrontations.:::1:::B
A drama about complex matters of the heart and chivalry with Edward the vampire exemplifying a knight's bravery, courtesy, honor, and skill at arms.:::1:::4/5
In a rare moment of insight, the teenage but immortal vampires in The Twilight Saga: Eclipse complain about being "frozen" in their lives, unable to "move forward." So is everyone involved in this deathtrap of a franchise.:::0:::None
As long as these movies remain about three petulant whiners staring at each other to little effect, no rousing action sequences are going to save them from their torpor.:::0:::2.5/5
Hold on tight, spider monkey. With its third installment, the Twilight series has reached dangerously close to competence.:::0:::2.5/5
Step aside, you creepy cougars: Finally, there's a Twilight suitable even for normal grown-ups.:::1:::None
By punctuating Bella's hand-wringing histrionics with moments of comic relief, Slade strikes a pleasing balance that future 'Twilight' directors might well find instructive.:::1:::3/4
Saying that the third film in a series with two pretty weak prior entries is the best of the bunch may be faint praise, but that happens to be the case with Eclipse.:::1:::3/5
As always, the biggest screams emanating from the audience come when Lautner bares his chest.:::0:::C
The supposedly epic battle the entire film builds toward -- the single action set-piece -- is a ho-hummer. Fire and ice, turns out, was an oversell: Think tepid tap water instead.:::0:::2.5/5
Increasingly picturesque photography, amped-up action, borrowed poetry, and age-old romance have The Twilight Saga on its surest footing yet--that is, until the youngsters grow up and realize True Blood tells the same story so much better.:::1:::2.5/4
The choice of whether to see Eclipse isn't really a question of whether the movie is good or bad. It's a question of whether or not the movie speaks to your secret, unregulated, inherently ridiculous experience of identification and desire.:::1:::None
A brutal watch until the supernatural battle scene.:::0:::C
The intensity is sustained and passionate. It's the glue that holds the glop together.:::1:::3/5
David Slade goes for more of everything: action, violence and unrequited sexual tension.:::1:::3/5
You get the sense that Jacob and Edward would have preferred enacting their fave moments from "Brokeback Mountain" if only Bella had been shacked up elsewhere. But she isn't, Blanche!:::1:::None
There's no middle ground with the Twilight saga: You either surrender to Stephenie Meyer's swoony tale of forbidden love, squeaky-clean teen style, or you just don't get it.:::0:::None
No sex before marriage makes vampirism totally unsexy in this riskless, casualty-free confrontation:::0:::C
Director David Slade keeps the action brisk and the time-killing attractive ... All of which should be like a freshly opened vein for fans.:::1:::6/10
While the new Eclipse remains foremost a flick for devotees, it has sturdier pleasures and takes on its emotional ambitions with renewed dedication.:::1:::3/4
Now that we've hit the third picture in the franchise, it's clear the studio behind it, Summit, actually prefers that the movies be programmed and predictable.:::0:::5/10
Kristin Stewart, an actress who shows amazing range and ability when not playing Bella, continues to do her best imitation of a cardboard cutout here.:::0:::2.5/4
The third chapter in Bella Swan's via dolorosa is still pretty much of a drag for anyone not affiliated with Teams Edward and Jacob, but it certainly eclipses the dead-on-arrival dud that was New Moon.:::1:::3/5
Though there are fewer dead-air gaps between words (gaps that in New Moon you could drive a truck through and still have time to file a nail), it still cries out for a transfusion.:::0:::4/10
This is definitely the worst installment of the franchise to date.:::0:::None
Eclipse is the least laughable installment yet in the series, and director David Slade efficiently delivers the fan service that Twihards require.:::1:::None
Eclipse is still bogged down by the poor plotting, slow pacing and sub-par acting that has, sadly, marred the film series all along.:::0:::2/5
Calling Eclipse the best of the three Twilight films so far is certainly fair, but it edges into 'world's tallest midget' territory.:::0:::C-
Eclipse -- the third in the Twilight series -- is more than just corny. Eclipse is boring. It's exceedingly boring.:::0:::2/4
The Twilight saga depends on Bella not deciding, not resolving, and above all, not moving on.:::0:::5/10
The most troublesome blow is the archaic message of a girl who will abandon everything for a boy - friends, mother, father and even her soul. This is a character whose only identity is her boyfriend; Bella Swan sets women in film back fifty years.:::0:::C-
Despite its horror movie premise, the Twilight series has become an ADHD sedative.:::0:::None
The first two movies were mediocre, but "Eclipse" represents one of the more astonishing upgrades in movie franchise history.:::1:::4/5
Although Eclipse isn't a great film on its own, it's pretty much the Twilight movie fans have been waiting for.:::1:::3/4
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse is like two lovers looking in each other's eyes and murmuring things meaningful to only them. Anyone not in the embrace is unlikely to understand, or care, what is being said.:::0:::1.5/4
It appears to have embraced its own sense of camp and is consistently funny in an intentional way. For the first time, I found myself curious to see what comes next.:::1:::None
While it may seem like arguing gradients of garbage, The Twilight Saga: Eclipse is closest movie so far to finding whatever potential lies inside Stephenie Meyer's otherwise trite terror romance.:::1:::3/5
If New Moon had no story to speak of, Eclipse almost has too much. It's a much better problem to have.:::1:::None
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse dispenses with much of the caramel gooeyness of the first two episodes in favor of decent action, some heartfelt tender moments and even a splash of wit. This time they're actually Twi-ing.:::1:::3/4
Twilight Saga: Eclipse is by far the best of the bestselling Stephenie Meyer novels-turned-movie. Keep in mind, West Nile Virus is similarly the "best" mosquito-borne illness and Portland, Oregon is the "best" city to be homeless.:::0:::1.5/4
It is not the technology, stunning locations or editing techniques that we remember, it is the tantalising relationships and the romantic notion of following tradition, promising eternal love and protecting the soul that affects us where it matters most:::1:::None
"Eclipse" is a vast improvement over the first two movies. The pacing is quicker, and more movement is evident.:::1:::2.5/4
The movie is about a girl's primal dream of being desired. That may well be corny, but it's also an essential antidote to summer-movie hardware.:::1:::B+
Having imposed something like narrative clarity on the story, new director David Slade is still stuck with the story.:::0:::2/5
With more action and humor than either of its predecessors, 'Eclipse' is the best 'Twilight' flick thus far. But that doesn't mean it's good.:::0:::2/5
Poor acting, lousy special effects and theatrics better suited for an Afterschool Special. Yup, Twilight is back.:::0:::2/4
Everybody wakes up from a brooding-induced slumber to liven it up! I think Edward even smiled!:::1:::2.5/4
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse is superior to its two predecessors in every possible way. The mythology finally feels comfortable in its own skin, aware of both its strengths and limitations, and appears to be striding confidently into the future.:::1:::6/10
Darker, grittier, and a tad more thought-provoking than the previous installments, Eclipse is certainly tops among the first three even as, storywise, the characters are more or less in the same place by the end that they were in the beginning.:::1:::2.5/4
Much like the "Harry Potter" series, the gap widens considerably between the readers and non-readers with a noticeable effect on the enjoyment factor and entertainment value. The faithful fans familiar with the characters have a...:::1:::3/4
Since "Eclipse" is showing in IMAX, it'll be kibble for fans wanting to experience the sensation of climbing up Lautner's nose or burrowing deeply into Pattinson's pores.:::1:::None
An endless conversation about an immature, moody, generally unlikable, teenage girl's feelings. Please Bella, grow up.:::0:::3/5
Unlike the barely living dioramas that were the dreadful "Twilight" and the virtually unspeakable "New Moon," it is slightly more lively and energetic and isn't nearly as much of a chore to sit through.:::0:::2/5
If you want to see a truly gripping movie about young love and vampires, skip this and rent Let the Right One In instead.:::0:::2.5/5
It's not my cup of Earl Grey, but the fans cheered long and hard at the end of my recent preview. For that, I give it a 5 out of 10. (Parental Review also Available):::1:::None
Viewers who value the little things, such as passable acting and dialogue not stolen from a sixth-grader's diary, will once again walk away dazed, dumbfounded and partially deaf from all the surrounding squealing.:::0:::2/5
There's no excuse for Stephenie Meyer's terrible writing. And now her mind-numbing logorrhea has overwhelmed whatever salvage operation the big screen can offer.:::0:::1/4
The volatile love triangle is amped-up and edgier. Expect a lot more bite!:::1:::7/10
It's still has the angst-filled melodrama that made the others so insufferable, and its attempts to be funny come off as cutesy and forced. Worse still, it's boring for long stretches.:::0:::2/4
If the movies keep improving like this, the people who automatically hate them just because they're popular with teenage girls will be forced to reconsider.:::1:::B
If Slade doesn't necessarily advance the medium with this installment, he nonetheless advances the franchise, with enough lucidity and skill that he's persuaded at least one erstwhile agnostic to take a stand.:::1:::3/4
Slade has encouraged the actors to see the humor in the film's goofy love triangle.:::1:::3/4
Anyone walking into Eclipse without seeing the previous two movies would be genuinely perplexed; behavior that barely makes sense when you know the story becomes truly nutty without context.:::0:::2.5/4
It's stagnant to the degree that screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg pads out the narrative with no fewer than three narrated costume-drama flashbacks.:::0:::C
Slade shapes the tale's characterization and narrative with a sure hand, pausing to fill in the back stories of several vampires. The asides don't feel digressive, but add depth and scope to the story.:::1:::3/4
Less involving -- at least for this non-tween-girl -- is the love triangle that, for all its plaintive yearning after three movies, still never feels like it's scratched the frequently shirtless surface.:::0:::2.5/5
Melissa Rosenberg's screenplay (like her scripts for the first two installments) is faithful enough to Meyer's soap-operatic inclinations, but I kind of wish she weren't. I kind of wish Bella weren't such an indecisive wuss about her feelings.:::0:::2/4
With roughly 20 minutes of its two-hour running time devoted to characters doing something besides alternately moping and declaring their eternal love for each other, Eclipse stands as the most action-packed entry yet.:::0:::C
In director David Slade's hands, the story plays like two movies in one, neither being particularly well made, whether it's the would-be action horror of a brewing vampire-on-werewolf fight or the endlessly talky Bella-Edward torpor.:::0:::C
Finally allows those of us unfamiliar with the books by Stephenie Meyer to understand why the saga of the vampire, the wolf, and the sullen girl in the middle has become an international phenomenon.:::1:::3.0/5
Slade can't completely overcome the mistakes from the first two films, such as the fake-looking werewolf computer graphics or the bland miscasting of Dakota Fanning as the head Volturi.:::0:::2.5/4
Eclipse has a lot to be proud of, including much better performances from Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner, but there still are a few problems with the series.:::1:::B
"Eclipse," with its dual push/pull story lines, spicier love triangle and more plentiful and violent action scenes gives the series a needed jolt.:::1:::B
The good news is that this third installment...is the best yet. The bad is that's not saying much.:::0:::C-
Has its cheesecake and eats it, too. It's heavy on topless shots of barely legal Taylor Lautner, but now Pattinson grumbles, "Doesn't he own a shirt?":::1:::3.5/5
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse is just one more walk on the mild sides for tweens who dream of being penetrated by cold flesh that will keep them young and cute forever.:::0:::2/4

If this were an interesting film, the struggle would be between the pull of religious fundamentalism and (gasp!) miscegenation.:::0:::2/4
Unless the sight of Stewart kissing Pattinson (and, later, Lautner) is enough to send you into convulsions of joy, there aren't any thrills or surprises in this movie.:::0:::2/5
This film should come with a phone cord to twirl around your finger as you engage in eternal dating gossip.:::0:::C-
The new, more assertive Bella Swan is the most welcome addition to the Twilight Saga -- that, and the sly humor Rosenberg's snuck into Eclipse.:::1:::3/5
It is certainly not asking too much of Slade to behead people, and he ups the Twilight action factor significantly in Eclipse. There are welcome outbursts of gratuitous violence, building to a large battle among various vampire and werewolf hordes.:::1:::B-
Predictable fluff.:::0:::2.5/5
About as bad as it gets:::0:::2/10
No question, this is the most successful entry so far, and that's high praise, considering the first two films were comatose in comparison.:::1:::3/4
never gels into something that is as massively important as it thinks it is, and there is nothing as compelling as those veins popping out of Lautner's biceps:::0:::1/5
A more robustly entertaining film than either of its predecessors.:::1:::3/5
Probably the best in the series, and a definite rebound from the bland second one. It will make its intended audience swoon.:::1:::3.5/4
The kiss of the vampire is cooler, the werewolf is hotter, the battles are bigger and the choices are, as everyone with a pulse (and a few without) knows by now, life-changing.:::1:::3.5/5
The first Twilight film that works at all on its own, giving us better characters, tense action sequences, and a wry acknowledgement that, yes, this is maybe all a little bit silly.:::1:::3.5/5
This is what passes for romance in the early 21st century: a sexless, passionless tug-of-war among children...:::0:::None
When you see love represented on film in such an authentic and genuine manner it's easy to find yourself in a forgiving mood.:::1:::C+
Slade skips the stultifying slow-motion fantasy sequences that so weighed down New Moon in favor of a well-paced blend of action and introspection.:::1:::4.5/5
I am just as shocked as you are that there is a fresh tomato next to my review right now. Slade delivers a fun film that is completely self-aware and full of intensity.:::1:::3.5/5
The goatee-sporting, shaven-headed Travolta throws himself around with gusto, and the action is bruising and bloody, but to a viewer on this side of La Manche, the film's casually racist attitude to its non-white characters is shocking.:::0:::None

Lacking any compelling style, attitude or storytelling.:::0:::C-
A fun, over the top action movie that doesn't care that it's stupid and over the top.:::1:::B
Not even the pleasures inherent in watching John Travolta mug it up as a gonzo CIA operative bent on breaking things and killing people... are sufficient recompense for sitting through this by-the-numbers slog from the fevered brain of Luc Besson:::0:::78/100
Morel's underrated eye and knack for making kinetic movement rhythmic and easy to follow elevates Besson's run-of-the-mill, mismatched-buddy thriller into a propulsive, enjoyably Eurotrashy entertainment.:::1:::None
It's both a classic mismatched buddy action movie transplanted to Paris and a French idea of an American action movie abroad.:::1:::None
With a screenwriter formerly of the Israeli Airborne Defense Forces, this is the kind of sour anti-terror travelogue where you're set up to howl on cue when bearded or burka clad Arab insurgents are preemptively shot in the head or blown to smithereens.:::0:::None

Ita(TM)s absolute nonsense, of course, but does quite nicely as knockabout Friday night fun. We can smell a sequel if Travolta can be bothered.:::1:::3/5

If there really is a fine line between stupid and clever, this is so far to one side that it makes it look like a dot. If you take the time to check in your brain when getting your popcorn though, you'll probably be too busy laughing to mind.:::1:::3/5
Undemanding and unoriginal, this is all swagger and no substance.:::0:::2/5
Preposterous, knockabout stuff but prevented from being genuinely enjoyable by a nasty undercurrent of racism.:::0:::2/5
Travolta and Meyers do all that's required of them in another Besson B-movie blow-out. No brain required, but to be fair, twice as entertaining as many films with double the budget.:::1:::3/5
Saddled with a mostly thankless role as the straight man, Rhys Meyers is decidedly wooden, while the energetic Travolta fails to make us forget he's played this sort of freestyle psycho one too many times already.:::0:::2/5
Is this a satire on amoral violence or a celebration of it? Regrettably, it's the latter, which should give you some idea of just how despicable this film is.:::0:::2/5
Another cynically violent, casually racist action movie that even Michael Winner would disown.:::0:::1/5
You'll have forgotten most of what just happened before the credits have finished. But while you're on the ride, it's great fun.:::1:::3/5
The monotony is crowned by a predictable plot twist. Producer Luc Besson, maker of the similar but superior Nikita, conceived the original story. It should, like most of its characters, have been killed on sight.:::0:::1/5
Murder, mayhem and a wildly improbable yarn ensue in this tiresome flick.:::0:::None
Forgettable Friday night entertainment at its most brainless.:::0:::2/5
From the gun-happy guys who brought us Taken, here's another slice of misogynistic, xenophobic mayhem from the City of Light.:::1:::3/5
An uproarious late-night action blast, and it's going to get trashed by virtually every other reviewer on the planet. Ignore them. It's brilliant.:::1:::4/5
Ironically, it's Travolta's voracious, scenery-chewing and wide-eyed ravings which turn out to be the guilty pleasure of From Paris With Love, an otherwise dumb action adventure that clumsily pilfers scenes from the Bourne trilogy.:::0:::None
Luc Besson should be embarrassed to have his name on the poster.:::0:::1/5

Not to be taken seriously. But, ridiculous as the film is, it's loads of fun:::1:::3.5/5
[Director] Besson ignores reality and common sense, creating a ludicrous plot that barely provides an excuse for John Travolta to do very bad things in Paris . . .:::0:::0/4
Armed to the teeth with more action movie cliches than a Steven Seagal show reel. Yep, it has 'guilty pleasure' stamped all over it.:::1:::3.5/5
An abysmal film: a buddy comedy with no jokes, implausible storylines and boring action scenes.:::0:::None
A strong plot and some super cool tough-guy dialogue makes this an entertaining and engaging film:::1:::None
As a pulsating action thriller with edge-of-seat car chases, massive explosions, gun-fire and major stunts, the film works a treat, largely due to the odd-couple pairing of Travolta and Meyers:::1:::None

Blame scenarist/producer Luc Besson, whose women are either whores or terrorists. Besson may be from Paris, but his idea of love is laced with bile.:::0:::1/4
What makes this concoction succeed as passable entertainment is that it doesn't pretend to be intellectually capable of more than scratching its name in the dirt with a stick.:::1:::3.5/5

From Paris With Love is even more mindless than Taken and is more fun than the recent Edge of Darkness. But that still leaves it lagging far behind Morel's District B13.:::0:::None

Although John Travolta and Jonathan Rhys Meyers make an unlikely duo, they perform their roles with gusto. And the fast-paced action here is exciting to watch.:::1:::None

From Paris with Love is like The Odd Couple with automatic weapons. This enjoyable, low rent Bourne actioneer may be preposterous, but that's half its cheeky charm.:::1:::6/10

A marginally offensive film which attempts to tackle deeply serious world issues by having a bearded biker shoot them with a rocket launcher.:::0:::2/5
Instead of including the audience in on the joke, it offers second-rate goods and then tries to slip them by us.:::0:::1/4
sticks to convention:::0:::2.5/5
Stoopid fun, From Paris With Love doesn't do much for Paris or love, or your brain cells, but it flies like a crazed eagle on uppers and comes from the talented, propulsive schlocketeer Pierre Morel.:::1:::3/4
Rude male-bonding, eye-catching action, fast editing and loud music drive the plot; logic takes a back seat (or, sometimes, just gets shoved in the trunk).:::1:::2.5/4
[A] breathlessly exciting, surprisingly funny, nonstop 90 minutes of audacious twists, excessive violence, sexy car chases, and just plain cinematic tomfoolery...:::1:::None
No movie star appears to have more fun in a crap movie than John Travolta, and his inimitable my-check-has-cleared! glee is the best thing about this lame espionage thriller.:::0:::None
The movie has the patchwork plotting of grade-schoolers making up a game at recess: "The hero's a wanna-be spy! He has to hang with a brash superagent! And they hunt a drug stash that's connected to terrorists!":::0:::1/5
The preposterously silly and bullet-riddled From Paris With Love is so leaden and obnoxious that it actually makes you long for the John Travolta of Old Dogs.:::0:::None
John Travolta, channeling Bruce Willis, goes way over the top as a gun-happy, hard-edged, shaved-head dude.:::1:::B-
What a dopey excuse for an action thriller.:::0:::1.5/5
Morel and his crew certainly know how to stage action: the fight scenes and shootouts, the stairwell pursuits and motorway mayhem, are as good, if not better, than anything to come out of Hong Kong in a long time.:::1:::3/4
It appears that the makers of From Paris With Love were hoping to land Bruce Willis as their star but had to settle for John Travolta instead.:::0:::1.5/4
This is the sort of asinine action exercise that needs a star to blow up cars and leap from rooftop to rooftop with gusto. So right about the time that Travolta curses out the Charles De Gaulle customs staff, we know this movie has found a reason to be.:::0:::2/4
From Paris with Love is a raucous cartoon. You have to decide whether or not you want to take this wild ride. It's dippy, dopey, and dizzying.:::1:::2.0/5
Rookie spy joins with veteran killer to stop a terrorist plot in Paris. A slumming John Travolta is the biggest draw in an otherwise lackluster thriller.:::0:::None
As junky and disposable as most Besson productions, From Paris With Love is insomniac viewing, coming soon to a 2 a.m. pay-cable slot near you.:::0:::C+
A bonkers Travolta is always good for a laugh or two, but the picture doesn't come through on its promise of a cartwheeling good time. It's a shame, since Morel and Besson are capable of such wonderful madness.:::0:::C
Tony Manero, Vincent Vega, Charlie Wax. Travolta has his franchise now! Gleeful killer Wax makes Bond and Bourne look like clumsy amateurs. Roaring fun.:::1:::None
I prefer Travolta when he's under the top, not over it, but there is no modulating either him or Morel in this nutty movie.:::1:::B-
A buddy-spy thriller that exudes Euro-trashiness from first frame to last.:::0:::C-
Pauline Kael has already reviewed this movie in her book Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, and it only took her the title.:::0:::2/4
John Travolta kicks that pesky schizophrenic script out of his way to serve up yet another, perfectly entertaining badass.:::1:::None
This is Travolta's most enjoyable and energetic performance since Pulp Fiction and Primary Colors, and he's a blast to watch.:::1:::2.5/4
From Paris With Love is a ''fun trash'' movie that's more trash than fun.:::0:::C
Morel unwisely switches to a more-serious tone midway through the movie, in a misguided attempt to make it appear to be weightier than it is.:::0:::2.5/5
There's no escaping the grinding gears of an American buddy picture that loses something in the translation.:::0:::2/4
Giddily succinct in ways literal-minded folk will not appreciate, From Paris With Love is an object lesson in the realities of what the Obama administration once euphemized as "man-made disaster.":::1:::None
John Travolta breaks the braggadocio meter in the latest tightly wound actioner from Taken's Pierre Morel.:::1:::3/5
We all know how rotten today's movies can be, but even at the bottom of the slag pit, you won't find a load of garbage any smellier than From Paris With Love.:::0:::None
[Morel] brings in lobotomized entertainment at 90-odd minutes. During the February doldrums, this cannot be underestimated.:::1:::None
What might have been a fairly standard buddy comedy is elevated by a hilariously irreverent performance by Travolta and Morel's knack for creating exciting action pieces.:::1:::7/10
The action barely pauses %u2013 and when it does, the talk is hardly memorable. But talk is cheap; fireballs coming out of exploding SUVs are not.:::0:::None
The biggest thing standing in the way of From Paris with Love achieving even that standard is the laughable casting.:::0:::None
Mildly diverting but entirely forgettable.:::0:::2/5
Only a Wild West town between sheriffs has fewer law officers than this film's depiction of Paris.:::0:::None
Nowhere near as fun as that premise probably sounds.:::0:::None
Travolta has/is a blast in an action-thriller-comedy that otherwise comes up short on all three counts.:::0:::None
As with Spaghetti Westerns and sit-coms, you know they've jumped the shark when the tone turns to self-mockery.:::0:::D
It's more cheese than royale.:::0:::2/4
isms and a keener eye; his fastest, most kinetic shots flow together like frames in a flipbook.:::1:::None
You've never seen Travolta like this. Do not consider that to be a compliment.:::0:::C
I'm not sure the movie will end up earning back its stars' huge salaries, but you definitely can't argue they didn't earn them.:::1:::B-
It's not enough to merely swoon over Witherspoon. The movie's entirely too long and leaden to get by on that alone.:::0:::2/4
"How Do You Know" is a complete misfire from famed writer/director James L. Brooks.:::0:::1.5/4
What happened to James L. Brooks?:::0:::1/4
Some of the bits are funny, every now and then they're sweet, the performances are OK and really, with this much talent involved, it's hard not to be disappointed in that.:::1:::3/5
It's all a bit of a slog and, in the end, you don't know much more than you did at the start.:::0:::2/5
What makes any of these kinds of movies run involves the appeal of the main actors, and all three, stalwart in their screen likabilities, smooth the proceedings.:::1:::6/10
Not enough films let their characters talk enough. Because if they did it would usually stop the idiotic plot in its tracks. Points for meandering down the road less traveled.:::1:::3/5
Good news: you've got great actors with wonderful chemistry and comic timing. Bad News: they're playing some of the most irritating, unlikable, infuriating characters ever committed to film:::0:::1.5/5
Even Nicholson's usually scene-stealing bluster can't get this disappointing addition to the Brooks filmography going.:::0:::None
Every scene is as achingly long and laboured as the film's instantly forgettable title.:::0:::1/5
More creative energy has gone into furnishing these characters' apartments than devising credible emotional situations to put them in; the result is wholly undemanding, and best saved for a long-haul flight.:::0:::2/5
James L. Brooks has clearly spent far too long in Los Angeles.:::0:::2/5
Though neither mindless nor insensitive, this interminable movie falls far short of Brooks's best work, which is to say Broadcast News and As Good As It Gets.:::0:::None
Seemingly well-intentioned and inoffensive - but there are so many other films that do this sort of thing faster, better and with more jokes, including a couple from writer-director James L Brook's own back catalogue.:::0:::2/5
Though the film was a box-office dud in the US, Brooks delivers an amusing and consistenly engaging relationship piece that is a cut above the standard romantic comedy.:::1:::3/5
Despite the best efforts of all involved, trying to prise laughs out of How Do You Know is like trying to make concrete float.:::0:::None
Instead of juicing it up with jokes, Brooks has inadvertently given us another story of the American condition, which is that of absolute and incorrigible self-centredness.:::0:::1/5
How Do You Know is a slight and predictable tale of modern day love, padded with subplots about father-son bonding and undeclared love.:::0:::None
For the most part, this story of trying to find out how you know you are in love is so slow and laborious you'll wish they'd just flip a coin and be done with it.:::0:::2/5
How do you know you've got a dud? When a cast this talented and determined can't lift a soporific screenplay to entertaining heights.:::0:::2/5
Acclaimed writer-director James L. Brooks has turned out one of the most unbearable romcoms ever in How Do You Know.:::0:::None
Running a dire 40 minutes longer than it needed to be and favouring static two-shots for long-winded passages of mirthless yakking, the film's momentum is utterly becalmed at regular intervals.:::0:::None
A fatuous and depressing parade of nothingness...:::0:::1/5
Starts badly and just gets worse.:::0:::1/5
Wilson, with his immaculately off-kilter comic timing, is still a pleasure to watch. But Rudd can't rescue his character from the insipidity to which Brooks's screenplay condemns him.:::0:::1/5
Brooks is back with another warm, smart romance along the lines of As Good As It Gets. The snappy characters are well-played by a strong cast, which makes it steadily entertaining even if it's not hugely believable.:::1:::3/5
Nicholson is on autopilot, and Brooks doesn't give the characters the full three dimensions to complement the script's undeniably witty lines.:::0:::2/5
A rom-com with too much rom (winsome) and far too little com.:::0:::1/5
Extremely dull, badly written comedy-drama that never gets off the ground, despite likeable performances from Rudd, Witherspoon and a perfectly cast Wilson.:::0:::2/5
Not Brooks' best, but it has its moments.:::0:::2/5
Contrived, mawkish and mirthless, this feels like it was made by people who haven't had any meaningful human contact for years.:::0:::1/5
Overlong but occasionally appealing rom com in which it is the intangibles of the relationships that prove to be everything:::0:::None
The whole mob yap away in self-absorbed therapy-speak for almost the entire two-hour running time, meaning anyone who lives outside the Beverly Hills nut-bubble - ie almost everyone - is going to be instinctively reaching for the fast-forward button.:::0:::2/5
This neurotic comedy tiptoes from one boring setback to the next, bottling its issues in schmaltz, and thus, costing the film its heart.:::0:::D+
I'll take the movie's distinctive warts over the pasteurized engineering of current comedies any day of the week:::1:::None
Unconventional rom-com that is really neither but gets by on the charisma of the cast including Whiterspoon and especially Rudd who can do no wrong.:::1:::B
Everything looks primed for civilized amusement, but somewhere along the way the laughs dropped off, together with the question mark in the title.:::0:::None
At least half the film plays out at an acceptable level of amusement until its excessively repeated indecisions makes you hanker for the fast forward. This happens well before you reach the two hour mark.:::1:::2.5/5
One factor, and one factor alone, brings 'How Do You Know?' to above average.:::0:::2.5/4
I had more emotional investment in Yogi Bear. That's sad. And Yogi Bear wasted 36 minutes less of my time.:::0:::1/5
Kudos to Brooks for crafting Lisa as the kind of smart, level-headed, capable, red-blooded, confident female protagonist we almost never get to see in the movies.:::1:::3.5/5
"How Do You Know" that this movie is not all that great. Wait till about half way through and then ask for a refund.:::0:::1/5
a warm and fuzzy film that somehow manages to avoid the trap of becoming cloying. It finds piquant and pithy humor and pathos in watching grown-ups who don't quite know what they want:::1:::3/5
The last fifteen minutes is pretty good but that end does not justify the earlier means.:::0:::5/10
Nothing quite clicks in this movie. Nothing really sounds right, or feels right. It just... doesn't work.:::0:::2/4
Some more whine with your waffling? All of you?:::0:::2/10
How Do You Know is more Why Should I Care, and I can't honestly say I recommend you rush out to see it.:::0:::None
While the characters are interesting, their emotional connections are frayed and fragmented, leaving them floundering in this complicated dramedy.:::0:::4/10
Unfortunately, this dull and listless movie fails to live up to expectations and will be competing for Razzies rather than Academy Awards as one of the worst movies of the year.:::0:::1.5/4
We now know 'Spanglish' wasn't a fluke. Writer/director Brooks' artistic decline continues with How Do You Know:::0:::2/4
Brooks' latest grown-up comedy -- as glossy as it appears, as gracefully as it unfolds, as charming as its impressive, all-star cast often is -- arrives as a mild misfire.:::0:::2.5/4
Often as likable as a frolicking puppy -- and always as messy.:::0:::2.5/4
I still like James L. Brooks movies. He lost most people after Spanglish so they probably won't like How Do You Know either, but I appreciate a romantic comedy where people talk about what's actually going on.:::1:::None
Brooks was more interested in psychobabble mantras, as whole conversations in the movie are made up of such nonsense, to the point where the characters are simply robots who spout therapeutic gibberish.:::0:::None
Slow when it should be snappy and fragmented and unfocused when it should be crystal clear. (Parental Review also Available):::0:::None
...a good, though not great, romantic comedy that entertains because of its stars. The story is a pedestrian boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl yarn but the actors make it better.:::1:::B
Brooks has given us the rare contemporary rom-com that's by turns (if intermittently) thoughtful and funny, and that doesn't feel focus-grouped, cynical, misogynist, or mean. It seems ungenerous not to cut such a generous movie a break.:::1:::None
Despite James L. Brooks' sterling track record and a strong cast, this flat, fumbling film is dud on arrival.:::0:::D
How do you know if a romantic comedy isn't working? Generally if it's neither especially romantic, nor particularly comic. And in this picture, no matter how many times he keeps coming up to bat, Brooks keeps striking out.:::0:::2/4
How Do You Know isn't Brooks' best. Witherspoon is too uneasy in her role. But thanks to Rudd, plus Kathryn Hahn as... George's loyal secretary and Nicholson as his father, it delivers a number of delights.:::1:::2.5/4
Have you heard of "a comedy of manners?" Well, the two-hour waste of talent How Do You Know is a comedy of over-cooked mannerisms.:::0:::2/5
The payoff for sitting through How Do You Know is as predictable as it gets.:::0:::C
It's been six years since the last James Brooks comedy, so we might have expected a little rust. But not this weathered thing -- How Do You Know is so oxidized it's stuck.:::0:::2/4
A thoroughly enjoyable and surprisingly lightweight romantic comedy from writer-director James L. Brooks.:::1:::B
Clever lines and a fine performance by Owen Wilson aren't enough to redeem this flat and oddly unnerving comedy.:::0:::2/5
Witherspoon, whose movie characters often exhibit a whim of iron even though they have a Barbie twinkle, is well cast.:::1:::B-
Complex romcom is sweet, if not a home run.:::1:::3/5
Witherspoon... does the best she can with her unforgiving role... but no one could get us honestly past the notion that we're meant to take all these characters as delightfully oddball when they are quite clearly pathological.:::0:::None
Brooks never supplies a definitive answer to the open-ended title, but I think most everybody would agree you just know when it's right. And in the case of How Do You Know, when it's not.:::0:::2/5
...intermittently enjoyable, but like its characters too neurotic and uptight to get out of its own way.:::1:::C+
Overall, "How Do You Know" is a cozy diversion, an upscale date-night movie.:::1:::3/4
If anyone could have saved the stagnant cinematic genre, it would be Brooks. Sadly, How Do You Know is as creatively confused as its title.:::0:::2.5/5
...a watchable yet disappointing work from a filmmaker whose best days are clearly behind him.:::1:::2.5/4
How Do You Know is a well-written romantic comedy that stays away from formulas and cliches. I loved James L. Brooks' use of the close-up shot to show raw emotion.:::1:::3.5/5
Feels like three bad movies instead of one good one. Not as bad as SPANGLISH, but stil...:::0:::5/10
"How Do You Know" is a bit slow to get started, and it's nowhere near as funny as "The Hangover." But it'll make you smile.:::1:::3/4
Sometimes it's more jock than jocular. Occasionally, the camera lens lingers on Owen Wilson's crooked schnoz or Reese Witherspoon's prudish grimaces a bit too long. But it's is never too cute, except in omitting the question mark from its title.:::1:::2.5/4
Brooks is a distinctive writer who has a biting wit and a feel for the very human quality of ambivalence.:::1:::2.5/4
How Do You Know is not up there in Broadcast News's immortal empyrean, but it's close to the mismatched-trio comedy of As Good as It Gets.:::1:::None
The product of an out-of-touch filmmaker that never really gets to second base.:::0:::1.5/4
...every clear-eyed observation of how adult humans court affection must be pulped and sugared, refined into treacle.:::0:::79/100
It's the kind of movie that succeeds as a culmination of moments that ring true and sweet.:::1:::2.5/4
[A] film of sentimental perceptivity delivered by some of the most amiable and charismatic actors working today. Sad then that it is not a great film thanks to a series of critical miscalculations by its acclaimed writer/director.:::0:::5/10
It's glossy and entirely forgettable, but the friendly, funny cast makes it worth seeing.:::1:::B-
In a tour de force of unassuming verbal and physical comedy, Paul Rudd has given us the big screen's first answer to Arrested Development's Michael Bluth.:::1:::B-
...the film is directed in a way that seems a trifle theatrical, or even sitcom-ish...:::0:::2/5
How do you know you're watching How Do You Know? When you start dreaming of crossword puzzles and Diane Keaton.:::0:::1.5/4
It is at times capable of achieving the same Brooksian magic of Broadcast News or As Good As It Gets, and at others feels like Brooks is lamely impersonating his previous work:::1:::3.5/5
You may be able to ignore [its]flaws yet as the cinematic equivalent of an ice cream sundae with far too many ingredients, you may end up feeling a bit queasy afterwards.:::0:::2/5
Not prime Brooks, but good enough.:::1:::3.0/4.0
Is "How Do You Know" schmaltzy and manipulative and not entirely convincing as a portrait drawn from real life? Sure -- and it's also richly, goofily funny, loaded with terrific actors and delicious moments...:::1:::None
"How Do You Know," his latest, is a near miss. A film that is completely in love with the sound of its human voices, this is a rather slim romantic comedy featuring a love triangle involving hugely appealing Reese Witherspoon in an odd role.:::0:::B-
Foregoing substantial character development for a lot of back-and-forth squabbling between people who can't make up their minds, the film is often frustrating in its dumbed-down repetitiveness.:::0:::2/4
The problem is that for most of the running time, How Do You Know meanders and has a hard time finding the right tone, lurching forward from one scene to the next.:::0:::C
What's truly perplexing about the failures of How Do You Know is that the film was written and directed by James L. Brooks, a master of the rom-com genre.:::0:::1.5/4
A dour sort-of romantic drama with an A-list cast, a few comic moments and the disjointed sense of talented filmmakers flapping their arms in an effort to make it fly.:::0:::1.5/4
Gradually, you're reminded why Brooks gave us so much good television over the years, in addition to his better movies, chief among them "Broadcast News.":::1:::3/4
An airless, sometimes distressingly mirthless comedy.:::0:::2/5
Brooks can rightly lay claim to a dizzying film and TV resume, but an effort like this should be advertised as being "from the man who brought you 'Spanglish.'":::0:::C-
It does some of what it sets out to accomplish and most viewers will depart the theater with at least the beginnings of a warm, fuzzy feeling. These days, it's hard to ask for much more.:::1:::2.5/4
A film by the painstaking James L. Brooks that is so eager to ask the question about true love, it doesn't have time to mess with boring punctuation.:::0:::2.5/4
How do you know a movie is a total loss? When you watch it with a heavy heart, and sit through it like a stone.:::0:::None
Though all the pieces are in place for an amusing romance, "How Do You Know" (the title refers to knowing when you're in love) doesn't work out as it should.:::0:::2.5/5
Pure sitcom fluff, a silly story about a romantic triangle [in which] wit, charm, style and comic timing are all absent.:::0:::D+
It is not funny; it is not heartwarming. It has all the zesty champagne fizz of Pepto-Bismol.:::0:::None
Sitting in the theater, my affection was definitely on-again, off-again at best. But in the end, the good times, which were fantastic, won me over.:::1:::2.5/4
This is most certainly not as good as it gets.:::0:::5/10
Agreeable but disappointingly bland...:::0:::2/4
I like a movie that is, like its leads, endearingly messy and subverts our genre expectations. Brooks colors outside the lines.:::1:::B+
There's a lot of talk in How Do You Know, but not much worth saying.:::0:::2/4
It is a keenly observed movie about loss of identity and finding love, in which Brooks serves up funny-ouch humor with slapstick heartbreak.:::1:::3/4
James L. Brooks wrote and directed "How Do You Know,'' and in addition to forgetting a question mark, he's also misplaced his point.:::0:::2.5/4
Paul Rudd is an American treasure - America's Male Sweetheart - and he carries the film effortlessly:::1:::B
The result is highly entertaining but hardly ranks with the director's best work.:::1:::None
How do you know when to cut your losses and go see something else?:::0:::1/5
Preposterous characters lurching through painfully contrived scenarios.:::0:::C-
An object lesson in how not to use likable stars.:::0:::C
A more than passable night out if you're fed up with the usual rom-com conventions.:::1:::2.5/4
Reese Witherspoon and Paul Rudd give winning performances in an otherwise vapid, expensive romantic comedy that just tries too hard.:::0:::None
we don't care about the things they are worrying about...we are lost in the intricacies of Rudd's relationship with his corrupt p---- of a father (Nicholson)...a career disaster for Reese Witherspoon, who needs a flop like a hole in the head.:::0:::C-
It feels less like a coherent narrative than a series of vignettes in which the characters say improbably witty things and act in ways that aren't tethered to rational behavior. We sense them performing for the camera.:::0:::3.5/5
A sometimes-amusing moron.:::0:::2.5/5
The movie is all surface and trades on fortune-cookie wisdom and sitcom scenarios.:::0:::2.5/4
I expected this movie to be better.:::0:::2/4
There are a couple of scenes of pure, sentimental genius, as well as appealingly boggled turns by Rudd and Wilson.:::1:::7.5/10
How do you know when a film is horrible? When it's How Do You Know, it's pretty obvious.:::0:::None
The ''funny'' moments are whiffed, the dialogue is ''scene-y,'' and each reaction shot is held a second or ten too long, leaving the actors hanging.:::0:::C+
Misguided, frighteningly comatose tale of love and neuroses; a maze of bad ideas that Brooks robotically assembles. He's surviving this picture, not directing it.:::0:::D-
How Do You Know gets by on witty and realistic dialogue even when its story is sloppy.:::1:::3.5/5
Terrific performances by the entire cast, especially Rudd and Wilson, make this romcom very entertaining, even though it's a bit too long:::1:::8/10
How Do You Know takes the wholly possible scenario of two decent men courting one woman and turns it into a forced lark that can't bring itself to ask if she's worth it.:::0:::2/5
A low-impact romantic comedy-drama from James L. Brooks in which the central characters are strangely disconnected from one another as well as from the audience.:::0:::None
How do you know when the spark is gone? When your latest romantic comedy looks like TV, feels like greeting-card poetry and sounds like a self-help manual.:::0:::None
How Do You Know is a terrible title for a not-much-better movie, missing a question mark and most of the point with romantic comedies. James L. Brooks' film is rarely romantic and barely amusing, dashing any hope that Spanglish was just a fluke.:::0:::C-
Another romantic comedy triangle from James L. Brooks, with a scandalized executive coming between paired athletes--but neither the dialogue nor plot supply an answer (or a question mark) to the title.:::0:::2/4
Six years in the making and this is As Good As It Gets?:::0:::2/4
How Do You Know forges a difficult exploration of its characters' weaknesses and uncertainties. But its deepening drama becomes wishy-washy.:::0:::None
Though daling with a relevant issue, James L. Brooks' new serio comedy suffers from uneven writing, tentative approach to narrative and characters, hesitancy about specific ending, and slow pacing.:::0:::C
Considering how many great films have been influenced by Brooks' earlier work, it's hard to believe how badly this movie fails.:::0:::3/10
Scenes take twice as long as they should, but we do learn how 'triangulated' people make romantic choices.:::1:::B
Before it wraps up that question like the obedient Hollywood love story it eventually has to be, How Do You Know takesThe heralded "violent" scene practically screams "We need domestic distribution!" I don't think anyone in this movie actually likes this movie.:::0:::D+
The end result is an overlong adaptation that primarily comes off as a complete and total misfire...:::0:::2/4
The Film Critic Inside Me ...:::0:::None
Affleck is great here.:::1:::3/5
An excellent film which takes some big, brave steps in the crime genre...:::1:::3/5
Jim Thompson's 1952 novel upon which this is based was supposedly unfilmable: perhaps that was the correct assessment.:::0:::None
This adaptation of Thompson's 1952 novel about a cunning, psychotic sheriff's deputy in a small Texas town locates the killer inside him and immerses us in the cold calculation and horrible logic that pull him from one murder to the next.:::1:::None
full review at Movies for the Masses:::1:::3.5/5
Casey Affleck delivers a chilling performance as a sociopathic deputy sheriff whose charming veneer shatters as we're introduced to his taste for violence of both the straight-up and sexual kinds.:::1:::3/5
[Affleck's] commitment to such a vile character, even in spite of Winterbottom's occasionally questionable direction, displays a fearlessness that is rarely seen in cinema today.:::1:::3.5/5
The violence is not shown in an ironic fashion. It's put front and center and is visceral in a way nothing else is in the film.:::1:::3/5
Dark thriller centers on brutal violence against women.:::1:::3/5
It's a credit to the British director that he's captured so much regional and class detail, but disappointing that his film's conclusions are almost banal, with a contrived finale that ties too many threads together.:::0:::None
It's Winterbottom's first entry into dark noir, and I think a more seasoned hand in the genre would have given Lou's horrible actions their proper moral weight.:::0:::2/4
Viewers are invited to spend these torpid minutes burrowing into Lou's back story in search of reasons why he is off his rocker. But this is one movie psycho that defies all amateur psychoanalysis.:::0:::1/5
Winterbottom's film is really rather down beat and hard to take. Perhaps that's only just so. Lou's heart of darkness takes us to a dead end. It's the kind of violent movie where you just want all the bloody mayhem to stop.:::0:::3/5
It's a violent film about violence, but that makes it truthful.:::1:::4/5
Sex and violence take centre stage in the enthralling, if a little overcooked crime thriller, The Killer Inside Me.:::1:::3.5/5
This is compelling and challenging cinema, punctuated with genuinely shocking moments, by a director and a cast of actors who are right at the top of their game.:::1:::4.5/5
Probably the best adaptation of Thompson to date (with The Grifters a very close second), but his work's yet to get the movie it really deserves.:::1:::None
An engrossing, chilling portrait of a psychopath unraveling.:::1:::None
The Killer Inside Me ultimately registers as a startling curio that you may gasp at now but forget later.:::0:::None
One dry patch of desert:::0:::None
A lethal brew of misogynistic, sadistic horrors, Michael Winterbottom's carefully crafted psychological noir thriller, as told from the point of view of a killer, is disturbing in the extreme:::0:::None
Sometimes works, sometimes scores a near-hit and sometimes doesn't work at all, but is invariably fascinating throughout.:::1:::4/5
A vast miscalculation.:::0:::2/5
One of the most repellent and reprehensible movies in recent memory.:::0:::1.5/4
It's too well made to dismiss outright for its twisted cruelty. Maybe that's a compliment, maybe not.:::1:::B
uneven, but fascinatingly nasty adaptation of Thompson's 1952 novel:::1:::3/4
It's a fine idea to turn Affleck's squawky self-assurance into a lens on sociopathy, but Winterbottom and co-writer John Curran seem neither to examine nor to indulge, and the result feels strangely inconsequential.:::1:::3/5
Like much of Winterbottom's genre-hopping, this venture into dusty western noir fits him surprisingly well the first time he slips it on; though it could still do with a few alterations.:::1:::6.5/10
If in the end it doesn't fully capture the malignant brilliance of its source...there's enough Thompson in it to make that sick puppy Lou Ford a guy worth spending a couple of hours with.:::1:::B-
What a crock.:::1:::1.5/4
It's still near impossible to capture Jim Thompson's Godlessness on film:::1:::C+
Feminists, look away now.:::0:::2/5
Winterbottom frequently cuts away to period rockabilly and country jukebox tunes, as if he were shying away from Thompson's nastiness. And maybe he should.:::1:::None
If you dig the mushy, muffled sound of a man's fist slamming into a woman's mottled face while her jawbone quietly shatters, this is the movie for you.:::0:::None
Little, however, can save The Killer Inside Me from its worst impulses, its reveling in brute violence that makes it hard to watch and nearly impossible to admire, even though it's carefully crafted.:::0:::2/4
Casey Affleck is suprisingly good as Ford.:::1:::7/10
This is a work of stylish, existentialist brutality, filled with beautiful women and damaged men.:::1:::3/5
As for the misogynist brutality, it is indeed depraved, made more so by the fact that its female victims are depicted as loving their abuse right up until it turns murderous.:::0:::1/4
The director only submits up a faintly bewildering man with little expression, in a film barely motivated beyond its pulp trappings.:::0:::None
Boasting a shockingly nasty turn by baby-faced, baby-voiced Casey Affleck in the title role, the film is one of Winterbottom's best (only "Tristram Shandy" and "24 Hour Party People" are as fine), although moviegoers should beware: the film features two h:::1:::A-
The question of Winterbottom's intent here isn't easily answered, but the power of his abuse scenes is undeniable.:::1:::B-
It's an intriguing more-than-meets-the-eye experiment in point of view.:::1:::3/4
Director Michael Winterbottom... projects such profound disinterest in the material that even the most appalling moments come across through a thick layer of gauze and insipidness.:::0:::5/10
To his credit, Affleck avoids making Lou suggest a reboot of Robert. He's pushy and cowardly, but in a more calculating way, and he's sadistically sexual in a way that Robert never was.:::1:::3/4
It's a psychologically haunting portrait of an extreme personality, an amoral, violent, lonely man.:::1:::3.5/4
The film, sunbaked noir delivered with disturbing savagery and finesse, does its source material full justice.:::1:::3/4
A film noir so steeped in ugliness it's difficult to enjoy on any level.:::0:::None
Jim Thompson might be the darkest of noir writers, but Michael Winterbottom's version of Thompson's 1952 novel reduces its mirthful nihilism to lurid unpleasantness.:::0:::2.5/4
Full of nice little touches, but somehow misses the mark when it comes to the big picture.:::0:::2.5/4
If you're a noir fan interested in seeing a unique modern take on the timeless genre, don't miss this challenging but often fascinating drama.:::1:::None
It comes across like a remake of Russ Meyer's immortal "Supervixens" made by people who have inexplicably chosen to play it both straight and at the wrong speed.:::0:::2/5
Winterbottom has crafted a handsome film about the ugliness of the worst of human nature and, in the process, given us a fascinating dissection of genre mechanics.:::1:::3.5/4
A classic crime novel is given an adaptation that pulls no punches:::1:::50/100
Winterbottom was right to keep the light and compositions flat and bright and eerily sunny, no matter what sort of evilness Lou perpetrates. But the story should grow progressively more reckless-seeming and feverish; instead, it is methodical to a fault.:::0:::2/4
Little more than torture porn tricked out in art-house finery.:::0:::2/5
A disappointment, even if you're intrigued by the phrase 'Rough sex with Jessica Alba.':::0:::2.5/5
There is a point beyond which Lou's implacability brings diminishing returns. While I admire Affleck's performance, I believe Winterbottom and his writer, John Curran, may have miscalculated.:::0:::2.5/4
" A surprisingly patient, observational portrait of insanity.":::1:::None
Affleck's Lou Ford is a fascinating character, and it's interesting to watch his mental and emotional journey.:::1:::3/5
Winterbottom is in Mike Figgis mode, offering grossly violent filmnoir cliches, made of punching-bag-face make-up, gratuitous sex and Dark Knight nihilism...:::0:::None
It's one thing on the page, where you're almost as horrified by the idea of some person actually writing this as you are by what you're reading. But on the screen, actually watching it happen, it begins to fall apart.:::0:::2.5/4
It's a character study of a sociopath, and works as such...as narrative or titillation, a lot less so.:::1:::None
John Curran's script can be faulted for leaning too heavily on the childhood roots of Lou's psychosis, but the movie does Thompson proud. It's a scorcher.:::1:::3/4
The Killer Inside Me is hard to watch -- occasionally impossible to watch -- but it never looks away from the hard, isolate, stoic killer at its dark heart, and it makes sure we can't either.:::1:::4/5
You may feel a twinge of sympathy for this monster, a strange and vivid character who deserves all the torments of hell, and also a better movie.:::0:::2.5/5
There's no resonance, only impact.:::1:::3/5
Raspy-voiced Affleck turns in an amazingly controlled performance as a natural-born killer, with strong backup from the supporting cast.:::1:::3/4
Affleck is playing someone split down the middle, but we're stuck seeing only one side of him.:::1:::3/5
In this terrific, magnetic performance, Affleck is a bit charismatic, somewhat awkward, and utterly despicable, all at the same time:::1:::B+
Thompson's novel is elegant in its bluntness and cruelty, as efficient as a closed fist -- you can turn away from it, but you can't escape it. But there's no subtle way to put this: Winterbottom's version goes too far.:::0:::None
..a handsomely mounted production with a flippant rockabilly soundtrack and hollow emotional core. Incendiary as it tries to be, "The Killer Inside Me" left me pretty cold.:::0:::C
captures Thompson's pulp brutality and delivers it without any varnish of fantasy or cinematic trickery:::1:::3.5/5
Winterbottom captures the atmosphere of a dusty community where everyone knows everybody's history, and where money and power can only sway public opinion to a point.:::1:::B-
No movie for old men, or any other demographic for that matter.:::0:::1/4
Winterbottom is better envisioning Killer Inside Me than he is executing it, surrendering a magnificently photographed picture of hot noir blood, but spoiling the tone by remaining so aloof and ineffective.:::0:::C-
An adequate if unexceptional film noir throwback becomes something altogether less tolerable in its brutal depictions of ... violence against women.:::0:::2/5
The Killer Inside Me may be the darkest film noir ever made.:::1:::B-
While the individual moments of brutality are powerful, the pacing of the film as a whole tends to lag. The suspense should be suffocating.:::0:::None
None of this makes sense; no character motivation is ever analyzed; and by the time the end credits roll, everyone in the film is dead already. The film is seriously lacking in a sense of redemption, and I couldn't find a moral purpose with a spyglass.:::0:::None
Winterbottom's inability to bring off this lurid stew of sex and violence is one problem; his (mis)direction of Affleck is another.:::0:::2/5
Skillful but aloof, unable to truly burrow into and reflect its protagonist's psychosexual madness.:::0:::C+
The poster is stronger than any image in the movie.:::0:::None
Winterbottom delves into Coen Brothers territory and delivers one of his best-looking movies as well as one that's far more cinematic than what we've normally seen from him.:::1:::8.5/10
As much The Kisser Inside Me as anything else, the film endlessly alternates between redneck raw sex involving well, bible belts as erotic female necktie foreplay, and elaborate slaughter. And a torture porn carnage inflicted on oddly forgiving females.:::0:::None
Style (and the uber-creepy performance by Casey Affleck) inject the film with an energy and tension that almost compensate for its flaws.:::1:::None
Gripping and disturbing new screen adaptation of the Texas-set Jim Thompson crime novel.:::1:::None
The result isn't drama so much as a waking nightmare of play-acting and predestined doom.:::0:::2.5/4
Casey Affleck's high, raspy voice almost sinks this violent film.:::1:::B-
Even though the one sustained sequence of violence has already caused controversy, possibly more than it deserves, this Killer is stylish and convincing.:::1:::4/5
Winterbottom has said that movie violence shouldn't be pretty. And, clearly, he's got a point. It's a pity then, given the director's bravado, that his film's flaws are basic.:::0:::None
This is not a film that lets you off the hook or allows you to avert your eyes. Commendable in its own way but not something I would rush to recommend.:::1:::3/5
Winterbottom's harsh, naturalistic approach pretty much kills any dramatic momentum or tension by exposing the mechanics of Thompson's pulpy plotting for what it is and failing to compensate with any real psychological insights.:::0:::2/5
The Killer Inside Me undoubtedly touches upon compelling subjects, but having done so, doesn't appear to know quite what to do next.:::0:::3/5
It didn't always work for me,but this is one of Winterbottom's most ambitious films, and it's good to see that he's continuing to stretch himself.:::1:::3/5
Stylish, sweatily seductive and boasts career-best performances from the leads. It's just let down by a plot that runs out of steam 40 minutes before the end.:::1:::3/5
A baffling film. Not just the narrative, but the motives behind making it.:::0:::2/5
This is, for long stretches, a listless, meandering film that's not helped by Affleck's deliberately introverted, almost opaque performance.:::0:::2/5
If the climax undermines the sociological purpose of the journey into the dark side of the loon, you'll never forget Lou Ford's personal descent into hell.:::1:::3/5
Crucially, the film fails to coherently convey the fact that Lou is an unreliable narrator and that what he tells us might not be true, something that would help explain the characterisation of the women and distance the film from his view of them.:::0:::None
Here is a film whose subject is violence's human and inhuman toll -- and violence's sickly ubiquity even in places and times that seem to promise freedom from it.:::1:::5/5
The violence isn't the problem. It's the rest of the film that's not quite right.:::1:::3/5
British director Michael Winterbottom adapts the classic pulp fiction of American novelist Jim Thompson here, but something gets lost in translation.:::0:::2/5
Winterbottom keeps Thompson's bleakness intact, leaving us little to engage with. But the film has an earth beauty and is a haunting look at the dark side of being human.:::1:::3/5
Thompson fans should rejoice at seeing a film that truly captures the dark heart of this great novelist's work.:::1:::4/5
Taking a cold, cruel plunge into its sociopath's world, Winterbottom's latest genre swerve is an accomplished neo-noir.:::1:::4/5
Beautifully shot, superbly written and genuinely chilling, this is a gripping noir thriller with a terrific central performance from Casey Affleck.:::1:::4/5
This again-atypical film from Winterbottom is a much more sober affair than its early, controversial press might suggest.:::1:::4/5
As darkly disturbing as Jim Thompson's novel, this is a genuinely upsetting film that might also be Winterbottom's best. Not for everyone, but near-faultless all the same.:::1:::4/5
Ultimately, the images stay with you for all the wrong reasons.:::0:::2/5
Uncompromising and wickedly entertaining ... Casey Affleck leads a rich ensemble cast.:::1:::None
Here is a movie that is destined to become a cult film in spite of its glaring flaws.:::1:::B-
David Lynch might have made something subversive out of these off-putting elements. Winterbottom has no idea what to do.:::0:::1/4
A bit too silly for its own good ... Yet even if this is my least favorite Winterbottom since 9 Songs, I' an unexpectedly candid detour through how incredibly hard just following that directive has become.:::1:::None
Witherspoon's charm...has been replaced with tentativeness, confusion and the exaggerated facial expressions of a sitcom comedienne.:::0:::2/5
Brooks' script is more hit than miss, but it is hit-and-miss nonetheless. Probably too studied in its approach to grab a mass audience.:::1:::None
The sad part is that How Do You Know is nowhere near as dumb as it looks. A couple of comic set pieces are inspired -- or would be, if Brooks's timing weren't off.:::0:::None

Love? Actually, no. More like disappointment, and, at times, hatred.:::0:::1/5
A long running time, too many characters and too much whimsy and corn make this romantic romp more of a slog than a souffle.:::0:::None
Romantic and entertaining -- for older teens.:::1:::5/5
Bombastic audience-hooting moments aside, Curtis has written his most accomplished film, finding the energy to direct the hell out of it as well. And it's even gloriously R-rated to boot.:::1:::A
Despite it's naivety, this is one of the most beautiful and heart warming movies to come around in years...:::1:::None
Loads of fun as long as your expectations aren't overly raised by the hype, the cast and the taglines.:::1:::None
Transfixed by the taboos of the...British class system, Curtis seems to think that nothing could be more erotic than the subordinate who fetches tea or dusts the crockery.:::0:::None
For the cuddlers out there who like things a little too light and fluffy.:::0:::None
Disconcertingly lubricious.:::0:::None
This is cloying, deceitful, and more or less irresistible.:::1:::None
Without ever sounding a false note, this endearing ensemble holiday flick manages to be nuttier than Notting Hill, more satisfying than Bridget Jones' Diary, and even more intricate than Four Weddings and a Funeral.:::1:::4/4
It's a perfectly respectable debut for Curtis.:::1:::3/5
Plenty of entertainment in this well acted ensemble comedy that Robert Altman could easily have put his name on.:::1:::3.5/4
This is an embarrassment, an overdrawn rom-com gone very wrong.:::0:::None
The film lives up to its hype.:::1:::3/5
Curtis has created a joyful, entertaining date movie that'll leave you with a smile on your face and an almost irresistible urge to hug somebody.:::1:::A
This is definitely a case of a writer-turned-director that is too in love with his own script to make hard choices about what to keep and what to cut.:::0:::1.5/5
Funny? Maybe. Not to me.:::0:::3/10
Curtis has lost none of his touch, though the ending is somewhat muddled and 135 minutes is very long, even for a good romantic comedy.:::1:::None
A highly engineered puffball.:::0:::None
A charming little film that, unfortunately, gets carried away with itself and never quite makes the grade.:::0:::59/100
It's tart and amusing but carries a slightly cloying aftertaste.:::1:::3/4
My problem is an acute allergy to repitition. Love, Actually and other champions of the romantic-comedy flyweight division make me break out in hives.:::0:::None
Ten romantic comedies rolled into one.:::1:::B+
In the end the film is just as winsome and sugary as its facile message: "love, actually, is all around.":::0:::2/5
It wants to swirl round the world and find love in every cranny, but it doesn't have the effortless rush of energy that it would need to make the masses of plot come together.:::0:::2/4
One character goes on about the 'total agony' of being in love. That's nothing compared to the agony of watching these people in the agonies of love.:::0:::None
While the movie is occasionally charming, the souffle falls flat in the end ...:::0:::2/4
Impressive, if self-indulgent directing debut.:::1:::3/4
Upon first viewing, it is something of a guilty pleasure. Upon second viewing, it is simply a pleasure.:::1:::3/4
This kind of comedy has just hit the wall.:::0:::2/5
There's simply too much here to digest.:::0:::2/5
Screenwriter Richard Curtis tries to direct, puts too many eggs in his basket, and winds up with a very runny omelette.:::0:::2/4
Curtis repeats and reiterates these themes to the point that it's just as redundant as saying that someone repeats and reiterates in the same statement.:::0:::1.5/4
'Encantadora, romantica y magica, es una de esa cintas que cualquiera que aun crea en la bondad humana y en lo hermoso de las relaciones personales va a disfrutar como nadie':::1:::3/4
Love Actually is cheerful and undeniably romantic and, despite its flaws, you'd be hard-pressed to sit through the credits without smiling.:::1:::None
Sitting through 128 minutes of this much aggressive charm and wit is like being mugged in slow motion by beautiful people from the pages of Vanity Fair.:::0:::2/4
All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie until, in the end, it went somewhat bonkers with what amounted to a communal love fest on Christmas Eve.:::1:::None
Whatever the actors are given to do they make so delightful -- or so delightfully moving -- that Love Actually wins out over its wobbles.:::1:::None
The year's busiest and most relentlessly shameless comedy. It's also among the year's funniest and most disarming.:::1:::B+
Jamais deixa de ser envolvente, ja que Curtis, um escritor experiente, e habil na construcao das historias, que sao recheadas com seu humor tipicamente britanico.:::1:::5/5
It tries to cover all aspects of love and succeeds far better than you would expect it to.:::1:::A
There's good acting in Love Actually, but director Richard Curtis threatens to take the cool out of London.:::1:::None
Richard Curtis is so earnest ... that what otherwise might seem overly sentimental and cloying comes across as genuinely touching:::1:::3/4
Peppered with so many moments of raw, affecting honesty that it's intensely difficult to dislike -- and tempting to forgive Richard Curtis for not finishing what he starts,:::0:::2.5/4
Classy, so long as you approach it without thought, basic narrative understanding, and resistance to unearned sentiment.:::0:::None
You'll laugh! You'll cry! And you'll go home feeling ever so slightly used...:::1:::3/5
'Why make one good romantic comedy when you can make nine bad ones?':::0:::None
I'll take an overly sentimental movie over a sardonic one any day - particularly around the holidays. Now if I only Santa would tuck Hugh under my Christmas tree.:::1:::4/5
This movie contains everything except Bridget Jones, actually.:::1:::3.5/4
[Curtis'] sheer glee is infectious. He's playing us like fiddles, we know he's playing us like fiddles, and he knows that we know, and everyone loves it.:::1:::3/4
When a situation becomes intriguing, writer-director Curtis develops ADD and shifts focus. Fortunately, the cast and Curtis' eye for absurdly comic situations wins out.:::1:::3/4
Like the holiday season itself, the movie overwhelms you, but in an agreeable way.:::1:::None
Go, you weapy-eyed romantics. It's too long but mostly fun, actually.:::1:::3.5/5
Directorial debut of Brit-com master Richard Curtis is a big, bright ensemble tale with many delights -- and absolutely no surprises.:::1:::4/5
An utterly charming, classy and uproarious work of romantic hopefulness.:::1:::3.5/4
Love, Actually" is a bit sluggish at times, the film's good nature and wit grows on you.:::1:::3/4
This shouldn&#8217;t work, it&#8217;s so obvious and unconvincing and overdone, yet I have to admit that the damn movie got to me.:::1:::2.5/4
Richard Curtis has, with this 4th Working Title chick flick, possibly ruined it for all men by just getting what women want in an onscreen man, - we're not complaining.:::1:::5/5
Warm, bittersweet and hilarious, this is lovely, actually. Prepare to be smitten.:::1:::4/5
The hollowness of the stories that lie behind each of these shameless heart-grabbers, laugh-getters and tear-jerkers becomes quickly apparent.:::0:::2.5/5
There were times watching this movie when I felt I was being force-fed 30 pounds of creme brulee.:::0:::2/4
... a terrific film.:::1:::None
Runs long and gets silly at times, but it is not embarrassed to be a simple, happy film that affirms life and love.:::1:::3/4
Hellish, protracted, and by turns so sickly sweet and disturbingly caustic that it must stand as one of the worst films of the year.:::0:::0/4
Hugh Grant, aging gracefully here, effortlessly utters some of the funniest lines of Richard Curtis's directorial debut.:::1:::None
It's terrific fun for an hour, but by the last of its 129 minutes you might find yourself going into insulin shock.:::1:::None
Love Actually is impossible to dislike... no matter how cynically we might try.:::1:::B-
Love is a many-splendored thing, but this film could have done with more of the splendor and not so much of the many.:::1:::3/5
It's not so much the individual storylines that grab you, but Curtis' unrelenting optimism.:::1:::3.5/5
...tremendously entertaining...:::1:::3/4
There are no fewer than nine interlocking and overlapping love stories in Richard Curtis' deadly epic sprawl of a romantic comedy, Love Actually. By the end of the movie, that's nine too many.:::0:::None
Any love these characters may or may not actually share is so innocuous, and so downright false, that it sadly becomes invisible.:::0:::C
Curtis continues to find new twists on old romantic comedy stand-bys:::1:::B+
There's enough that's right about Love to compensate for what's wrong with it.:::1:::None
If listing the cast of Love Actually is exhausting, it's even more tiring to watch it.:::0:::None
Love Actually is irresistible.:::1:::3/4
Curtis's directing debut is frequently funny, generally fizzy and occasionally piercingly perceptive about the price love exacts.:::1:::3.5/5
A form of emotional hardcore.:::0:::2/5
Love Actually is not so much great as it is so blissfully, swooningly romantic that it's rendered irresistible.:::1:::3/4
It's no hardship whatsoever to sit through Love Actually ... But if Curtis could have sharpened his focus, and trusted his actors a bit more, Love Actually could have been splendid.:::1:::2.5/4
An audience-pleaser, but very calculated and far from Curtis' best work.:::1:::B-
Love Actually , Curtis' holiday-themed directing debut, abandons any pretext of sophistication for gloppy sentimentality, sugary pop songs and bawdy humor -- an approach that works about half the time.:::0:::2/4
A good movie, but it could have been a great one...tries so hard to be a grand ensemble that it loses focus and settles for some easy laughs...And not enough of my man Hugh.:::1:::None
The performances are tokens of charm, attitude, Brit schtick, and the writer achieves the structure of confetti.:::0:::None
Call me Scrooge, but I sincerely hope that this film does not become a Christmas perennial.:::0:::2/4
All too rare is the holiday film that not only makes you feel good, but also is good. Love Actually works.:::1:::8/10
Only the most hard-hearted and cynical won't find something endearing in Love Actually.:::1:::3/4
The only time [the movie] doesn't stink is when it's candidly admitting that it stinks.:::0:::None
It's too busy with too many stories to tell. But there's so much heart and silly fun and genuine sentiment here, delivered by an A-list of Brit and American talent that it's hard to fault.:::1:::3/5
Too full of sweet sticky stuff for even the starry-eyed to stomach.:::0:::C+
Yet another pandering, half-baked romantic comedy.:::0:::None
Slick but uneven romantic comedy.:::0:::2.5/4
This movie is so unfunny, uninspired and unoriginal I swear it could have started out as a club-footed Coen Brothers vehicle for George Clooney.:::0:::None
For a fairy tale, Love Actually is highly entertaining.:::1:::2.5/4
Finally, a delightful piece of Christmas fluff to chase away visions of chainsaw-wielding serial killers.:::1:::3.5/4
[Curtis] is nothing if not capable of creating merry, madcap romantic comedy, and he punctuates the purposely hackneyed developments and labyrinthian structure with sly wit and sprightly pacing.:::1:::3/4
There's so much plot being thrown at us in Love Actually that there's little room for genuine emotion; the film is as superficial as a Jay Leno monologue.:::0:::2/4
A totally bewitching comedy that has as much to say to the intellect as it does to the heart.:::1:::4.5/5
There is probably something for everybody in this movie. If you don't like some segment, and the people in it, just wait a few minutes.:::1:::3.5/5
Curtis shows the same eccentric humanism and charm that gave him Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill.:::1:::A
Finally, here is a genuine, warm-warming holiday movie for adults!:::1:::None
It pushes its 'love is good' message with such insistence, so many cheery pop tunes, airport hugs, coincidences and teary smiles, that it feels like one long commercial.:::0:::2.5/4
Perfectly wonderful if not completely perfect.:::1:::A
The pacing's off in places as well, and the movie is flabby and lightweight, feeling every bit as long as its 130 minutes. But the performances are quite good.:::1:::2.5/4
Love Actually won't last you. Still, while you're enjoying it: Yummy.:::1:::2.5/4
If you missed Four Weddings or Notting Hill, there's a good chance Love Actually will seem refreshing and delightful.:::1:::B-
The film has no plot but nine subplots, which are four too many.:::0:::None
Love Actually will delight moviegoers who think that more really is more. Cynics who prefer their twee without sugar are advised to look elsewhere.:::0:::2.5/4
Warm, wistful, whimsical.:::1:::7/10
It's shamelessly sentimental and proud of it. It's determined to wear you down and make you love it as much as it loves itself. It's too much -- and, yet, somehow, not enough.:::1:::B-
[A] perfectly wonderful, perfectly foolish movie, in that fool-for-love kind of way.:::1:::None
...an arrow from Cupid, and only the most cynical moviegoer would try to dodge it.:::1:::3.5/4
Call it a Christmas gift from Britain to the world; this film is undeniably charming and, for a holiday movie, sets the standard for the first years of the 21st century.:::1:::85/100
Unrequited love does not exist. In fact, there's so much requiting going on, we start wishing to see someone get dumped just to add a little excitement to the mix.:::0:::2.5/4
You can go into this expecting to be spoon-fed sugary sap until cotton candy churns out of your ears, and you'll still be surprised by the level of overkill.:::0:::D+
Rather sprawling in its portrayal of several love stories, the film strikes some appeal at times, and misses the mark at others.:::0:::2/4
The movie feels like Curtis pasted together pages from his sketchbook, throwing every good -- or bad -- idea into a single film.:::0:::2.5/4
Hope springs eternal, love is everywhere, and Keira Knightley is genetic perfection.:::1:::9.5/10
The movie's only flaw is also a virtue: It's jammed with characters, stories, warmth and laughs, until at times Curtis seems to be working from a checklist of obligatory movie love situations and doesn't want to leave anything out.:::1:::3.5/4
Love Actually plays like a greatest-hits album of modern British comedy, spinning all your favorite tunes in just the right order.:::1:::4/5
Love Actually isn't deep, but it can be amusing. If its parts are better than the whole, at least it has parts that provide real laughs.:::1:::B
The perfect Christmas confection.:::1:::3.5/4
There are enough stories in Love Actually that even if some don't appeal to you, others will.:::1:::3/4
It'll leave you feeling mushy in all the right ways.:::1:::B
From top to bottom, Love Actually is a sparkler.:::1:::3/4
Curtis throws every gag he can think of at the screen and the ones that don't stick, he throws again and again.:::0:::2.5/4
Love Actually, actually isn't half bad...the snafu is there's way too many stories going on at once...:::0:::2.5/4
A rambling and repetitive, sometimes enjoyable, mostly maddening treatise on love or, at least, an R-rated Hallmark version of it.:::0:::2.5/4
It's good for a few laughs, and its heart is in the right place. But I never believed a moment of it.:::0:::2.5/4
Delightful - the British accent makes everybody sexier and funnier.:::1:::4.5/5
You'd have to be a terrible grump to not like Love Actually at least a little.:::1:::2.5/4
More a garage sale of stories by writer-director Richard Curtis, Love Actually gives its underused British cast something to do with no Harry Potter film this year.:::0:::2/5
Mostly just wants the audience to feel good and revel in the warmth of a fresh attraction.:::1:::8/10
One of the most unabashedly romantic films I've ever seen.:::1:::3.5/4
While there are moments when it works beautifully, the overall result is much too insistent on an upbeat tone, stubbornly forcing the Christmas Spirit where it doesn't belong.:::1:::B-
There are enough characters here to populate a dozen movies, but not enough imagination for one.:::0:::None
The sentiment is in earnest, so lovers take heart:::1:::3/4
The performances are droll, every one of them, the dialogue wry and witty, and the emotional moments by turns poignant, wrenching and jubilant.:::1:::B+
Not only incredibly charming but it is arguably the wittiest and most completely satisfying romantic comedy to come along since 'Punch-Drunk Love.':::1:::None
It's comfort food for the holidays, easily digested and passed before the new year sets in and you resolve to swear off such rich and unhealthy edibles as this.:::1:::None
The creators of Love Actually clearly believe that if a movie has enough charm, it doesn't need depth. In the case of Love Actually, they are absolutely right.:::1:::B+
Love Actually is just about impossible to dislike, even if you really, really want to.:::1:::3/4
A patchwork of contrived naughtiness and forced pathos.:::0:::2/5
Love Actually is as stuffed with goodies as the Christmas stockings for those at the very top of Santa's 'nice' list -- and it is just as entertaining, too.:::1:::A
Though it would be dishonest to call this an unqualified success, it would be churlish not to tip the hat to Love Actually's genuine charm.:::1:::3/5
Writer-director Richard Curtis has jam-packed the story with too many characters and the whole thing borders on sickeningly sweet. But a fitfully funny screenplay and irreproachable cast keep you from suffering cinematic toothache.:::0:::6/10
Watching all this is like looking under the Christmas tree and finding everything you ever wanted (all those stars!) and everything you don't want (all that bathroom humor!) shoved into one carelessly wrapped package.:::0:::1/4
Like watching a dozen or so ultra-cute mini-movies simultaneously. Unfortunately, almost all of them are bad.:::0:::C-
Love Actually is a Robert Altman film on happy pills.:::1:::3.5/5
Love Actually is to the romantic-comedy genre what a Sherman tank is to sport- utility vehicles.:::0:::2.5/4
A warm, benevolent comedy whose characters gradually become your dear friends.:::1:::3.5/4
It's going to make a lot of holiday romantics feel very, very good; watching it, I felt cozy and charmed myself.:::1:::B
Individually, the tales wouldn't stand up as short stories. Together, they make for sporadically amusing, ultimately wearying viewing.:::0:::2/4
As bright and cheery as a string of Christmas lights.:::1:::B
A bunch of cutesy characters saying cutesy things... that ultimately, well, turn out cutesy and romantic.:::1:::7/10
So overstuffed with good things and wrapped in such a cheerful package that it's hard to resist.:::1:::3/4
Very funny, effortlessly moving, stylishly made, impeccably acted by a mind-bogglingly great cast -- and, yes, wholly satisfying.:::1:::5/5
There are absolutely no surprises in any of the increasingly choppy vignettes.:::0:::2/4
Feel-good schmaltz creeps into every nook and cranny of writer/director Richard Curtis's Love Actually.:::0:::1.5/4
If you're going to have your emotional responses shunted around like a gear stick, it might as well be by someone who writes dialogue as funny as Curtis does.:::1:::None
a set of interwoven tales that charm but never pander:::1:::4/5

Even Curtis's few missteps make relative sense in his otherwise smart and bulging valentine to the world... in an inspired movie with just so much to love, actually.:::1:::4.5/5
I walked into the theater exhausted and pissed off. I left grinning like an imbecile.:::1:::None
Bill Nighy steals the show whenever on the screen with his rock star cynicism, I'm-so-bored demeanor and funny, off-color dialogue:::1:::B
When he isn't overreaching for absurdity, Curtis can write bouncy patter, but each character gets about 60 seconds before the movie jumps deck to the next love-seeker and the next moony pratfall.:::0:::None
As a director, Curtis can't seem to rein in his writer.:::0:::2/4
Winterbottom's period psychological thriller features two scenes of startling violence, but they're far more unpleasant than shocking, light years from the meaningful jolts that enliven the best of his work.:::0:::None
A virtual love letter to the best of "pulp fiction" storytelling and, as such, the film is most assuredly for grown-ups only.:::1:::4.5/5
Represents a rare misfire for the director.:::0:::2/5
Just a couple of unappetizing scenes in an otherwise painfully dull picture with no grasp on the tightening noose against Tom nor the development of the portrait of a seriously disturbed serial killer.:::0:::1.5/4
This Killer lacks punch, dynamism and genuinely seedy atmosphere.:::0:::None
Many with loathe it, but hopefully, just as many will love it.:::1:::9.5/10
Good-looking but not very effective.:::0:::None
Audiences up to their ears in serial killers may enter this film, thinking they already know them all. Winterbottom will prove them wrong.:::1:::None

What [Wes Craven] wound up with was a witless stab-the-teen time-waster that could be his worst film ever. And considering 2005's wretched Cursed, that's pretty bad.:::0:::0/5
Places too much time in the hands of disposable characters - so that it is neither a brainless slasher flick nor an immersive character piece based in a serial massacre.:::0:::2/5
"My Soul to Take" is one of the most banal horror films I've seen in the past few years, which makes it surprising that it comes from the mind of horror master Wes Craven, who gave birth to the legendary horror icon Freddy Krueger.:::0:::2/4
A single-serving package of adrenaline that wears off quickly.:::0:::None
The filmmaker's red herrings prove depressingly incapable of hiding the real fiend's identity.:::0:::C
Everyone in front of and behind the camera look and feel like they're lifting the heaviest, least horrifying ton of bricks invented.:::0:::1.5/5
Is it just possible that Craven fumbled the ball this time and gave us the equivalent of a fairly amateur teen horror flick?:::0:::3/10
full review at Movies for the Masses:::0:::1.5/5
Clunky bird metaphors, blind kids grabbing for dangling ropes, a Horshack-ian best friend with an abusive stepfather, and a story that would be impossible if any of these kids drove a car, sum up most of the more obvious problems with the film.:::0:::None
Confused, poorly executed, sporadic and incredibly messy, but despite its pitfalls, My Soul to Take is an enormously entertaining bad movie.:::0:::5/10
There's some malarkey about each kid having inherited one of the maniac's personalities, though Craven never does much with that except to point the finger of suspicion at junior.:::0:::None
...the film not only marks a low point within Craven's career but also within the horror genre itself.:::0:::0/4
It's talky, schlocky and stalk-y.:::0:::0/4
With either too much or too little happening on screen and a script juggling too many red herrings at once, My Soul to Take feels like Purgatory... in 3D.:::0:::1.0/4.0
The best thing about My Soul to Take is that it may force folks to revisit Wes Craven's past works and finally realize that he's always been nothing more than a hack in the horror field, a Uwe Boll with a better sense of where to place the camera.:::0:::1/4
While there's much to like about the ideas and atmosphere, Craven can't muster much out of his characters or script to form an interesting message.:::0:::1.5/5
My Soul to Take ends up being mere Chucky cheese.:::1:::None
Craven's writing starts out over the top and just keeps climbing ...:::0:::2/5
disappointing in the way it drags out its narrative to little effect, substituting cheap revelations and sometimes incoherent action for anything resembling the kind of innovation and verve that is the hallmark of Craven's best work:::0:::2/4
This utterly mediocre forget-me-now could've been crafted by any faceless serial director at all.:::0:::0/5
A typically ruthless and cynically comic horror thriller from Craven, set in a high school where the caste system is more terrifying than the possibility of a murderous ghost (the bullying leader of the mean girls is nicknamed 'Fang').:::1:::2.5/4
A thrill-free snooze that will certainly rank as one of the least -- if not the least -- effective entries in Craven's nearly 40-year canon of cinematic shockers.:::0:::1.5/5
Hands down the worst horror movie of the year, and certainly the worst of Wes Craven's career.:::0:::0.5/4
Why am I kinda sorta not really recommending, but mildly defending this movie? Well, as noted, I had fun with it. I was entertained.:::0:::3/5
That Craven is earnestly trying to make an on-the-level, snark-free horror flick signals a welcome sea change in his career.:::1:::2.5/4
There are plenty of formulaic boo! moments, yet Craven intelligently treats Bug's otherworldly issues like hormonal growing pains that must be tamed.:::1:::3/5
This film quickly moves to the top of the list of 'Most Purposeless Use of 3D' beating out 'The Last Airbender' and 'Clash of the Titans' with ease.:::0:::1/10
I smiled throughout, charmed by the stories' feel-good rhythms and the sense of something lovely and quixotic lurking just around the corner.:::1:::3.5/4
All these characters and story threads feel sketchy and incomplete, as if Curtis had written four or five dead-end drafts on one theme, then decided to try combining them all.:::0:::2/5
With Love Actually, first-time director Richard Curtis has given adult moviegoers a joyous Holiday treat.:::1:::None
like a compilation 'Best of' hits album targeted at Christmas shoppers:::1:::B-
Park your cynicism and enjoy the year's best ensemble acting.:::1:::A-
By cramming eight different stories into his film, [Curtis] has guaranteed that none of them will get enough time to fully develop.:::0:::None
Thank you Universal for the perfect holiday gift, Love Actually -- one hilarious poem of a picture to the joy of love!:::1:::3.5/4
Depressingly upbeat.:::1:::7/10
Emotionally pulls you in. I cried two-thirds in straight to the end.:::1:::None
Love Actually is emotionally manipulative, but pleasantly so.:::1:::4/5
A roundly entertaining romantic comedy, Love Actually is still nearly as cloying as it is funny.:::1:::None
Curtis imbues his tales of broken hearts and ecstatic adoration with a festive passion and a cheerful optimism that sweeps the viewer up.:::1:::None
At many points it's memorable, affecting and funny. But just as often it's lachrymose and in thrall to a breathtaking sentimentality that provides a cinematic sugar-rush.:::0:::None
[Richard Curtis is] a smart enough filmmaker to play with cliches without ever falling back on them; the overall structure is carefully manipulative and we don't mind at all.:::1:::4/5

Emotionally stunted at times, Never Let Me Go gets lost in its own melancholy and fails to live up to its potential.:::0:::7/10
a beautifully acted and heartbreaking story of young love, but it opens up more thoughts that just from that angle of storytelling:::1:::3.5/5
Melancholy, poignant and chilling:::1:::3/4
I came to this film knowing nothing about it, except that it was based on the highly-acclaimed novel by Kazuo Ishiguru. I had no foreknowledge of its story or premise-and I'm glad...:::1:::None
Melancholy and futility define this subtle future-set drama about three children who grow up knowing that they'll never own themselves or their own bodies.:::1:::4/4
Although [the] film adaptation does indeed fall short of the brilliance of the source material (and will likely distance viewers even more than the book ever did), it manages to convey the novel's most important themes, and most affecting moments.:::1:::4/5
Mark Romanek manages to make that very real(ish) world look and feel totally alien and hermetically sealed, a gray/blue/green/brown tragedy terrarium that both perfectly colorless and incredibly, inescapably sad.:::1:::3.5/5
It's also a film which affirms what is valuable about life. I think this film is a must-see.:::1:::None
Though often moving at a glacial pace, this mood piece -- aptly described as a refined romantic drama with a cerebral sci-fi twist -- rarely stays in the same place for long.:::1:::3/5
We are rewarded with many scenes of poignant beauty and touching performances in the central roles.:::1:::3.5/5
Director Mark Romanek (One Hour Photo) gives the slow-burning adult drama a nostalgic, almost lyrical glow where hope and acceptance override any impulse to rebel or even question.:::1:::3/5
Whilst I was intrigued by certain elements, I left the theatre with a feeling of disappointment. It was like I hadn't seen the whole story.:::0:::B-
As a triangular love story, this doesn't really soar either, despite good performances from a hip young cast, and the end result is that a story that should have been terribly affecting, isn't.:::0:::3/5
Real men will see this and weep, as I did. It is one of the most moving and profound films in a long time.:::1:::4.5/5
It is a downer -- a heavy downer -- there's absolutely no denying that. I recommend it highly, but not if you're looking at something light to cheer you up.:::1:::3/5
Driven by terrific lead performances, this achingly beautiful work challenges audiences emotionally and intellectually.:::1:::None
While it's not exactly uplifting, this touching tale effectively tackles confronting questions for mankind with nothing but grace.:::1:::3.5/5
Never Let Me Go offers an awful, enduring insight into what it must be like to have your entire being dismissed as well.:::1:::4/5
Never Let Me Go is such a curiously muted viewing experience. Everything is there for a three-tissue weepie, but it never quite comes together.:::0:::None
It's a subtle film of nuances, played out as an emotional journey of three people in not a future setting but the reinvented recent past.:::1:::None
A sobering film:::1:::None
Never Let Me Go  is a beautiful and satisfyingly melancholic story of mortality, destiny, love and loss.:::1:::4.5/5
Poderia ser perfeitamente descrito como uma combinacao curiosa entre Vestigios do Dia e o classico 1984.:::1:::4/5
A film that wants to cry, but can't remember how.:::1:::3/5
Director Mark Romanek and cinematographer Adam Kimmel employ a nostalgic and otherworldly visual sensibility to evoke the golden years of innocence and ignorance.:::1:::A
Despite the grinding bleakness, it's a tremendous film.:::1:::None
Romanek deploys an elegant, deceptively simple visual style here which helps keep the subtle performances front and centre. The end result is a low-key sci-fi film that's strange and sad.:::1:::4/5
Daft and dull.:::0:::2/5
Achingly sad at times, with outstanding performances, it avoids tedious dissection of the issues it raises, making for a careful, delicate meditation on the value and fleeting nature of time and human life.:::1:::4/5
The piece comes across as uneventful, devoid of tension and disappointingly superficial in its view of a parallel dystopia.:::0:::2/5
It is a film almost unremittingly hopeless in its cruel finality, packing a crucial emotional punch, ending with a chilling monologue that reminds us of the tale's universality.:::1:::3.5/5
Deeply moving.:::1:::4/5
While the film has powerful individual scenes and the performances of Mulligan and Garfield convey the anguish of their plight, the work as a whole remains curiously uninvolving.:::1:::3/5
I am told by Ishiguro fans that only stone-hearted people fail to weep at the tale's outcome on the page. The film, by its form's nature, puts too much reality before us.:::1:::3/5
Pretty, empty, and immediately forgettable.:::0:::2/5
Understated, ethereal British elegance in its style and cinematography ... churlish and unforgiving in love and life, and one of the most discreetly disturbing films you will see.:::1:::3/5
A compelling film which lingers in the memory after viewing.:::1:::4/5
Pragmatic and bound by grim duty drilled into her and her friends, Mulligan's Kathy is a masterclass in contained sadness and nothing less than remarkable.:::1:::5/5
Why the hell is this film not on the awards shortlists? Were voters THAT turned off when the cast turned up bongoed on Moet on Film 2010? Or did they just need to make sure there was room on the best actress roster for Annette Ruddy Bening?:::1:::4/5
A beautifully realised adaptation of a profoundly affecting novel.:::1:::4/5
The movie may be too understated for its own good ultimately . . .:::1:::None
The pupils' failure to question their fate plays more like lethargy than tragically repressed emotion.:::0:::2/5
Rather than create a haunting nightmarish history from which we may be unable to awake from today, the use of [the] anachronistic trope in 'Never Let Me Go' only de-empathizes the audience from the film's bigger and brighter ideas.:::0:::None
Structurally and emotionally, Never Let Me Go is a mess, a sci-fi love triangle that left me completely cold.:::0:::40/100
Mulligan is brilliant again but this chilly, sci-fi love story gets mired in tedium and frustrates with lots of unanswered questions-probably by design.:::0:::B-
Nothing about this movie is casual. Perhaps the most impeccably-shot film of the year, every quiet word, every move, every unspoken desire leads us, if we so choose, to reflect on our own paths.:::1:::9/10
Revels in a simplicity that appears to be reaching for the profound, though it can't quite make it.:::1:::7/10
This is not the way human beings behave. But, suspending disbelief on this, the rest of the film is very well made and it does allow some important perspectives on thorny moral issues.:::1:::B+
An uneven effort.:::1:::B
Mulligan is the lynchpin of this film; her doe-eyed softness and melancholy smile perfectly encapsulating our heroine.:::1:::4/5
An impeccably told story that failed to break my heart:::1:::3/5
The performances ... are uniformly great and Romanek's direction holds the whole thing together right up until the last act, where it begins to fall apart a bit.:::1:::None
It is a period piece, it is a sci-fi drama, it is a romance. There even is a dash of horror in there. It's an unlikely melange, but it combines for something both refreshingly original and quietly affecting.:::1:::3/4
Occasionally moments of heartbreaking emotionally honesty bring this science fiction clone film to life:::1:::C+
... I suspect for anyone who was not enchanted by the novel, it is a tale that remains unsatisfying and empty ...:::0:::2/4
Hands-down the best film I saw this week. It's also one of the most depressing.:::1:::4.5/5
Can be viewed as a sort of update of the Frankenstein myth, moved to the more clinical and less pious miracles-of-science era of the late 20th century; as in Mary Shelley's novel, the definition of humanity -- the soul, even -- is a primary concern.:::1:::3/4
The film withholds the explicit fear and passion that another kind of treatment might have aimed for, but it works as a cogent, subdued parable of mortality.:::1:::3/5
Based on the Kazuo Ishiguro novel, this haunting drama may be set in a parallel reality, but what it has to say about human hopes and societal ambition is deeply relevant. It's also beautifully directed and acted.:::1:::4/5
Beautifully shot, superbly written and powerfully emotional, this is a haunting, sci-fi tinged drama with terrific performances from both the three leads and the child actors playing their younger selves.:::1:::4/5
Fashioning the book's secrets into thriller-ish twists would have been the absolute worst decision Alex Garland's screenplay might have made, and it's much too smart and controlled for that. Still, it's possible to wish it were a little more radical.:::1:::3/5
It's all so lamely poetic.:::0:::2/5
Like all the best sci-fi, it's about how we live now, rather than the future.:::1:::3/5
Subtle, solemn and strangely ponderous, it's exquisitely mounted but filled with chilling despair.:::0:::5/10
A fairly good movie that had greatness within its grasp.:::1:::2.5/4
Never Let Me Go offers a potent blend of intriguing premise, fine acting and quiet poignancy. Usually this would leave me an emotional wreck. Yet it didn't.:::0:::2.5/4
A sad, beautiful, thought-provoking picture that works on many different levels.:::1:::3.5/4
Never Let Me Go is gorgeous. And depressing. It's exquisitely acted. And depressing. It's romantic, profound and superbly crafted, shot with the self-contained radiance of a snow globe. And it's depressing.:::1:::2.5/4
Oddly cold and detached, as if director Mark Romanek and screenwriter Alex Garland couldn't decide precisely how to interpret Kazuo Ishiguro's popular novel and so they just laid it out flat. And flat it feels.:::0:::C+
Like great science fiction should, it serves as an allegory and inspires some deep thinking about the world we live in now.:::1:::3.5/4
Anyone who saw the Oscar-nominated Mulligan in An Education knows what she can do. If you didn't, you're in for the kind of quietly revelatory acting that portends a brilliant career.:::1:::3.5/4
It's Knightley, with her slow waking to bitterness, who stuns in a secondary role.:::1:::3/5
As a genius work of art, as an experience that will leave some cold and others clamoring for the right level of praise, Never Let Me Go surpasses expectation.:::1:::4.5/5
The movie is 90 minutes of stiff-upper-lip longing followed by 10 minutes of abruptly interesting resolution, then end credits that the film didn't compel me to stick around for.:::0:::C
The world depicted in Mark Romanek's Never Let Me Go is among the more beautiful dystopias in film history.:::1:::B-
Romanek creates a claustrophobic, emotionally complex and potentially profound portrait of humanity reshaped by what has become scientifically possible.:::1:::2.5/4
For all of its hot-button medical-ethical issues, Never Let Me Go avoids sci-fi cliches. Young Izzy Meikle-Small almost steals the whole movie.:::1:::B
Never Let Me Go, director Mark Romanek's introspective adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro's novel, is a work of subtle beauty -- a melancholy meditation on the finality of life and the choices we make as our time shortens.:::1:::3/4
An intriguing and mostly successful combination of science fiction and chamber drama.:::1:::3/5
[C]om[es] at its horrors gently, almost idyllically... This is science fiction of a keen but subtle sort... so gorgeously delicate and lovely a film that it?s almost impossible to convey how (appropriately) horrific it is...:::1:::None
A picture of immense sadness and resignation, but those blue corners create a riveting sit...an exquisite, artful tragedy of a motion picture. A film not to be missed.:::1:::A-
At the risk of accusing the book of same, the whole thing reeks of fear of genre.:::0:::1/4
Takes a scintilla of an interesting premise and blows it, thanks to lackluster storytelling, unimpressive performances and numerous plot holes, including one so humongous that it's quite possibly larger than the movie itself.:::0:::1.5/5
Romanek's cast is up to the task, but Ishiguro's hybrid of science fiction and coming-of-age drama is less than enchanting.:::0:::None
Never Let Me Go is strangely moving and mournful, but I wish more had been made of the beauty these people are relinquishing, if only as a counterweight to all that artful drear.:::1:::B
The momentum drags and the overall experience becomes tiresome, especially when you're more likely to be questioning the whys rather than feeling for the characters' horrible plight. (Parental Review also Available):::0:::None
Never Let Me Go is one of the more original movies you'll see this year, but the lack of emotional heft proves to be deadly. Still, as near misses go, it's the kind of 'mistake' we'd like to see Hollywood make more often.:::1:::3.5/5
Lots and lots of extremely classy tastefulness that leaves the film not just restrained, but practically mummified.:::0:::5/10
It does things right as a character study and maintains the ambiguity that the Michael Bay version needed.:::1:::None
It's the impending emptiness that is buoyed by Carey Mulligan and her sad smile (think Katie Holmes with something more than an attractive face behind it) and the striking, dark photography that posits the entire film as if it were in mourning.:::1:::None
Never Let Me Go settles for the worst of two genres - the dreary arthouse film and the sci-fi feature.:::0:::2/4
The majority of Never Let Me Go focuses on the love triangle, to snoozy effect.:::0:::None
...a handsome, dutiful adaptation, yet like so many reverent movies based on acclaimed books, it's lifeless.:::0:::2/4
As delicate and docile as its doomed doe-eyed clones, Never Let Me Go has a soul -- just not much of a pulse.:::1:::3/5
While it's true that the material does demand restraint, there's too much of it here. But there's a hot, slow-burning fire missing that needs to be present, particularly when the stakes are this high.:::0:::5.8/10
The emotional impact creeps up on the reader only gradually. Then, bam, it hits forcefully, memorably, and, yes, never lets us go.:::1:::3/4
The theme of Ishiguro's novel -- that we all construct delicate fictions to mask the dehumanization of modern life -- proves so elusive onscreen that by the last scene it has to be spelled out in a clumsy, didactic voice-over.:::0:::None
The movie amounts to a prolonged sigh.:::1:::B
Director Mark Romanek ("One Hour Photo") has taken Kazuo Ishiguro's ("Remains of the Day") award-winning novel of the same name, and with great care turns it into a remarkable movie.:::1:::None
Knightley, Garfield and Mulligan are captivating in this film, and Mulligan even surpasses her Oscar-nominated role in "An Education".:::1:::None
Never Let Me Go is easily one of the most hard-hitting, sick, twisted, demented, disturbing, beautiful and emotional films I have seen in a while.:::1:::4/5
A genre-bending, tender, and provocative gem about what it means to be human, a film that should provide plenty of discussion fodder for thoughtful filmgoers.:::1:::3.5/4
I won't soon forget Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth and that's the film's most essential accomplishment. They haunt you.:::1:::None
The fact that the truest horror happens off screen is haunting.:::1:::B+
Movies about banality are, for reasons that are all too clear, often banal themselves.:::0:::6/10
The combination of social anguish and dark chill in Never Let Me Go packs a quietly devastating punch.:::1:::4.5/5
A science-fiction story with virtually no science-fiction elements, it's instead a subdued drama about people trying to figure out the purpose of their lives and come to terms with their limited time -- which, of course, means it's about everyone.:::1:::4/5
I was so crazy about the book that I was skeptical about a movie doing it justice. But it does.:::1:::3.5/4
It may rob the film of drama, but Romanek has erred on the side of quality, crafting a beautifully cast and artfully rendered allegory of lost youth and trampled innocence.:::1:::3.5/4
It should be absolutely devastating. Instead, it only manages politely truthful.:::1:::2.5/4
Never Let Me Go is a touching, thoughtful, sublimely acted prestige drama based on a fantasy premise.:::1:::3.5/4
You couldn't find three better actors on either side of the pond (to say nothing of Beijing or Bollywood), so it's a disappointment to see the talented cast try so hard to breathe emotional life into this sterile movie.:::0:::C
.. Ishiguro's work is actually better suited to Romanek's dreamy visuals than the page.:::1:::B+
Never Let Me Go is sci-fi for the Belle & Sebastian set.:::1:::3.5/4
Never Let Me Go could have been assembled from the Merchant-Ivory kit. It's stale with suppressed anguish.:::0:::2.5/4
The unsettling secret emerges from the bag early on, and then the story doesn't expand on it. Why don't the main characters lash out about their devastating circumstances?:::0:::2.5/5
The film is a success. It works. Greatness eludes it, yes. But greatness eludes almost every film adaptation of a major novel, which we must remember when confronted by a good one.:::1:::3/4
Never Let Me Go would have made a serious error in ramping up contrived melodrama toward some sort of science-fiction showdown. This is a movie about empathy.:::1:::4/4
I felt more connection to, and sympathy for, these characters in their far-fetched situation than I've felt for a lot of "normal" fictional people lately.:::1:::B+
Like a didactic episode of 'The Twilight Zone' told in slow-motion...turn[s] what's essentially pulp material into a artsy, pretentious tearjerker.:::0:::C+
Dreamily photographed, oddly muted...:::0:::2/4
Romanek, a highly respected music video director making his follow-up to One Hour Photo, has crafted a motion picture that is as visually impressive as it is emotionally distant.:::1:::2.5/4
An exemplary case of exceptional storytelling.:::1:::4/5
Undoubtedly a considerable improvement over Kazuo Ishiguro's nigh unreadable novel...:::1:::3/4
The movie is a zombie art picture. And nothing in it takes hold of us emotionally.:::0:::None
Strangely, Romanek often feels disarmed of exactly these vital organs that might have made him a sturdy, sharp renderer of this story. One senses he's too saddened by the tale he is spinning to take a risk on a demanding image.:::0:::C+
Gorgeous and haunting, Never Let Me Go is a thing of dreamy imagery and subtle notions. Powerful performances by its three young leads deserve to be remembered come awards season.:::1:::3.5/5
Romanek does so many difficult things beautifully in this movie, which richly deserves the Oscar consideration it will surely receive.:::1:::None
...a story of familiar human truths, few of them welcome.:::1:::9/10
For its delicate tone, provocative themes, impeccable craftsmanship and superb performances -- by Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley -- Never Let Me Go earned my great admiration.:::1:::None
Romanek does an extraordinary job translating Ishiguro's deliberate, almost excruciating pace onto the big screen: His images haunt us in much the same way the author's words do.:::1:::3.5/5
It unfolds with the beautiful poisoned grace of a viper readying to strike. ... it haunts and hurts in equal measure.:::1:::4.5/5
Meticulously made and never less than interesting. It develops and sustains a specific, eerily effective mood that's hard to describe.:::1:::3/5
The movie is uneven, largely because it's trying something unusual and ambitious. But that unusual ambition also makes it deeply moving.:::1:::B+
consistent and cohesive, if admittedly languid:::1:::3.5/5
Here's a movie you can't get out of your head, a sci-fi horror story with the seductive allure of a classic romance.:::1:::3.5/4
Hamstrung by a serious bummer of a premise that suffocates the production and leaves it too wrapped up in its self-perceived grand, conceptual significance.:::0:::2/4
A mopey period piece love triangle and air-quote sci-fi drama whose doomed love affair never catches fire. If none of these characters can be roused to try to escape their fate, why should an audience care?:::0:::2.5/5
It is a film that the author's fans and lovers of mature, measured storytelling will embrace.:::1:::4.5/5
Science fiction movies don't come much more ponderous than thdays and we all have seen better movies; the 3-D didn't add a thing:::0:::3/10
My Soul to Take lacks quality 3D and the one, standout, never-seen-before scare necessary to get horror fans spreading the word to fellow scary movie buffs.:::0:::2/5
as much a soul-sucking experience as what the characters themselves are experiencing:::0:::2/5
But then maybe it's asking too much to have characters and a story as one dimensional as this to ever appear to have three dimensions. So in this case, the 3D's of Craven's film are: Dumb, Dull, and Deceptive.:::0:::None
Might not be Wes Craven's best film, but it's certainly his worst.:::0:::0/4
What sinks it is Craven's simplistic, ham-fisted writing and inert direction.:::0:::D-
The worst horror movie Wes Craven's made perhaps ever.:::0:::1/4
Yep, this movie is garbage.:::0:::F
"My Soul to Take" is one of the worst films I?ve seen this year and easily the most irritating.:::0:::F
The silly story can be forgiven. Almost no other living director can instill such a sense of gleeful dread in the autumn woods ... or in an ordinary house.:::1:::3/5
Only someone so smart could make a movie this stupid.:::0:::D
A puzzle with no solutions, a tale with a twist that isn't a twist at all.:::0:::1/4
Downright hilarious in places ? though I don?t think that?s intentional, because it?s also dull and cliche-ridden.:::0:::1.5/4
It's good, theoretically at least, to have Craven back. But why come back for this?:::0:::D+
A thoroughly dreary, by-the-numbers exercise.:::0:::1.5/5
All might be good for a flask-to-the-theater laugh, if not for the unconscionable price gouging.:::0:::None
Wes Craven's first new movie in five years is a brainless, joyless, and yes, you might even say, soulless teen slasher.:::0:::D-
It's your money that's at greater stake with this subpar horror entry in barely noticeable 3D.:::0:::None
This dumb, derivative teen slasher movie would be uninspiring coming from any writer-director, let alone one with several genre classics under his belt.:::0:::None
the most awful kind of entertainment exploitation in that everything is set up to abuse the audience, not the characters:::0:::1/5
The picture is directed with such a loose, slack hand that you'd think Craven had never directed a slasher-thriller before: I didn't jump once; I never even felt vaguely scared or creeped out.:::0:::5/10
It's too mild-mannered for those who relish horror pictures and too gory and plotless and chatty for everyone else.:::0:::2/5
Just another Wes Craven kills kids running around in the woods movie.:::0:::2.5/5
Though the movie's about some sort of eternal killer, the real culprit here is Craven, whose attempt to feed on his earlier successes results in a structurally slipshod and distinctly non-frightening pastiche.:::0:::D
From a newcomer, the ineptitude of this film could be understood; from a man like Wes Craven, it feels like a big fat cheat.:::0:::1.5/5
The highlight of the film, in fact, is a freaky bird costume...that actually vomits and defecates upon its audience. It'd be nice to think the director were self-aware enough to recognize the obvious parallel.:::0:::D+
So utterly awful that it should have been renamed 'My Time to Waste.':::0:::1/5
Sad but true, this is one film that will be remembered as no more than a footnote in the grand scheme of Wes Craven's career.:::0:::2/4
The problem with My Soul to Take isn't in its concept, it's in the execution. It's overly complex and nearly impossible to explain with images, which is why the slasher turns into a visual table read in the final act.:::0:::2.5/5
The work of a lunatic using his own feces to outline an uncomfortably abstract tale of ridiculous possession, brought to life through some of the most excruciatingly obvious and colossally stilted dialogue I?ve heard so far this year.:::0:::D-
Easily the worst movie of Craven's career and not even remotely scary or creepy or any of the things you expect from a good horror movie.:::0:::2/10
This is Crowe's movie to carry and he does it with an earthy realism that reminds of the actor he is beneath the persona.:::1:::3/4
The Next Three Days is kind of a throwback to the classic action movies Hollywood put out in the mid-nineties - the 'one man versus the world' era of thrillers, in which lantern-jawed heroes fight to save their family against improbable odds:::1:::3/5
It's the kind of edge of your seat thriller that leaves you in constant suspense of how the situation will resolve.:::1:::3/4
Even with an actor of Crowe's skill, it's hard to believe the mild, thoughtful John would take to the mean streets of Pittsburgh for fake IDs, blast his way into drug houses and such.:::0:::2.5/5
Managing to overcome the contrivances and implausibilities of the storyline, The Next Three Days succeeds through the sheer verisimilitude of the performances and direction.:::1:::4/5
...The most effective scenes employ the Hitchcockian maxim that you can show a couple kissing for as long as you like provided there's a bomb under the bed. Haggis has plenty of bombs and plenty of beds to put them under.:::1:::None
If it didn't feel like the movie took three days to get through, this could have been a pretty good thriller.:::1:::2.5/4
If I actually gave out star ratings or numerical scores, this one would be right on the fine line between pass and fail.:::0:::None
The suspense isn't just dramatic. It's emotional.:::1:::B
This movie is from fancy Oscar-winning director Paul Haggis. In other words, you're supposed to take it all as seriously as he does. You may find that challenging.:::0:::2.5/5
Occasionally preposterous and bogged down by Haggis' usual lack of subtlety, but the film is also captivating and energetic, particularly during the thrilling final act.:::1:::7/10
Haggis somehow pulls off a delicate balancing act -- a gravity-bound fantasy scenario -- showing us John's desperate, dark, human need while playing out made-for-movie scenes.:::1:::7/10
Although no hidden gem, Russell Crowe certainly could've done much worse than filling Mel Gibson's family-man-of-action shoes. And Paul Haggis thankfully shelves his sociology-degree sermonizing for this pure-pulp prison-break thriller.:::1:::3/4
The bulk of The Next Three Days consists of the build-up to the escape plan, which is probably just as well since this is a thriller surprisingly light on thrills.:::0:::C+
Solid performances, beautiful camerawork. It just would've been nice if they'd included some more twists and turns in the otherwise decent script:::1:::3/5
Groans under the weight of director Paul Haggis' determination to transform a potentially gripping thriller into a meaningful 'human drama'...:::0:::2/4
The film lacks a sense of inquiry, whether it's into the psychology of the characters or into the nature of the society that's wrongfully judged this woman.:::0:::None
Perhaps best viewed when it hits DVD, and you can hit the fast-forward button as you see fit.:::0:::2.5/5
There are a few moments which seem a little too neat but on the whole, this is a tense thriller that doesn't always choose the well-trodden path.:::1:::B+
A taut yet hopeful film that brings some credibility into the newest of film debates.:::1:::3.5/5
A good story well told: solid, meticulously crafted, with that similar, slightly old-fashioned feeling you got from watching a film like Salt.:::1:::None
It's an all-consuming task, and Crowe makes this obsessiveness plausible.:::1:::3/5
This is a terrific film with a final reel guaranteed to have you digging your fingers into your armrest.:::1:::3.5/5
A sumptuous study of grief, ineptitude and desperation, and whilst it might run a little long, it's a decidedly brutal and startlingly human film:::1:::None
Crowe misfires again in Hollywood remake.:::0:::2.5/5
While the performances are solid and there are a handful of truly suspenseful moments, this thriller fails to rise above the formula.:::1:::None
It's not your average escape movie, in fact you wouldn't put that label on it,":::1:::None
As the film turns from drama to action thriller, things start to sizzle and there are some genuinely exciting moments:::1:::None
Haggis [has] padded the film out with more action, but every extra minute makes the film an extra bit implausible.:::0:::None
Neither Crowe nor Banks matches the levels of determination and despair that Vincent Lindon and Diane Kruger brought to the same roles in the original film.:::0:::None
[Crowe] gives his best, most sympathetic performance in years in the corking thriller The Next Three Days.:::1:::4/5
Crowe boring, Banks miscast, script awful, me no likey.:::0:::None
Unlike many regular thrillers, there is no comedy or cynicism to counterweight the absurdity, and not much actual excitement either.:::0:::2/5
A long, slow-moving, unthrilling thriller about a teacher who decides to help his wife, unjustly convicted of murder, escape from prison.:::0:::2/5
Occasionally tense middlebrow thriller that lacks both the set pieces needed to really ramp up the tension and the subtlety to make you care much about the characters.:::0:::2.5/5
There will be no surprises if you've seen the original. But other cinema-goers could well be on the edge of their seats as the gripping, if far-fetched, events unfold.:::1:::4/5
Good fun for the last 90 minutes. Take a sandwich for the first 40.:::1:::3/5
Far-fetched yet inescapably engrossing and often seat-squeezingly tense, The Next Three Days is rip-roaring guff.:::1:::4/5
Enlivened by strong performances from Russell Crowe and Elizabeth Banks, though it's not quite as gripping or as emotionally engaging as the original film and loses points for being half an hour longer.:::1:::3/5
In the third act, both Haggis and his actors kick it into high gear, leading to a breathless chase sequence, the outcome of which is unpredictable to the last moments.:::1:::3/5
Haggis skilfully writes and directs, using a sleek visual style while smoothing out the original version's plot holes:::1:::4/5
Hats off to Paul Haggis. He's got to be the first person to do a Hollywood remake of a foreign movie that turns out to be MORE waffly.:::0:::3/5
Okay, but it lacks conviction.:::1:::3/5
Rock solid thrills and spills. Don't get comfy - this is edge-of-the-seat stuff.:::1:::3/5
The Next Three Days is perfunctory fare that seems to last almost as long as its title.:::0:::2/5
A laborious thriller that lacks wit, intelligence, and, most unforgivably, thrills, The Next Three Days continues the steady decline of Crowe's career.:::0:::2/5
Paul Haggis ('In the Valley of Elah') manages to make this American adaptation of Fred Cavaye's 'Pour Elle' an engaging film:::1:::3

full review at Movies for the Masses:::1:::3/5
Haggis struggles to make his presence felt over ludicrous thrills, but Crowe is superb and the entertainment factor high.:::1:::3/5
Russell Crowe delivers another superb, undersung performance in 'The Next Three Days,' a remake of a French thriller in which a husband will stop at nothing to free his wife from imprisonment.:::1:::3/4
The restaurant-set introduction is a little clunky, and it may be a little overlong (with too many supporting characters), but overall Haggis' film is a competent thriller, subtly directed and well acted.:::1:::3/5
I had a lot of fun watching this clever, polished, well-acted caper.:::1:::B
Is The Next Three Days implausible? You betcha. Tell that to the magnetic stars, the smart screenplay and the impassioned direction by Paul Haggis.:::1:::3/4
John needs to move on and leave Lara behind as the Next Three Days felt like three years.:::0:::2/5
too willing to conceded complexities for more reliable Hollywood thrills:::0:::2.5/4
John's not Keyser Soze, but John does have a self-certainty and aptitude for rationalization and moral relativism that make him just a little creepy.:::0:::None
It suffers from a pretty far-fetched premise...but it's is not as heavy-handed or preachy as Crash. Part of that credit goes to Crowe, who is so good he could inject a believable amount of humanity into a floor lamp.:::1:::2.5/4
Audiences may roll an eye here or there, but they're unlikely to lose interest in John's efforts.:::1:::3/4
A lot of illogic can be put aside if the excitement of the thrills is great enough to overcome the carps and if the players earn your unrelieved concern for them and the outcome of their travails.:::1:::3.5/5
The first half is a psychological study and the last half is an action thriller - both halves work.:::1:::6/10
A drama that leads into a thriller.:::1:::3.5/5
There could have been ample room for satire here, but writer-director Paul Haggis wouldn't know a cinematic sense of humor if it rammed his car on the freeway.:::0:::C
The Next Three Days is so successful in its unassuming, violent way that it's tempting to advise Haggis to only adapt other writers' work from now on.:::1:::None
In its final half-hour, all the stops are pulled. The movie is still wildly implausible but at least it's hurtling forward.:::1:::B-
The movie is a caper without playfulness or wit -- it's accomplished but not much fun.:::0:::None
Paul Haggis defies convention and avoids cliche with a smart script that's at once thrilling and romantic.:::1:::None
If the misleading teaser trailers tempt you to watch this preposterous no-brainer, wait patiently for the redbox DVD at a cheap $1 rental fee.:::0:::2/2
John's not Keyser Soze, but John does have a self-certainty and aptitude for rationalization and moral relativism that make him just a little creepy.:::0:::None
Crowe proves he can still play an ordinary man and after a slow burn, this film picks up the pace for an insanely exciting finish.:::1:::9/10
In the end, you get a thriller that's basically about nothing and not that thrilling. This is a product made to place in theaters like a can of Del Monte Sliced Peaches is manufactured for a grocery shelf.:::0:::None
It mostly works, but Haggis is more a director of ideas than instinct, and he's simply not skilled at this kind of pure suspense.:::0:::3/5
The Next Three Days is a popcorn thriller through and through. Unfortunately, it's also painfully boring.:::0:::1.5/5
Haggis knows that the question isn't only can he do it, but should he?:::0:::C+
what should be tension more closely resembles air being let slowly out of a balloon:::0:::1/4
The thriller works better when viewed as a love story.:::0:::C+
It's fun while it lasts, and when it's over, you'll move on to the next three movies.:::1:::3/5
It's really, really stupid but in the best 'so crazy I can't believe it's a movie' way... I'm especially surprised that Crowe and Haggis made this. They're usually so serious but it seems they just went WTF.:::0:::None
Despite prominent pacing problems and an ending that goes on for too long, The Three Next Days works well as a character piece due to the solid performances by the cast.:::1:::7.5/10
It's laughably, eye-rollingly absurd, so you don't watch it and wonder, "Hey, why not?" You endure it and wonder, "So ... why did they do that?":::0:::2/5
It seems impossible that such a naif could pull this off, especially when there's a cop (Jason Beghe) who senses something fishy about him early on.:::0:::2.5/5
An okay thriller with lots of smart flourishes, The Next Three Days has us hooked early on but never quite gets us in the boat:::0:::2.5/4
Faults and all, The Next Three Days is a pleasant surprise this fall -- a thriller that moves us while steering clear of the action cliches.:::1:::B
Not much more than a meticulously detailed, very long instructional video.:::0:::2.5/5
Suspenseful if not wholly believable, the main problem with The Next Three Days is it lasts about a half day too long.:::1:::B-
The characters are so vivid that the suspense never lags.:::1:::None
The last 30 minutes are damnably tense:::1:::3/4
The tension is palpable. Writer/director Paul Haggis twists expected plot solutions in unexpected ways, and the movie is highly entertaining.:::1:::3.5/5
The biggest crime isn't the husband's attempt to steal his wife from jail. It's that with Paul Haggis' remake of the taut French thriller Pour Elle, the story's been robbed of its bite.:::0:::4.5/10
One of the rare remakes that improves upon the original, THE NEXT THREE DAYS is a fun, exciting thriller in the vein of THE FUGITIVE and FRANTIC. Crowe & Banks are phenomenal.:::1:::8/10
...succeeds as both an introspective drama and a high-octane thriller.:::1:::3.5/4
It makes you wonder why the Crash director bothers with shades of gray when his simple-minded movies can really only see in black and white.:::0:::52/100
By the end it is like watching Haggis reconsider choices made along the way and absolving himself for not knowing when a thriller just needs to be a thriller and the metaphors can be left to the real teachers.:::0:::2.5/4
In the end, it's a satisfying thriller with crisp action sequences, once it gets around to that part of Haggis' story-telling agenda.:::1:::None
Paul Haggis gets us so engrossed watching the gears slowly mesh in his prison-break drama The Next Three Days, it's disconcerting when the machine finally clanks noisily into action.:::0:::2.5/4
Alas, Haggis' commitment to bringing out the truth of the premise turns the "The Next Three Days" into a downbeat film.:::0:::2/4
By the way, all of you Liam Neeson fans will want your money back when it turns out he's in one scene.:::0:::1/4
I didn't buy how "The Next Three Days" plays out -- but I almost bought it, and that's good enough for a thriller.:::1:::3/4
It plods along dutifully, with the occasional zigzag into contrivance, tidy coincidence and outright preposterousness.:::0:::2/4
Paul Haggis loses his way in a labored prison escape drama that never recovers from a serious miscalculation midway through and then goes completely off the rails.:::0:::D
Haggis gets us efficiently from one place to the next, it's well-designed and the cast is solid. It's his script -- the ground beneath their feet -- that is shaky.:::0:::1.5/4
It has some interesting things going for it, but it's too long and unfocused, leaving you wondering what attracted director Paul Haggis to this story in the first place.:::0:::2.5/5
Crisply acted, smartly directed and patently absurd, The Next Three Days is a high-tension thriller wound so tight it seems ready to snap like a stressed guitar string at any minute.:::0:::C+
Haggis has a case of tunnel-vision in The Next Three Days, a sense that nothing extraneously lofty will get in the way.:::1:::3/4
A bomb in no uncertain terms, an ill-formed, stupidly plotted, morally unclean thriller.:::0:::1.5/4
Another prison drama, Paul Haggis' blandly titled "The Next Three Days' is a remake of a far-fetched recent French hit and a movie only the gullible, or the French, could swallow.:::0:::C+
It swings between being a whodunit and a guns-blazing romp. By film's end, you may not be sure what it is, either.:::0:::2/4
Haggis seems obsessed with making sure we "get it" in every scene. You can almost feel the hammer poised right above your head to pound the point home. Beyond that, the film is too long on exposition in some places, too short in others, never just right.:::0:::1/5
Haggis manages to ... deliver a moving, exciting film that also just so happens to be a veritable how-to guide for breaking out of prison.:::1:::4 stars out of 5
The Next Three Days wants to be clever. It wants to be taut and suspenseful, tricky and exciting. To be fair, the movie manages to conjure small moments of all those things. But by the end, it's succeeded at none of them.:::1:::2/5
It's fun to watch the methodical way this novice plans and executes his daring scheme ... fun enough that most of us will put our reservations on hold.:::1:::2.5/4
Haggis lets a tantalizing sliver of doubt toward Lara's innocence linger, leaving open the possibility that John is a love-struck fool rather than an avatar of faithful spousehood. And then it gets dumb.:::0:::C+
The Next Three Days offers enough suspense to make it worth the price of admission.:::1:::3/4
Mr. Haggis deserves props for shattering the myth that all Prius drivers are good. But his movie wears you down while it's whipping you up.:::0:::None
It's a cool, engrossing thriller; intelligent, packed with shivering suspense, populated with marvelous characters and (unless you've seen the French original, "Pour Elle") impressively unpredictable.:::1:::3.5/4
One thing's for certain: "The Next Three Days" was not made because somebody involved had a story to tell.:::0:::1.5/4
Crowe and Banks actually make "The Next Three Days" work better than it deserves to; its pacing is off, and things don't really get moving until the final, electric half-hour or so.:::0:::2.5/4
The Next Three Days is genre fare -- no pretensions, no nonsense.:::1:::3/4
One of the best movies of the year.:::1:::4.5/5
A name filmmaker and star trying with all their might to pump a slender genre flick into an Oscar-caliber action-drama -- and failing.:::0:::2/4
It's quite a suspenseful ride and Elizabeth Banks gives a passionately ambiguous performance...:::1:::B
Meandering and a little silly:::0:::2.5/5
Ultimately, the film sinks due to pacing issues, some truly manipulative storytelling and a whole bunch of glaring plot holes:::0:::2/5
While it's a relief to see Haggis not preaching about, say, the evils of racism, he doesn't wholly embrace the genre assignment, which leaves him perpetually a beat or two behind.:::0:::C+
It's hard for Haggis to make the jump to thriller hyperspace after the stodgy opening acts. And when it does go jailbreak on us, it does so unconvincingly.:::0:::C
The plot is worked out with care, and it takes its time, unapologetically, in a manner that's perfectly suited to thinking adults. The whole enterprise reeks of class.:::1:::7.5/10
It's damn hard to enjoy a thriller when you don't, won't, can't believe a word of it.:::0:::1.5/4
Everything hinges on Crowe, who delivers his most appealing performance in years.:::1:::3.5/5
Despite Crowe's indisputable ability to transform himself and dig deep for every character he plays, we never get a sense of whether crafting this plot weighs on John's conscience.:::0:::None
[I]t should be ridiculous... But Russell Crowe makes it work in ways that far exceed any expectations we should honestly have for such a preposterous potboiler of a concept.:::1:::None
...watching Haggis simply work the pulses, guts and adrenal glands of the audience is decidedly more pleasant than having him clamber into our laps to appeal to our hearts, minds and souls.:::1:::3/5
Comes across as borderline absurd...really needs to be tauter in order to paper over the plot holes and logical lapses.:::0:::C
Terrific performances plus clever and suspenseful twists you never see coming.:::1:::4/5
Ambiguous, heavy-handed morality tale with a pretentious plot that's implausible.:::0:::6/10
As a writer, Haggis hasn't met a roadblock he can resist, which puts him at odds with a directorial side that's perfectly capable of cranking out a serviceable chase picture.:::1:::None
Thrillers don't need to be 100 percent believable, but staying above 10 percent usually helps.:::0:::2/5
Consistently entertaining, the picture nevertheless has a nasty habit of wandering aimlessly, disrupting the visceral extravaganza at hand.:::1:::B-
This remake of the 2008 French thriller Pour Elle is a half-hour longer, less suspenseful and hobbled by a slacker pace.:::1:::2.5/4
The movie is a competent thriller, but maybe could have been more.:::0:::2.5/4
Takes what should be a rousing thriller and turns it into a plodding bore.:::0:::2/5
Redeeming itself with its zippy climax, "The Next Three Days" finally works by avoiding self-importance...Haggis has made the most watchable movie of his career. That's not saying much, but it's still saying something.:::1:::None
An implausible exercise in contrivance and bogus irony. A well-acted one, however...:::0:::2.5/4
Middlebrow sensibility and heavyhanded touch define Paul Haggis version of the far superior French thriller, and his lack of technical skills in staging action sequences makes the film even weaker.:::0:::C
The movie's real strength ... is generating escalating waves of plot tension and misdirection as John, heeding advice, makes his jaie beautifully filmed Never Let Me Go, which reduces the debate over genetic engineering to a mild, moist romantic soap opera.:::0:::2/4
Romanek has a genuine, acquired understanding of pop's prevarications. He means to avoid triviality and bring emotional and visual gravity to the experience of youth, yet doesn't seem to grasp that Ishiguro's concept is daft.:::0:::None
It's a very tony fantasy of class oppression and fascist medical exploitation (themes that may speak louder in England), but it's a lyrically inert movie.:::0:::C+
Philosophically provocative and achingly sad, Never Let Me Go manages to touch the mind and the heart at once, and with equal measure.:::1:::None
The film's conceit begins to crumble under the weight of unpersuasive details.:::0:::C+
Depressing, but beautifully crafted.:::1:::7/10
If there was a way to make this romantic mystery as stirring on screen as it was on the page [Mark] Romanek hasn't found it. But his film works in a modest way.:::1:::3.5/5
Everything is in its place, including the overly tidied-up meaning.:::0:::2.5/5
Ishiguro's book was an unconvincing blend of repressed romance and speculative fiction, with superficial too-polite prose and a clunky approach to narrative secrecy that wouldn't fool the gang on Scooby-Doo.:::0:::2/5
This is a moving and provocative film that initially unsettles, then disturbs and finally haunts you well into the night.:::1:::4.5/5
Never Let Me Go would drift from memory if it weren't for Mulligan's face of loss, hope, and aggrieved empathy -- a look that's hard to let go.:::0:::6.5/10
While the movie doesn't stoop to synopsizing its source material, we need some explanation why these kids aren't in a car and on the lam.:::0:::2/4
Pervaded by a cosmic wistfulness, the movie Never Let Me Go is melancholy where the novel is haunting.:::1:::None
Never Let Me Go is a horror movie of a sort, but the horrors are not the kind that come leaping wetly off the screen; instead, they build up in your mind like a toxic silt.:::1:::None
Part of the joy of viewing the film 'Never Let Me Go' or engrossing yourself within the pages of Kazuo Ishiguro's acclaimed book on which it's based, is slowly perceiving the dystopian nature of the tale.:::1:::None
This is a hard movie to shake. That's a good thing, by the way. Not as devastating as Kazuo Ishiguro's astounding novel, this heart achingly beautiful film still resonates.:::1:::None
Some people may appreciate its original take on a not particularly original premise ... others are likely to find it too tedious and depressing to put much thought into what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish.:::0:::6/10
A more admirable movie than a lovable one, but director Mark Romanek has so faithfully adapted Ishiguro's novel with such grace that it's moving in its own quiet way.:::1:::3.5/5
Director Mark Romanek creates a quiet, leisurely pace that would not be out of place in a yoga class.:::0:::None
If you don't completely scoff at Romanek's vision, it's because its ambivalence isn't exactly far from Ishiguro's own stiff upper lip.:::0:::2/4
The movie works beautifully even if you know what's coming and knowing it makes the film's strangely beautiful early scenes even more poignant.:::1:::3.5/4
If you're overly nervous about knowing anything about the movie, then just know that I recommend the film with one caveat: this movie will not hold your hand. Whatever reactions you have to it will be earned, not spoon-fed.:::1:::None
Haunting, heartbreaking adaptation of the Ishiguro novel features a superb cast and inspired direction and cinematography...and a unique comingling of genres.:::1:::None
Lugubrious study of the perils of genetic engineering.:::0:::None

At a recent screening, I was amused by the audience laughing at several moments on screen that didn't seem intended as comic relief. I'm guessing they were desperate for something to enjoy.:::0:::C-
The story started off as France's Anything for Her, itself an absurd effort. But it's been given a special patina of self-seriousness by Crash's Paul Haggis, who adapted the script and directs.:::0:::2/5
A well-acted but conventional jailbreak story.:::1:::B-
Like his lumpy protagonist, Haggis... too confidently assumes viewers are as quick to abandon sense and logic.:::0:::None
Russell Crowe's the whole show in a thriller about a professor who needs to breaks his wife out of jail.:::0:::None
A high-octane thriller that plunges you headlong on a thrill-a-minute roller coaster ride where a desperate man's conscience is your only guide.:::1:::4/4
Writer/director Paul "In the Valley of Elah" Haggis's prison break drama is so full of plot holes that it defies all suspension of disbelief.:::0:::C-
A compelling thriller directed by Paul Haggis on the ethical decision of a husband to break the law in order to right an injustice to his wife.:::1:::3/5
Unlike Conviction, this film opts out of DNA/exoneration heartbreak as a triumphant dramatic tool, and goes directly for the post-9/11 paranoia, righteously rebellious jugular instead. So is one man's terrorist another man's Russell Crowe? You bet.:::1:::None
To get anything out of this overlong, underwhelming nonsense, think of it as a blow against the wimpification of the American male.:::0:::2.5/5
The Next Three Days refuses to puff up its action with message-movie sermonizing.:::1:::2.5/4
Haggis stages an emotional, tense ride.:::1:::None
What was briskly diverting in the original has been rather laboriously overworked, and the film's attempt to draw out the moral stakes never addresses the material's basic, surface-level implausibility.:::0:::None
Although involving, this remake of a recent French film never reaches the anticipated heights of excitement and suspense.:::0:::None
Two acts of muddled character study and a final act that's a taut, extended cat-and-mouse chase: This is what awaits viewers in The Next Three Days.:::0:::None

An uncomfortable journey for everyone involved.:::0:::None
Though mixing espionage and family values in unraveling dysfunctional behavior among a bratty brood of siblings may be a stretch, Jackie Chan makes the most of it in his latest caper targeting unruly kids.:::1:::None
This is the broad, silly kiddie exercise it appears to be.:::0:::2/4
Lame.:::0:::2/4
If you're still awake by the end credits, Chan's out-takes are sadly the funniest thing in this inane, silly and below-par effort. This one is for kids only.:::0:::3/5
The woeful screenplay, the mundane direction, by Brian Levant, and the indifferent acting all combine to sink a stupid plot which should never have got off the ground.:::0:::0.5/5
[The movie] is [likable], bringing a peppy energy to Bob's segue from international spy to babysitter.:::1:::None
The slapstick comedy will amuse a young audience, but their parents will find it tedious.:::0:::None
Definitely one for the kids to watch on their own when it comes out on DVD.:::0:::None

Tongue-in-cheek entertainment...:::1:::3/5
[It] may be a sign that age has finally caught up with this once most agile of action heroes.:::0:::2/4
A movie that posits Billy Ray Cyrus as a techno-genius and allows the baddies to get away with Russian accents that would put most meerkats to shame.:::0:::2/5
It starts slowly and ends very predictably. In fact, the bloopers which come before the end credits are probably the best thing about it -- and that says a lot.:::0:::None
The results are always less than hilarious.:::0:::2/5
Only Chan's charm saves it.:::0:::1/5
The closing credit outtakes are the best part of this feeble effort.:::0:::2/5
When people moan about the world's worst film-makers, the names Uwe Boll and Joel Schumacher invariably come up. If Brian Levant has escaped such infamy, it's only by sticking under the radar with kiddie-litter.:::0:::1/5
This is hewn straight from the same, rickety old domestic-crisis formula which was never funny the first time round.:::0:::2/5
Even the outtakes barely raise a smile.:::0:::1/5
When even the out-take bloopers over the final credits are weak, you know you've got a pretty under-par Jackie Chan movie on your hands.:::0:::2/5
Jackie Chan always guarantees a good time with his friendly manner combined with intricate fight stunts inventively choreographed and smoothly executed and this is no exception:::1:::None
Filled with hilarious set ups, impossibly executed stunts plus an engaging central story about family and being loved, this funny action comedy is great entertainment for the whole family:::1:::None
It's low on laughs and is almost undone by an irritating child performance from Will Shadley.:::0:::2/5
Just normal, common- or-garden, ready-salted bad.:::0:::2/5
Filled with slapstick guffaws, dodgy accents and copious pratfalls, Brian Levant's light-hearted action comedy succeeds because it stays true to what it actually is: a kids' movie.:::1:::3/5
You have been warned.:::0:::2/5
Chan is still likeable ... but he's on his own.:::0:::2/5
Not as good as it should be but not as bad as I thought it would be, "The Spy Next Door" is an average actioner geared toward kids.:::0:::2/4
The Spy Next Door is inane, but Jackie Chan manages to make it bearable.:::0:::2.5/5
Chan's action moves are becoming a little rehearsed looking but the man still has charm:::0:::5/10
When Jackie Chan gave up on acting and decided to retire, he didn't issue a press release, he made The Spy Next Door.:::0:::D+
The movie is, understandably, an incompetence pile.:::0:::1/5

This is not one of Jackie Chan's best films, but it's still fun to watch Chan pull out all the stops to entertain us at an age when many actors have stopped trying.:::1:::None
The Spy Next Door is bland, unassuming stuff for the kiddies. But few family films have Jackie Chan at their disposal.:::0:::2/4

At some point, the social mores that functionally banned most other forms of ethnic stereotyping will catch up with the Slavs, a sad day indeed for middling screenwriters.:::0:::1.5/4
Jackie Chan family flick high on stunts but low on laughs.:::0:::2/5
Chan's comedic gifts and still-nimble moves are wasted in a string of unimaginative household calamities and practical jokes.:::0:::1/4
As for Mr. Chan, he has some passably choreographed bits with folding chairs, a bicycle and, later, some pots and pans at Gillian's house. But it's hardly enough to redeem -- or even make bearable -- this half-hearted hodgepodge.:::0:::1/5
It seemed as if all of the actors were reading their dialogue from a cue card. The Spy Next Door is already one of the worst films of 2010. Horrible.:::0:::0.5/5
One wonders what sins Jackie Chan could have committed in a single lifetime to warrant having an abomination like this pathetic excuse for a movie weighing down his karma.:::0:::None
Still fit and doing quite a few of his own stunts, Chan is an action hero with considerable charm.:::0:::2/4
The script -- which took three people to write -- is barely coherent, and it's unclear whether Brian Levant was even on set when he directed. All that's left for us to enjoy are the action scenes, and frankly most of those are a little depressing.:::0:::1/5
Chan is actually a fairly likeable hero and his elocution, never great, is at least passable in this latest romp.:::0:::2/4
Duller than a Monday night at the cobweb museum...:::0:::1/4

The Spy Next Door is so hokey that I couldn't help but wonder if I was watching a campy sendup. It opens with "Secret Agent Man," for god's sake!:::0:::None

[It] will win no prizes for originality, but it benefits greatly from the subtle performances of the two leads, particularly Leo...:::1:::3/5
It's a preposterous story, yet for part of its duration at least, Gandolfini as the slouching, baggily dressed Doug and Leo as the reawakened wife manage to make it rather touching.:::1:::None
If it could be too slow-burning for some, it is at least a refreshing change from a pattern of film-making that never gives you a moment's rest because there is nothing under the surface.:::1:::3/5
It's downbeat and has little to say about the grieving process, and while Gandolfini and Leo are memorable, Stewart is not.:::0:::2/5
Gandolfini's bashful, bear-like Doug is endearing but most of this earnest film just doesn't ring true.:::0:::2/5
It's a well-made film, and New Orleans is crisply and interestingly shot by cinematographer Christopher Soos, but this ultimately looks like a TV movie dressed up for the big screen.:::0:::2/5
Despite its indie sensibilities, under the surface it's a pure Hollywood heart that beats here.:::1:::3/5
Stewart's strung-out, frowzy performance is a timely reminder that the girl can act, but despite strong work from all three leads, the facile screenplay runs out of things to say fairly quickly.:::0:::2/5
The dialogue and ponderous drama got lost even before the camera rolled.:::0:::2/5
Observant writing and direction make this exploration of grief surprisingly uplifting.:::1:::3.5/5
Quietly assured and superbly written, this is an emotionally engaging drama with a trio of terrific performances from James Gandolfini, Kristen Stewart and Melissa Leo.:::1:::3/5
Movingly written and exquisitely played by the three leads, this never gets bogged down in sentiment or lazily opts for easy answers.:::1:::3/5
Stewart lets it all hang out in a firecracker role but her damaged character never achieves the depth the weak material could have done with.:::0:::2/5
It's not horrible. It's just directed and written with a heavy hand and a sensibility that could use a lot more restraint.:::0:::2.5/5
...a consistently watchable piece of work that benefits substantially from its stellar performances...:::1:::3/4
Surprising twists lead the story in unexpected directions. The actors get credit for making you care about these characters. The audience develops a temporary bond during the 110-minute running time.:::1:::3/4
The film works because its stars make up a trifecta of terrific performers who overcome the cliches inherent in their characters.:::1:::3/4
...an uncompromising movie about the compromises people sometimes have to make in order to save themselves - and others. It's about doing what's necessary and right, instead of what's moral.:::1:::88/100
"Welcome to the Rileys" sets out to be a study of grief and how to overcome it, but it rings too false to offer much hope - or entertainment.:::0:::2/4

It's as if Tony Soprano and Bella Swan had landed the two leads in somebody's amateur theater company, and this is what the lucky audience gets.:::0:::2/4
The performances find the ideal tone of closure, leaving the future relationship between these three more intriguing than anything established in the film.:::0:::C
The story sounds ridiculous -- hokey, even. But James Gandolfini, Melissa Leo and Kristen Stewart inhabit their roles with such an unstudied validity that we don't for a moment think of them as movie characters behaving for the camera.:::1:::3.5/4
"Welcome to the Rileys"? Thanks, but no thanks.:::0:::0.5/4
Welcome to the Rileys is a reminder that good, or at least intriguing, things can come in what seem to be predictable packages.:::1:::3/5
Tries to turn an inherently melodramatic tale into a serious study of middle-class grief, but doesn't succeed despite the acting talent on hand.:::0:::C+
Produced under the Scott Free banner (Ridley and Tony Scott, producers), it's surprising that such Hollywood heavyweights would choose a script that's so woefully bare.:::0:::4/10
It's surprising in the lovely notes it consistently hits, and the simmering sweetness it achieves, despite the dark, seedy framework propping it up:::1:::3/4
The welcome mat on this film is very soggy indeed.:::0:::2/5
Terrific acting by James Gandolfini and Melissa Leo -- and a noble effort from Kristen Stewart -- goes a long way toward salvaging it.:::1:::3.5/5
Gandolfini is admirably low key, but Stewart seems stuck in the same sneering, pouty mode she's practically trademarked.:::0:::C+
Doug's mission -- to reclaim Mallory's innocence and his own fatherhood -- is too deranged for the squeaky-clean treatment it receives here.:::0:::C
A character-driven drama that too often and bores you with its sluggish pace and poor editing. James Gandolfini and Melissa Leo anchor the film in raw, well-nuanced performances.:::0:::5.01/10
What makes "Welcome to the Rileys" watchable is the cast. You won't find much Tony Soprano DNA in Gandolfini's somewhat slimmer Doug, outside of the powerful paternal instinct.:::1:::B-
The performances all around are great... [but] this is yet another wearyingly familiar story about what women can and should do for men, not about the woman themselves.:::1:::None
A couple finds a way out of mourning in wrenching drama.:::1:::3/5
These are complex, believable characters, wholly deglamorized and bestowed with the layered complications that define real life.:::1:::3.5/4
Stewart gives the kind of raw performance those of us who'd practically fallen asleep during her comatose Twilight line readings forgot she was capable of.:::1:::B+
The kind of movie performers often hail as a "labor of love." And audiences just find labored.:::0:::2/4
If Welcome to the Rileys were a thicker-skinned movie -- if it were the movie it thinks it is -- so much of the outcome wouldn't be telegraphed the minute you read the premise.:::0:::2/5
Ms. Leo finds a way to be affecting in spite of it all. It's as if her later scenes had been lifted from another movie. An enjoyable one.:::0:::None
Audiences tend to avoid Kristen Stewart's non-Twilight movies like vampires fleeing daylight. Believe me, it's their loss.:::1:::3/4
The film wears its heart on its sleeve, but the drama falters when the tone grows over-earnest.:::1:::3/5
Sorrow suffuses "Welcome to the Rileys," if somewhat uneasily.:::1:::3/5
Gandolfini, Leo and Stewart are well and able to carry this story pretty far, and it truly is a success for that reason:::1:::3/5
Stewart's idea of inhabiting this part seems to be to scowl a lot and let her hair go unwashed. The Twilight star doesn't have the depth or emotional agility to go toe-to-toe with Gandolfini and Leo.:::0:::2.5/4
The actors and admirably sensitive director Jake Scott (son of Ridley) can't compensate for Ken Hixon's long slog of a script.:::0:::2/4
Like a quiet conversation about despair and hope.:::1:::3/5
Sensitive performances by James Gandolfini and Melissa Leo--and a sensationally sleazy one by Kristen Stewart--are simply not enough to enliven this downer of a movie about profound grief and how it makes people behave in strange ways--very strange ways.:::0:::None
The story line invites such horselaughs that writer Ken Hixon and director Jake Scott handle it too gingerly, as if at the end of tongs.:::0:::2/4
Scott has the good sense not to bring everything to a neat conclusion. After all, this is really the Rileys' movie, and one about rebirth and letting go of demons.:::1:::None
This is a movie where the drama is shaped more by quiet conversations e Spy Next Door follows Brian Levant's long track record of pandering, PG-rated family comedies that look like bad TV (and sometimes are adapted from it)...:::0:::C-
In all, The Spy Next Door won't be regarded as anything but a minor effort in Chan's stateside repertoire, though its better moments should go a long way toward winning the ageless Chan a new audience of adoring youngsters.:::0:::2/5
The fight sequences (with obvious doubles) are anemic, and Chan's traditional outtakes over the closing credits wear pitifully thin.:::0:::None
Same old Chan routine of 1-2-3 staging, only tweaked here with a distinct Hanna-Barbera tone that keeps Door safe for children, but less invigorating for Chan purists or, and God bless 'em, parents forced to accompany their kids to this thing.:::0:::D
Undemanding action farce aimed squarely at the PG crowd.:::0:::None
A kid's film that's distressingly short on both wit and action. Obviously, Jackie Chan isn't immune to making one for the paycheck and phoning in his performance.:::0:::None
Chan's new all-ages vehicle is smooth like oatmeal. It's hard to imagine anyone being offended, except fans of good comedy.:::0:::1.5/4
This corny action comedy isn't just lame on the Jackie Chan scale. It's lame on the George Lopez scale. That's bad.:::0:::1/5
The Spy Next Door is precisely what you would expect from a PG-rated Jackie Chan comedy with that plot. If that's what you're looking for, you won't be disappointed. It's not what I was looking for.:::0:::1.5/4
It's pitched at a pre-teen audience -- the only kind likely to enjoy Levant's cheap misfire.:::0:::0.5/4
This sad little movie is built entirely to set up Chan's stunt sequences as he fights with pots, pans, ladders and other found objects or hurtles stairways to chase bad guys. The action stuff is more tolerable than the jokes, but barely.:::0:::None
As matinee fodder for desperate families, it could be worse. But not much.:::0:::D

The characters (through no fault of the young performers) have all the personality of hand puppets.:::0:::2/5
Conveys, in a good-humoured, sharply observed way, the small, painful cruelties and unpredictable rules of early adolescence, and it celebrates awkwardness without feeling the need to convert it into cheap triumph.:::1:::3/5
The film retains much of the original humour, some of it well executed. It's reasonably faithful to the spirit of the books, probably because Kinney is the executive producer, but it's by no means equal to his originals.:::1:::3/5
Perceptive, funny, unusually edgy voyage into the comic travails of schoolyard politics and childhood friendship.:::1:::4/5
Performances from the young cast are arguably a little too slick and knowing for the naive characters they are playing, but that is often par for the course in American films these days.:::0:::2.5/5

Middle-school antihero Greg Heffley may depict himself as a comic illustration in Jeff Kinney's bestselling kids' books, but director Thor Freudenthal turns him into an outright caricature.:::0:::1/4
Largely avoids the gimmicky saccharine aftertaste that's typical of the genre. Anyone older than the story's resident Job, however, may not find much to write home about.:::0:::2/5
Though not particularly groundbreaking or memorable, "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" definitely exceeds the standards for a modern family film and it's almost guaranteed to entertain any kid who goes to see it.:::1:::B
The true measure of Freudenthal's film is that it's the rare kid's flick that their parents won't have to merely tolerate. Rather, they will enjoy it, too.:::1:::3/4

The film encourages urine, fart, and booger humor, which reeks of nosepicker pandering, compounded by a message of personal worth that never comes through clearly enough.:::0:::C
The friendship message that comes wrapped in the world of Wimpy Kid gives the movie its centre and its heart, along with a reminder that there is no greater act of devotion than a kid who will submit himself to the cheese touch for a pal.:::1:::3/4

Diary of a Wimpy Kid is no Welcome to the Dollhouse, but as a PG-rated family film navigating the frequent pitfalls and rare triumphs of a sixth grade nothing, it's got a certain charm and wisdom about it.:::1:::2.5/4
There's something silly-sweet about this movie. It avoids talking down to kids or being didactic, while still projecting an overall wholesomeness.:::1:::2.5/4
The writing is funny during individual moments, but the cumulative result is a bit depressing, with a surprising amount of negativity. If anything, the pervasive doomed feeling of junior high is too accurate. Who wants to pay money to relive that?:::0:::2/4
The thing in this film that feels most alive is a slice of cheese rotting on a playground blacktop -- which would be a funny joke if it was intentional.:::0:::C+

Diary of a Wimpy Kid, based on the popular illustrated tween books by Jeff Kinney, deserves a B- for effort and a C for execution.:::0:::2.5/4
It's asking a lot for a child actor like Gordon to do the man's portion of this job - to somehow make Heffley's selfishness and failure seem funny. Unfortunately, Seth Rogen is probably a little old for this role.:::1:::B-

To put it in rock 'n' roll terms, you'd go to the gig but you wouldn't buy the t-shirt.:::1:::3/5
For the music lovers: If Superbad, Knocked Up and Forgetting Sarah Marshall are Radiohead's The Bends, OK Computer and Kid A, Get Him To The Greek is their Amnesiac.:::1:::4/5
Quite sadly Get Him to the Greek just doesn't work in the way it was meant to. Despite an ambitious metaphor, the film is far too mean-spirited to tickle our funny-bone.:::0:::6/10
Nesavrena, ali sasvim probavljiva holivudska zabava za ove vru&#263;e ljetne dane:::1:::5/10
Sorry guys, not even a good try:::0:::None
This Forgetting Sarah Marshall spin-off is lively and silly enough to keep us giggling. But its darker moments make the tone rather uneven.:::1:::3.5/5
Prepare to have a bawdy, taboobusting good time. Just don't expect it to resonate anywhere except your funnybone.:::1:::3/5
I'm having a hard time remembering what the really funny bits in Get Him to the Greek were, exactly. I mean, I know I laughed. I just don't really remember why.:::1:::7/10
Get Him To The Greek promises a fun time but rarely delivers the goods.:::0:::2/5
'Greek' works best during the cleverly scored mayhem montage scenes (a highlight involves absinthe and a French version of Happy Together).:::1:::3/5
While it's clear that rock-star petulance and vanity are being spoofed, there is little at stake dramatically or morally -- the bedroom threesome towards the end is weird rather than funny.:::0:::2/5
The basic tonal problem is established right at the outset: we are being invited to laugh at exotic limey Aldous, whereas Brand's stand-up persona needs us to laugh with him and to see the world through his eyes.:::0:::2/5
Needs more Kristen Bell.:::0:::2/5
Just a succession of gross-out gags and sketches that fail to deliver.:::0:::2/5
This is mostly plain hilarious.:::1:::4/5
This is Brand's film, and every aspect of his persona is played to the max - the sexual magnetism, the multiple addictions, the doting but distant mum, the hangers-on and women who want to control him.:::1:::3/5
You can have too much of a good thing and we have our fill of Aldous's sexist outbursts well before the end of the first hour.:::0:::None
While Brand can take credit for the authenticity of his character, Stoller has brought out the best Brand performance to date.:::1:::3/5
Given that Judd Apatow is a co-producer, you'd at least expect the film to make you laugh. The humour's all over the place, though.:::0:::2/4
Unlike many of 2010's comedies so far, hilarity does indeed ensue.:::1:::4/5
This is Brand's movie all the way: he's the one snorting the drugs, throwing the tantrums and getting the lion's share of the laughs.:::1:::4/5
Feeling like a very laboured version of The Hangover, Get Him To The Greek is a bitter pill to swallow in comparison.:::0:::1/5
It's as silly and juvenile as you'd expect, but a whole lot of fun.:::1:::3/5
This is Brand's bag: a man intoxicated with himself, who'll never shut up or stop messing around with east London slang and 19th-century swear words until the world drops its knickers.:::1:::3/5
Aaron and Aldous are a flat-out pleasure to watch bouncing off each other - their chemistry is much richer than the one-note geek/freak odd couple you might expect.:::1:::4/5
The comedy is close to the knuckle at times, but Hill and Brand counter that with an easy chemistry, while those who normally find Brand too loud or abrasive may be surprised to see his softer side.:::1:::4/5
Boasting an impressive above-the-title debut for Brand, this is one for your movie-watchy booky wook.:::1:::4/5
Highly amusing ... confirms Russell Brand as a genuine Hollywood star.:::1:::4/5
Empty laughs are still laughs.:::1:::3/5
A chaotic and turbo-charged ride with laughs and groans and despite its crass downmarket humour, the film has an inventive script that keeps us guessing as we scream together down the corridors of excess:::1:::None
Some will love it, some will hate it and the rest will fall somewhere in between.:::1:::B
Get Him To The Greek is not a masterpiece, but it's very entertaining for audiences who like their comedy raw.:::1:::None
Like most of the recent exports from Apatown, this is patchy, but home-run hilarious from time to time. If only it didn't detour into darkness so often.:::1:::4/5
Boldly enlivened by its risque, full-force approach to drugs and sex, Get Him To The Greek is comedy gold, but it's the film's serious centre (principally its commentary on addiction and relationships) that makes it even more memorable.:::1:::None
It must try all manner of bizarre/obscene/silly things to sustain itself beyond stating the obvious about celebrity excess.:::0:::2/5
Episodes of high hilarity make the movie worth the trip.:::1:::2.5/4
Greek surprisingly poignant.:::1:::3.0/4.0
Russell Brand channels Peter O'Toole in the year's best (so far) alkie celeb yarn:::1:::B-
Get Him to the Greek provides a nice blend of laughs and unexpected moments of real warmth:::1:::2.5/4
...Get Him to the Greek ultimately overstays its welcome in a manner that's nothing short of breathtaking...:::0:::1.5/4
W.C. Fields warned, "Never work with children or animals." Russell Brand and Jonah Hill can add, "Never work with P. Diddy.":::0:::C-
Just funny:::1:::None
Combs, the only breath of fresh air in the film, is the only guy in the whole movie who is in on the joke.:::1:::C+
While there are plenty of laughs to be had in this supremely entertaining -- and surprisingly affecting -- comedy, it is Russell Brand's pitch-perfect performance that makes Get Him to the Greek such a memorable, and joyfully insane ride.:::1:::4/5
Brand can seem simultaneously randy and strung-out and is often very funny. Hill is surprisingly touching, which is quite a feat given the number of orifices he is required to display.:::1:::B-
Get Him to the Greek ticks all the boxes. It's a satire on rock'n'roll, with Russell Brand as a drugs- and booze-addled English rock star who's trying to restart his career and get back his lost love, model-turned-singer Jackie Q (a Cockney Rose Byrne):::1:::3/5
As funny as it often is, the longer it goes on, the more one gets the feeling that, aside from getting them to the Greek, Stoller had no real idea where he was taking his characters.:::1:::2.5/4
... sets a new standard for stupid ...:::0:::2/5
Raunchy, wild and offbeat - not unlike Russell Brand himself -- 'Get Him to the Greek' is a grownups-only comedy romp.:::1:::3/4
What we have here is a great idea for a comedy and a script that's at least a dozen rewrites away from greatness.:::0:::None
Only die hard Russell Brand fans will enjoy this sequel of sorts to "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" which I've already forgotten:::0:::3/10
I can't say it is the hit of the summer, but this film should definitely be on your must see list that you can rock out to.:::1:::3/5
...replete with crude language, vomit, prolific drug use, infidelity, and generally low class manners and morals, all Apatow staples...f-bombs and vomit are not humor.:::0:::3/10
The movie's story is conventional in shape, but it has passages of crazy exhilaration and brilliant invention.:::1:::None
The pseudo-sequel to 2008's overachieving Forgetting Sarah Marshall plays upside-down musical chairs with d--k jokes and innuendo until the only place to sit is on its own thumb. And then the bottom drops out.:::0:::2/4
You'll O.D. on your own laughter!:::1:::3.5/4
Part of me is ashamed to admit that I really enjoyed this film.:::1:::None
Brand's performance in this film is bold and brilliant, and it is supremely complemented by Hill's very funny physical humor and nuanced acting.:::1:::None
This outrageous rock parody offers typical crude comedy from producer Apatow's factory.:::0:::C+
If not for the likable Hill and the very believable Brand, the film would be a total bust.:::0:::3/5
The drugged-out, womanizing, self-obsessed, rehab-riddled rock star has preened many times on screen. But Russell Brand makes Aldous Snow more than a coked-up cliche.:::1:::B-
I laughed quite frequently and recommend the picture on that count, but Greek's insights into the "sex, drugs, rock and roll" mindset are what really turn it into something special.:::1:::3/4
Hill is great, but he's just like the last five main characters in these sort of films. Thankfully, Brand's excellent and wildly original performance makes up for this for the most part, so it's not much of a problem.:::1:::B
It's a shaggy tale containing a fair number of jokes that miss their intended targets by a wide berth. But the bits that do work -- and there are many -- are comic gold; fans of raunchy cinema can do far worse.:::1:::2.5/4
Get Him to the Greek is a fun ride that will lead you down some pretty corrupt paths. Enjoy!:::1:::7.5/10
"Just like its rock-star protagonist, this rollicking road comedy may be sloppy and disjointed, but it puts on one hell of a show.":::1:::3/5
dares to go to some very dark places and does so without losing its absurdist bite:::1:::4/5
Stoller insists on investing his randy rock star with, you know, feelings. ... These moments of pathos take away from Brand's gift for scathing and transgressive comedy.:::0:::2.5/4
A key indicator as to whether or not you will be at all interested in this movie is whether or not you liked Russell Brand playing this character in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Otherwise it's close to great, with weird pacing.:::1:::3.5/5
Get yourself to see the Greek. It's raunchy, tasteless, hilarious, and surprisingly poignant (at times).:::1:::3/4
Get Him to the Greek is a worthy companion piece to the underrated 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall':::1:::3/4
Watching a bewildered fat man try to reign in an uncontrollable party animal is pretty funny.:::1:::4/5
Those hoping for a summer celebration of wretched excess to rival The Hangover need wait no longer.:::1:::4/5
With Diddy on the scene, playing (what else?) a music exec, the movie is a very funny, often outrageously take on the music industry.:::1:::2.5/4
Making Aldous regret his wicked ways is a buzz-kill of major proportions.:::0:::2/4
Brand and Hill have an outrageous and hilarious blast that rocks and rolls with constant comedy.:::1:::4/5
Cheerfully profane in the manner of a dormitory bull session.:::1:::3/4
...an entertaining romp that can't quite muster up the majesty to rank with the classics of the comedic genre:::1:::3/5
This is personality comedy, and Brand and Hill have it to spare.:::1:::B-
I don't know how many comedies I've seen over the past few years where I could count the number of laughs on my own two hands, but with Get Him to the Greek you'd need as many extremities as a centipede to keep an accurate tab.:::1:::3.5/5
A veering, careening joy ride of excess and heart.:::1:::3.5/5
A little bit of Russell Brand can go a long way, but Greek is a fine vehicle for his mock rock-god persona.:::1:::4.5/5
An unappealing comedy about uninteresting people in the music business.:::0:::1/5
Original buddy comedy is full of drugs, sex, rock 'n' roll.:::1:::4/5
If the film hadn't made a beeline toward the "serious movie with a message" category we could have had another Hangover or Tropic Thunder on our hands.:::1:::B-
You see the serious stuff as just another bad joke.:::0:::2/5
Memo to self: I never want to see Jonah Hill's bare behind again. Nevertheless, this year's Judd Apatow-produced, R-rated, raunchy breakout hit is going to be "Get Him to the Greek.":::1:::B+
With his sly send-up of the world of celebrity (e.g., cause-of-the-week pageants, avaricious relatives penning tell-all books), Stoller's take on the buddy road trip comedy is punch drunk fun.:::1:::7/10
[Has] several crazy sequences and plenty of hilarious, scattershot jokes.:::1:::2.5/4
One of the most surprisingly enjoyable and consistent comedies of the year.:::1:::3.5/5
It's the classic buddy-road trip structure. A repressed character and a raging id go on a journey and we get all kinds of bad behavior and then some lessons learned:::1:::B
A few too many grossout gags, but this is inspired lunacy, with P. Diddy (!) delivering one of the funniest performances of the year.:::1:::4/5
It's rare that a previously established side character, no matter how well loved, can deliver the goods in his own show. Which is probably why nobody tries it with movies. Well, nobody but the makers of Get Him to the Greek.:::0:::2/4
It's like "My Favorite Year," if Peter O'Toole had tried to smuggle a small bag of heroin through airport security by having Mark Linn-Baker hide it inside himself.:::1:::3/4
While it does contain a number of big laughs throughout, both the film and the character grow a bit tiresome after a while:::0:::3/5
We get a heaping helping of randy, dirty, outrageous humor, along with a generous sprinkling of sentimentality, but Get Him To The Greek doesn't need the sappiness.:::1:::2.5/4
Get Him to the Greek is filled with consistent laughs and classic comedic moments. I never thought I would see the day where I would say that Diddy is a comedic genius.:::1:::4/5
Some of the raunchy bits are amusing, but others prove that funny doesn't automatically follow from dirty.:::0:::2.5/4
One of the better cinematic portraits of a rock star in recent years but, unquestionably, the funniest film released so far in 2010.:::1:::3.5/4
Sloppily edited scenes are worsened by desperate performances and dialogue that amounts to frenzied screaming and running about.:::0:::1/4
Watching Get Him to the Greek feels like being at a party with a bunch of wasted people who think they're funnier than they are.:::0:::1/4
Although not as consistently strong as its predecessor and losing a significant amount of steam near the end as it goes touchy-feely, this pic offers plenty of laughs, most of them extremely adult and risque in nature. (Parental Review also Available):::1:::None
Granted, it's only June and there is still plenty of 2010 left, but if the world were to end tomorrow, Get Him to the Greek would easily go down as the funniest movie of the year.:::1:::8/10
Get Him to the Greek, in all its raunchy glory, is the best comedy of 2010 (thus far).:::1:::A-
Best described as a lovable train wreck.:::1:::B-
the movie is ultimately an intense buzz-kill for anyone wishing to indulge in some vicarious lifestyle vulgarity, as it comes across as too much of a downer in shining a light on the underlying ugliness of the excessive rock-star ethos.:::0:::2.5/4
It has enough bursts of hilarity sprinkled throughout it to be worth seeing.:::1:::B-
Reaches its apex with a manic party scene that unleashes the full intimidation of P. Diddy and guarantees the phrase "stroke the furry wall" a place in the comedy lexicon...:::1:::2.5/4
[T]hose who prefer their comedy raunchy and unsubtle will have a good time.:::1:::2.5/5
The madness has method, even if it's written in vomit.:::1:::3/4
You'd think Apatow's dick flicks would have gotten tired by now, but for those who like this strain of humor, Greek is another winner.:::1:::None
Deserves to be Jonah Hill's breakthrough, proof that he has what it takes to become a leading man, no matter how unlikely that may seem by Hollywood's standards.:::1:::2.5/4
An impulsive, slapstick creation, leaning on the snappy one-liner skills of the two leads, while Stoller dutifully sets the dominoes. It's broad, playfully bizarre moviegoing experience.:::1:::B+
The best parts...are the hilarious music video parodies and the film's revelation is the comic chops of Rose Byrne as Jackie Q, Aldous's on again, off again girlfriend:::1:::B
So comically fertile and yet so grounded in the reality of its characters that it's really a kind of marvel.:::1:::4/4
The setup isn't especially interesting or original, but the movie gets better as it goes through its paces.:::1:::None
The concept is inspired, and the movie has some very funny moments. But about halfway through this long weekend, the frantic tale grows flimsy.:::0:::2.5/4
Moments of utter hilarity occur, but director Nicholas Stoller seems unsure which of the two is his real protagonist, and the incidents of idiocy are more isolated than escalating.:::1:::B
Get Him to the Greek is a second-class act with a terrific front man. Suddenly it feels safer to know that it's Brand reviving Dudley Moore's role in a remake of Arthur.:::1:::B
Get Him to the Greek displays the bawdy-sweet mixture that is the signature of the Judd Apatow school of screen comedy.:::1:::3/5
Get Him to the Greek has some big laughs, and it scores an endless source of points by skewering the rock-star lifestyle.:::1:::2.5/4
Far from innovative and even farther from subtle, but it's one of the more genuinely enjoyable products to come out of the Apatow factory.:::1:::B
When one of the funniest moments in the comedy you've just made is the Paul Krugman cameo, you should wrap things up quickly.:::0:::C-
There's no buildup, no narrative arc, just one scene of comically debauched partying after another.:::0:::None
Nobody goes to an R-rated man-love comedy for spiritual renewal. We just want more outlandish gags. Down with the uplift; up with the suppository jokes.:::0:::None
Looking for a buddy comedy with wit, heart and scatological charm to spare? Get thee to this Greek.:::1:::3/4
Aside from the useless gross-out scenes, Stoller and a perfectly tuned Brand get every detail right, including the seductive egomania of celebrities and the predatory fawning of their handlers.:::1:::4/5
Stoller ... apparently has major trust issues with his odd-couple stars, women and the audience. Did I forget anybody?:::0:::2.5/5
Like the best Apatow films, this follow-up ties your emotions into the characters while your mind reels in convulsions of joy.:::1:::3/4
Making Brand's character the center of this project results in a flick with a split personality: half gross-out comedy and half depressing biopic of a star besieged by drugs, drink and dysfunction. It's far more sad than funny.:::0:::2/4
Much snappy dialogue keeps the far-fetched shenanigans from collapsing into stupidity, and agile performances create genuineness in the relationships. Foremost is Brand, whose wry intelligence inspires an enormously appealing presence.:::1:::3/4
The movie functions as a scabrous satire of the lives of the rich, famous, stupid, self-absorbed and marginally talented, with a barely disguised contempt for what passes for pop culture these days.:::1:::B
The film succeeds as a music-industry satire, a very naughty version of Almost Famous.:::1:::3/4
I wouldn't want to imagine Greek without Brand:::0:::2.5/5
If the movie's all too predictable in its broad outlines, it's scurrilously funny in the details, and it pushes its two leads and one of its supporting actors in entertainingly fresh directions. For early June, that's enough.:::1:::2.5/4
There are a lot of illegal drugs in Get Him to the Greek, and the movie itself sort of works like one. It's tempting, mood-altering and the laughs are addictive.:::1:::3/4
Screenwriter/director Nicholas Stoller can't decide what he wants to say. At times it's a music-industry spoof -- as witnessed by a series of increasingly unfunny music videos. They only undercut the more serious, somewhat heartfelt moments.:::0:::2/4
Hill, dialing back on the pissy vulgarity of his supporting roles in Knocked Up and Funny People, makes the perfect foil, as passive and impressionable as Brand is reckless and impulsive.:::1:::B
The first half of this road-trip comedy is a rollicking good time, but the energy flags when it takes a sudden detour into more dramatic territory.:::0:::None
A bold and hilarious comedy that says something astute about us, our idols and how all that sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll really isn't everything it's cracked up to be.:::1:::A-
The film feels like a collection of sketches instead of a mad, three-day, drug-and-sex-infused whirl.:::0:::2.5/5
The fact that much of Greek is funny-- crassly funny, sometimes obviously funny-- saves it, and may even allow you to forgive its indulgences.:::1:::3.5/5
Unapologetically crude and shamelessly silly.:::1:::7/10
One wonders if there is a Jason Segel-penned version of this script in Universal's vault that was rejected for not being "wacky" enough. If so, whoops.:::1:::3/5
It's not quite infectious, but some of the high notes manage to drown out some of the guttural lows.:::1:::2.5/4
The film swings between performance gags (and no one can do this better than Russell Brand), well-scripted zings, random absurdity (Paul Krugman reaction shot FTW!) and some really sharp editing.:::1:::A-
Under Apatow's direction, when boys move beyond their base desires, it's character development. Under Stoller's, it's a buzzkill.:::0:::None
Boundless, raunchy energy defines this intermittently funny comedy, which is well acted and unpretentious; the idea of watching a film with normal running time and without CGI effects is refreshing.:::1:::C+
Russell Brand's "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" character gets a movie all his own. The result is, as you might imagine, too much of a good thing.:::0:::2/4
Both Brand and Hill are funny performers but neither is well-served by Stoller's slack script. The longer the film goes on, the more the seams show.:::0:::None
The movie's a good, rude commercial comedy. How many good movies have we even seen this year?:::1:::3/4
The reason the friendship works is that Russell Brand and Jonah Hill are good actors. Hill's character is required to be blotto half of the time, but there's the sense that he's desperately trying to do the right thing.:::1:::3/4
During his many drug-induced freakouts [Hill] looks like a fat baby laughing. That's a weirdly endearing image that even people who don't envy the rock star lifestyle can love.:::1:::3.5/5
A clever spin-off that allows the two actors who helped make Sarah Marshall so hilarious to flourish on their own ... certainly stands a good chance at being one of the funniest comedies this summer.:::1:::8.5/10
Designed to capture "The Hangover" crowd, this wild and wooly comedy sneaks up on you. While it's not The Greatest Comedy Ever Made, this one sure does offer up some pretty darn funny moments.:::1:::None
Get Him to the Greek turns out to be the funniest hard-R comedy since The Hangover.:::1:::3/4
It has a rambly, realistic tone, with one orgiastic mishap spilling into the next, and that tone keeps much of the action popping with surprise.:::1:::B
With Sarah Marshall, Stoller made audiences hungry for more Aldous Snow; after Get Him to the Greek, they'll be happy never to see the guy again.:::0:::2/5
An overdose of pop-culture and some memorable set-ups make this a very amusing commentary on the foibles of rock stardom.:::1:::3.5/5
Let's face it, a little of this guy goes a long way.:::0:::None
Greek doesn't quite know when to stop, and things aren't brought to a particularly satisfying resolution. But Brand does a nice job adding a few dramatic shadings to his character, a pleasant surprise. And Hill is outstanding.:::1:::4/5
Greek might be this year's The Hangover.:::1:::3/4
If this sounds like a remake of My Favorite Year for the new millennium, well, it is. Being a Judd Apatow production, it's also sweet-natured, despite an unrelenting onslaught of raunch.:::1:::3/4
The heavyset Hill is beginning to cultivate a likable John Candy-esque appeal; playing against the surprisingly sharp Sean Combs, as a hellacious boss, he grounds the movie in approachability as the orbiting players get crazier.:::1:::3/5
Goes for the heartstrings by way of the rectum and feels sorely uneven as a result.:::1:::None
Brand takes center stage as the fatuously cocksure singer, but the episodic screenplay strains to give the British comic enough juicy moments to be amusingly inn raging to see this movie since it was announced, has already called it "life-changing." How do you argue with that?:::0:::3/5
No better than a run-of-the-mill made-for-cable movie on any network that caters to pre-teens...[but] boys of a certain age--six to ten, perhaps--may enjoy [it].:::0:::C-
For all its ridiculousness, its enthusiastic comic excess, and its fart/booger/gross-out jokes, Diary Of A Wimpy Kid's heart is firmly in the right place.:::1:::B-
A snappy, humorous, and creative comedy about an ambitious pre-teen boy whose expends all his energy trying to win the approval of his middle-school peers.:::1:::4/5
Diary of a Wimpy Kid is an adequate adaptation of Kinney's novel, but no replacement for the real thing.:::0:::2.5/4
In transferring the clean, precise humor of Kinney's illustrations and prose to the big-screen, the material loses just a bit of its charm.:::0:::None
This group project produces no voice of its own, just faintly entertaining echoes of better movies and television shows.:::0:::2/4
Diary of a Wimpy Kid is an amusing romp through the awkward years of middle school.:::1:::None
The movie is remarkably attuned to that awful period when you're not just known but sometimes doomed by the company you keep.:::1:::None
Delivers rare insight about kids growing up at different speeds ... If only the movie didn't so frequently turn reality into a literal and figurative cartoon.:::1:::3/5
The casting's pretty fair, and if they had better material, Steve Zahn and Rachael Harris would have been real assets. But the story lurches from indignity to ill-starred wrestling match to gross-out gag, without any momentum or surprise.:::0:::1.5/4
It's nimble, bright and funny. It doesn't dumb down. It doesn't patronize. It knows something about human nature. It isn't as good as A Christmas Story, as few movies are, but it deserves a place in the same sentence.:::1:::3.5/4
Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a likable movie for kids that will make adults chuckle as well because of the movie's key ingredient -- wit.:::1:::None
A jaunty and forthright production with a lively look reflecting the book's illustrated pages [that] does a great job of being in two places at once: In the head and gangly bodies of kids, and in the hearts of those of us who have survived grades 6-8.:::1:::B+
A litany of humiliations befalls the protagonist, fitting given that this adaptation of Jeff Kinney's popular kids-lit series is itself a minor embarrassing misfire.:::0:::2/4
Diary of a Wimpy Kid is sweet and funny at either end, but in between, it sags with endless repetition of gross bodily functions and Greg's torment at the hands of larger, angrier, or more popular kids -- in that order.:::0:::None
:::0:::1/5
:::1:::3/4
A command of genre creativity blended with human insight.:::1:::3.5/4
How to Train Your Dragon 2 isn't just a great sequel, a great animated spectacle, or a great example of successful franchise-expansion/world-building. How to Train Your Dragon 2 is flat-out great film, period:::1:::9.5/10
It's a rare sequel - animated or otherwise - that expands the story of its predecessor without rehashing it, and an even rarer family-oriented film that manages to be fun and mature without being condescending to its audience. [It] does both.:::1:::None
With writer-director Dean DeBlois back at the helm, the sequel feels like a solid continuation of the first movie.:::1:::3/4
Here and there, it's as if the mythology of Tolkien has been filtered through the imagery of Miyazaki.:::1:::3/4
Bigger and even richer than the terrific 2010 hit animation, this sequel is also quite possibly the best action-adventure movie of the year.:::1:::5/5
A triumph that soars far beyond a lazy re-tread of the original. It is altogether darker, richer and more complex.:::1:::4/5
Funny, big-hearted and - as you'd expect - a visual feast, this a family film in every sense and one to be lapped-up by both kids and grown-ups alike.:::1:::5/5
The characters in this movie are charmers. They've got me so well-trained, I'm even looking forward to HTTYD3.:::1:::3/5
It has a richness that's highly compelling, especially in the way it explores the complex relationship between man and beast.:::1:::4/5
Only for those addicted to video games and the Transformer series. The original was bright, funny and inventive. The sequel not so.:::0:::None
The filmmakers borrow freely from Avatar, Sword In The Stone and even Brave but they bring enough vigour and imagination to their storytelling to get away with it.:::1:::4/5
The sequel doesn't attempt to take things in a completely new direction, choosing instead to expand its world and characters with great success.:::1:::4/5
This swooping and soaring sequel boasts big thrills, innovative set-pieces and a surprisingly radical political outlook.:::1:::4/5
Textures and gestures are brilliantly rendered, the body language saying more about the characters and their relationships than any words ...:::1:::4/5
Despite the unimaginative title, How To Train Your Dragon 2 arrives full of its predecessor's invention, wit and flair.:::1:::4/5
Bigger, braver and even more visually rewarding than the original, it's an ambitious attempt to extend the scope of its predecessor without sacrificing the charm, humour and excitement that made that so appealing.:::1:::4/5
This sequel forms a well-balanced symbiotic relationship between the entertainingly silly and the deadly serious.:::1:::None
Hats off to Dreamworks for offering some bold surprises in a respectable sequel filled with moments of humour and emotion among its ample noise and movement.:::1:::3/5
Written and directed with admirable verve by Dean DeBlois, How to Train Your Dragon ticks all the important boxes required of top quality family-friendly animation.:::1:::None
At times terrifying and too tough for tinies, this is nevertheless a triumphant sequel that puts its faith in Hiccup and Toothless to find a way through dark times for man and dragon.:::1:::4/5
A textbook lesson in 'How to Do A Sequel.':::1:::A-
his franchise has swiftly proven itself to be one that has heart to match its dazzling visuals - it exists in a world that feels tactile, for once the 3D isn't crushingly disappointing.:::1:::3/5
Not as fresh or funny as its 2010 predecessor but with a bang-up second half, much visual beauty and a surprising emotional resonance.:::1:::3.5/5
This isn't just a more soulful movie, it's a much more spectacular one too. At times, it makes it's glossy rivals look like they belong in the Dark Ages:::1:::4/5
Underneath the surface, there's a depth and thoughtfulness to the story that makes this sequel a worthy successor to the 2010 original.:::1:::None
It begs the question: Are animated studio such as Pixar and DreamWorks catering to a much more mature audience? Or are they pushing the hearts and minds of wee-ones into new, dark boundaries?:::1:::4/5
Game of What? This is our new desert island dragon-themed pop pick.:::1:::4/5
There's actually a point about 90 minutes in where things take a very dark turn, and I momentarily thought the movie was going to end on an incredible down note.:::1:::3.5/5
The swirl of storylines, plot twists and huge battles might prove a tad too intense for kids under 10, and even adults will have to pay close attention...Still, the film can't be faulted for its movement, humour or [its] sheer beauty.:::1:::3.5/5
I think that's what's wrong with this. The minor characters don't emerge from this at all. I'm hard pressed to discern one from the other.:::0:::None
An efficient and entertaining franchise sequel, but it restates how conventionally Americanised this property has become in comparison with the literary original ...:::1:::3/5
'How to Train Your Dragon 2' is a rich and satisfying movie of surprising substance.:::1:::None
An absolute delight, even better than the first film; a gorgeously animated ode to peacemaking, nonconformity, and sticking to your principles in the face of ultimate adversity.:::1:::None
Those who made [this film] know the kids who adored the original have grown since the [first one] and they're trying mightily to grow with them. That counts for something in today's popular culture universe, even if they seem to be trying awfully hard.:::1:::3.5/5
The writer and director Dean DeBlois takes the comedy to a deeper, more satisfying place than he did in the original franchise-launching animated film.:::1:::None
It might ramp up the action and the emotional ties in the story but does very little with the original's main attribute: originality.:::0:::None
While this film is a bit weaker, and a lot darker, than the first, it does have a strong story, interesting characters and great digital animation.:::1:::B
Overlong and overly busy but more emotionally powerful than its predecessor.:::1:::B+
Unable to settle on any one story idea in particular, writer-director Dean DeBlois throws in three or four, which intersect at odd moments, like cars at a busy intersection, refusing to give the right of way, so that no one ends up going anywhere fast.:::0:::1/5
The most distinctive thing about the series is its strictly rational handling of fantasy themes. The dragons themselves can be fearsome or adorable - but since they don't speak, they're treated for the most part as pieces of hardware or beasts of burden.:::0:::2.5/5
How to Train Your Dragon 2 is the most solid, light, and enjoyable fantasy film of the summer.:::1:::4/5
There's something uniquely appealing, especially to kids, about animals acting like animals.:::1:::7/10
It isn't important how many dragons DeBlois crams into a movie. It's how many figurative dragons, breathing sameness into animation, he'll continue to slay.:::1:::B+
One of the top handful of movies ever made by DreamWorks Animation, but pretty much across-the-board weaker than the original How to Train Your Dragon.:::1:::7/10
I'm so impressed I actually saw a movie where I plonked down the coin for 3D and felt like I hadn't been robbed.:::1:::4/5
The entire film is a romance -- visually, parentally, ecologically. It's got the emotional, humorous, exciting sweep you want from a summer movie.:::1:::None
Dragon 2 does what every sequel should do, but few even attempt - expand the horizons of its original.:::1:::3.5/4
A rarity because this sequel outdoes the original.:::1:::8/10
A visual stunner with aerial sequences that will take your breath away, and many of the dogfights (dragonfights?) have that Star Wars sizzle.:::1:::3.5/5
A great sequel feels fresh and familiar all at the same time, which is why 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' is a great sequel.:::1:::4.5/5
Waging peace can be every bit as heroic and satisfying as waging war.:::1:::4.5/5
DeBlois thankfully remembers everything the two of them did right in the previous film.:::1:::4/5
If 'How to Train Your Dragon' was a raging inferno of emotion, the sequel is more like a warm, cozy campfire.:::1:::B
With its stunning visuals, majestic score, compelling perspectives, its massive yet impressive sense of scope, and its breathtaking camera angles, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is undeniably phenomenal and the undisputed animated film of the summer.:::1:::10/10
It's entertaining and gorgeous, but disjointed, veering between wildly emotional scenes on both ends of the spectrum without much thought for how they should flow together.:::1:::3/5
The film isn't afraid to occasionally saunter over to the dark side. How dark? Let's just say there's a late-breaking development here that will result in some moviegoers tagging it as this film's Vader-flavored "I am your father" moment.:::1:::3/4
Every bit as endearing as the original, if not even more stirring, 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' is full of humor, loss, adventure and romance. In other words, it has the same themes, lovable characters and beautiful look that made the original a hit.:::1:::3.5/4
How refreshing it is to find a summer sequel that's not simply louder or wackier than its predecessor, but rather feels like an extension of its first film and all of its best qualities.:::1:::3.5/4
Although there are times when bits of the movie feel extraneous, the production as a whole comes across more like an organic extension of the original tale than something tacked on purely to score at the box office.:::1:::3/4
As serious as Dragon 2 gets with some sad scenes of betrayal and death, returning writer-director Dean DeBlois infuses a sense of joyfulness throughout.:::1:::None
Epic, thrilling 3-D adventure sequel is outstanding.:::1:::5/5
I loved the first "How to Train Your Dragon". But this movie is mired in lengthy oratories which come off as preachy and full of righteous indignation.:::1:::None
It's a joy to behold.:::1:::None
In the bigger is better world of Hollywood sequels, How to Train Your Dragon 2 comes up short. It lacks the novelty of the original and tries too hard to be "about" something more than fun.:::0:::3/5
A bigger, and arguably better, sequel experience that features more dragons, larger scale action set pieces, as well as a poignant message on the challenges of growing up.:::1:::4.5/5
An inspired and inspiring piece of escapism, this one will get the kids cheering on their feet and the grown-ups blubbering in their seats.:::1:::4/5
The visuals are often astounding. Believe me, I take no joy in recommending a 3-D viewing, but I can only see it adding to this experience.:::1:::B
How to Train Your Dragon 2 will be tough for your kids to watch, and some of it will require explaining and discussion -- which alone makes it mean and matter more than the majority of designed-to-be-forgotten animated films in theaters these days.:::1:::5/5
It's clear that [director Dean DeBlois] took inspiration from the first Star Wars trilogy - not a bad model for breathing new life, and yes, a bit of fire, into one of Hollywood's more nuanced animated franchises.:::1:::8.5/10
As much as 3D detracted from, say, Man of Steel, so does it enhance How to Train Your Dragon 2. Call it How to Train Your Cranky Elders That 3D is Good Sometimes.:::1:::None
How to Train Your Dragon 2 is soaring, emotionally swooping, utterly satisfying fun.:::1:::None
Not only does this second movie match the charm, wit, animation skill and intelligent storytelling of the original, I think it even exceeds it.:::1:::4/4
Despite its expanded, ambitious battle sequences, Dragon 2 is at its best when it quiets down and dares to be intimate.:::1:::None
One of the most beautiful animated films ever made.:::1:::3.5/4
Witty, rousing, heartwarming, sensational-looking, and at times touching, uplifting and even moving---and proof that Hollywood's still making movies that virtually all ages can enjoy, appreciate and admire.:::1:::4/5
An adventure for the eyes, and one forged with great imagination.:::1:::4/4
Just like the first film, when it's done you want to run out and pick up your own dragon.:::1:::4/5
As with the Ice Age sequels, situations may change and characters may come and go, but the central characters and relationships forged in the first film have become static.:::0:::C+
While delivering the epic goods, the How to Train Your Dragon franchise continues to keep its eye on helping kids become better people, and that's a cause worth fighting for.:::1:::3/4
Dreamworks sure knows HOW to make a sequel: just add more dragons!:::1:::8.5/10
Can we give it a rating of PG-10 or PG-11?:::1:::2.5/4
More than just teaching kids what to think about the world they're coming into, it's a rare film that encourages them to think for themselves.:::1:::4/4
This was not a sequel that anybody needed, outside of the accountants. And there's another already planned.:::0:::2.5/4
One of this year's true surprises, the superior animated sequel not only is infused with the same independent spirit and off-kilter aesthetic that enriched the original, it also deepens the first film's major themes.:::1:::3.5/4
There's a genuine sense of wonder captured, an almost glorious feeling of flight and freedom, reveling in the sheer cinematic pleasure of being taken along for the ride.:::1:::A-
Provides a grandiose feeling that you're watching something truly special.:::1:::9.5/10
The visuals are stunning, with thrillingly vertiginous 3D swoops and soars, and there's a love scene as tender as you will see on screen this year.:::1:::A-
The sequel -- even with its flaws -- is full of enough fun and action to entertain youngsters and has enough emotional moments to hold the attention of adults.:::1:::B
It takes what worked the first time and expands upon it, offering bigger, darker, more mature ideas without diminishing the original film.:::1:::3.5/5
It's a rip-roaring ride.:::1:::None
Graded on the animated-sequel curve, "How to Train Your Dragon 2" doesn't come off too badly.:::1:::B
Nothing in this likable sequel flies quite so high as those aerial shots.:::1:::2.5/4
Young and old fans of the first movie will be lining up for the wit, for the inventiveness of the characters, for the breathtaking visuals - and just the sheer fun of it all.:::1:::3.5/4
"How to Train Your Dragon 2" succeeds because it builds on, but doesn't try to replicate, the magic of the first movie.:::1:::3/4
It's just a bummer that such a pretty package lacks any real substance.:::0:::2.5/4
Offering a dramatically darker story, this feature serves as an animated homage to 'The Empire Strikes Back.':::1:::4.5/5
Writer/director Dean DeBlois's second of a planned trilogy based on Cressida Cowell's children's books has a daring, shocking climax and its underlying theme could be read as championing the maligned pit bull breed...:::1:::B+
In a summer filled with engaging entertainments, this is one of the best.:::1:::4.5/5
This is far removed from the innocent simplicity of its predecessor; How to Train Your Dragon 2 sees this series growing up -- quickly and for the better.:::1:::3.5/4
While a lot of recent animated movies stuff the screen with bright colors, frantic action, and constant wisecracks, How to Train Your Dragon 2, like its prequel, has managed to focus on something more important - a sense of awe.:::1:::None
Not since Toy Story has an animated movie managed to feel so fresh and vibrant with its second helping.:::1:::3.5/4
This may be the first and last time anyone says this, but if "How to Train Your Dragon 2" is this good, why stop at 3 and 4?:::1:::3.5/4
Most sequels get made for commercial reasons, whether or not the world needs them. "How to Train Your Dragon 2" is a movie the world needs.:::1:::None
The impressive part is the storytelling confidence of writer/director Dean DeBlois. He has created a thoughtful tale as meaningful for grown-ups as it is pleasurable for its young primary audience.:::1:::4/4
Nearly as exuberant as the original, How to Train Your Dragon 2 nimbly avoids sequel-itis.:::1:::3/4
Taking its cues as much from Star Wars and Game of Thrones as from its own storybook narrative, How to Train Your Dragon 2 breathes fire into a franchise sequel.:::1:::3/4
Casual viewers will be entertained, critics will find enough new artistic nuances to give the okay, and those at the studio should be happy with what will likely be handsome financial results. (Full Content Review for Parents also Available):::1:::None
Toothless is so vividly, viscerally animated, I worry a child will look askance at her own humble dog and peevishly wonder why Fluffernutter can't fly, or at the very least breathe fire.:::1:::3.5/5
A solid sequel sets its goals and meets them, but a movie as elating as How to Train Your Dragon 2 soars beyond conventional objectives and upends audience expectations.:::1:::A
Its thundering air-war sequences, with hordes of dragon-riding fighters swarming into battle, have the swooping, gliding kineticism of vintage newsreels of World War II dogfights.:::1:::None
More emotional, exhilarating and expansive than the original. DreamWorks finally has a franchise to match its ambition.:::1:::4/5
For once, we have an animated sequel free of the committee-job vibe so common at every animation house, no matter the track record.:::1:::3.5/4
Gruesome? A little. Scary? You bet. But that's exactly what makes the "Dragon" films so different, and so much better, than the average children's fare.:::1:::3/4
How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a sequel that will inevitably be compared with its predecessor, and while it doesn't reach the level of that original film, it still acts as a decent continuation of the story.:::1:::3/4
DeBlois, who also wrote the script, successfully juggles the multiple story lines, shifting allegiances and uncharted lands.:::1:::3/4
Dragon 2, like The Empire Strikes Back, takes sequels to a new level of imagination and innovation. It truly is a high-flying, depth-charging wonder to behold.:::1:::3.5/4
'Bigger' pretty much describes this sequel to the 2010 sleeper hit - as opposed to, say, 'different.':::0:::1/5
For audiences who want a sweet story, they can't beat the first film of a boy finding his best friend. For those who are ready for the next stage, try this one about a boy becoming a man.:::1:::3/4
It's the unflinching edge that gives the film its unexpected depth.:::1:::3/5
The film's real emotional heart comes from its unabashed fanboy love of dragons.:::1:::4/5
Overall, a very worthy follow-up.:::1:::4/5
While 'Dragon 2' is a rather different critter from 'Dragon 1'--bigger, more sprawling and preachier--it has no less heart and humor, and is a rousing adventure besides.:::1:::B+
The unusual second chapter that hits new heights in almost every way.:::1:::3.5/4
By taking its time in the 4 years since the 1st movie, Dreamworks has mounted a superior 2nd installment, one that gives heretofore untapped personality to its characters and an extra shot of heart to the touching, age-old tale of a Viking and his dragon.:::1:::2.5/4
The animation simply rules. Elegant and detailed, the film soars and whooshes with the craft that all animated movies should have.:::1:::3/4
An impressive sequel that leaves us cheering for the noble ideal of animals and humans living together in peace and harmony.:::1:::4.5/5
Flying high among this summer's blockbusters - it's enchanting!:::1:::8/10
As a reviewer who greeted the first film with lukewarm praise the reaction is much different this time. It joins that short list of sequels that surpass their originals.:::1:::4/5
There aren't just more dragons, but more characters, more plot, more everything. The trade-off is that the charm of the original gets a little lost, a casualty of rapid-franchise expansion.:::1:::B-
Offers some stunningly beautiful sequences and an engaging, if at times quite dark, story line.:::1:::3/4
The plot is unfocused and jumbled, borrowing elements from other fantasy movies without bringing them together into a cohesive whole.:::0:::2.5/5
This isn't product that deserves a trophy just for showing up; it's a high water mark for DreamWorks and a huge accomplishment for DeBlois.:::1:::A-
As far as animated action-adventure outings go, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a solid and exciting offering for those to whom the franchise appeals.:::1:::3/5
The flight path needs straightening, but this is still a franchise that knows appropriate.:::0:::None
The comic premise still works like a charm.:::1:::None
Get Him to the Greek is a complete blast, a much-needed breath of fresh air - well, as much fresh air as you can get in crowded clubs, packed rock shows and trashed hotel suites.:::1:::None
It's crude, loud, dumb fun. And, on top of that, it contains the greatest cameo ever by a winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics.:::1:::None
... it is curious that a movie build around a deadline as firm as this manages to feel as casually paced as this one.:::1:::None
Russell Brand is still the best thing here, but at least he gets to be onscreen a helluva lot more than he was in Sarah Marshall. Alas that onscreen just as often is Jonah Hill...:::0:::None
The Forgetting Sarah Marshall crew-and yes, that includes producer Judd Apatow-have a follow-up gig that's not to be missed.:::1:::4/5
Barring a few lapses, the gags fly by in rapid-fire fashion, and enough of them connect -- thanks in part to the amusing mix of Hill's hang-dog demeanor with Brand's lanky, relentless hedonism.:::1:::None
A giddy Diddy turn aside, this wildly uneven comedy doesn't travel very far.:::0:::None
"Get Him to the Greek" has all the earmarks of a Judd Apatow spin-off, and that's a good thing.:::1:::B
This wild, unrestrained roller coaster ride of vulgar, demented debauchery is - so far, as of early June - the funniest movie of the year.:::1:::7/10
B-list Apatow with moments of laugh-out-loud hilarity.:::1:::B-
Now here's a relatively new (if not necessarily welcome) idea: the sorta-kinda-not-really sequel.:::0:::2/4
The real story here is P. Diddy, who owns this movie. At the end of the second act he explodes as a comic dynamo.:::1:::None

We're shown real life problems in a fictional story that gives us real life solutions. Bravo Lisa, your film is more than all right.:::1:::None
Bening hoists this heavy-handed dramedy high with a burst of superhuman strength. And all you can do is sit in awe.:::1:::A-
A twist on the traditional family drama, where every character has depth and deserves redemption.:::1:::4/4
The dialog seems like it was pulled from a magazine full of bad liberal cliches. It feels as if people who used to be progressives, but want people to think they still are wrote this movie.:::0:::C
This is very tricky material to parse, mainly because the movie is telling us one thing in dialogue and showing us quite another visually.:::0:::None
What it lacks in grandstanding and pandering to the 'issues', this film more than makes up for with its great story, rounded characters and genuine sense of fun.:::1:::4/5
The Kids Are All Right is witty, touching and humane - and decidedly up to the minute.:::1:::None
Its emotional pull remains consistent to the end.:::1:::3/4
More of a breezy drama, as opposed to a weighty comedy... the ace up its sleeve, aside from its "modern family" plot device, is its characters, brought to life with welcome layers and depth by the cast.:::1:::4/5
How, despite such a talented, femme-centric cast, does Ruffalo's loveable idiot manage to walk off with the film?:::1:::3/5
Regardless of the orientations, 'The Kids Are All Right' is an all-American film.:::1:::A
The Kids Are All Right would have been a highly regarded, stinging family drama in the tradition of American Beauty and Ordinary People even if the subject family was not so proudly unorthodox.:::1:::3.5/4
A bittersweet family dramedy that challenges the perceptions of the perfect family...:::1:::None
The combined troupe do a good enough job to make the movie get by, but not enough to mask the huge gears running the story, nor the accidental and ironic anti-progressiveness the movie has the potential to convey.:::0:::5/10
A long-form sitcom overly pleased with its own progressiveness.:::0:::C-
...All the pieces are in place--I just wish Cholodenko had been a little more precious about the execution.:::0:::2/4
Without any humor in the story, this would be a very sad story about a destructive mix of personalities causing havoc in a family. But the film does have a lot of humor in it.:::1:::B+
full review at Movies for the Masses:::1:::4/5
Una sensible comedia dramatica sobre la falta de certezas (o la eterna busqueda de ellas) que implica formar una familia, mas alla de definiciones y preferencias sexuales. Excelente elenco en el que brilla especialmente Annette Bening.:::1:::3/5
if it wasn't for the distractingly wall-to-wall indie soundtrack... and mildly cop-out ending, I'd be pushing this straight to the top end of our Best of 2010 list.:::1:::None
The Kids Are All Right is warmly recommended to anyone in search of smart, grown-up entertainment.:::1:::4/5
A sleek, smart, enormously entertaining film, (....) it has the feel of a classic Hollywood comedy at its snappiest.:::1:::None
A light, lovingly handled tale about the difficulties of staying in love.:::1:::3.5/5
The film joyfully allows us to embrace, rather than escape, the wonderful, awkward embarrassment of familial love.:::1:::None
The film taps into the neuroses of middle-class America without exploiting its premise for egregious quirk value or for dry, tub-thumping agenda-setting.:::1:::4/5
Only those without a funnybone will fail to be seduced by its sheer verve, wit and charm.:::1:::5/5
This is a much better made, more persuasive film than The Switch or The Back-Up Plan but just as much about wish fulfilment, and no more honest about conflicts that can leave the kids far from all right.:::1:::None
Piercingly funny, subtle and moving.:::1:::5/5
Funny, aching, rueful -- often at the same time -- The Kids Are All Right makes most mainstream releases this year seem decadent by comparison.:::1:::4/5
An intelligent, well observed movie about adult relationships. The kids are alright but this is a film for grown ups.:::1:::None
Films about the stresses and strains of marriage don't come any better -- or more entertaining -- than this.:::1:::5/5
The film gets better and better, powered by a sharp, wise script and superlative acting.:::1:::4/5
Family-centric comedy has never felt so fresh.:::1:::4/5
A witty portrait of postmodern family life in which script, casting, direction and location all just float together without any apparent effort at all.:::1:::4/5
Best of all is Bening, capping even her performance in American Beauty, as a woman forced to face her partner's betrayal.:::1:::4/5
Smart, funny, slyly satirical and wonderfully warm, this deft 'dramedy' is bitter-sweet film-making at its best.:::1:::5/5
A witty, warm exploration of family life that's conventional and unconventional in equal measure.:::1:::4/5
There are good performances and a smart and occasionally funny script, plus some good observations about relationships, but you do wonder what the point is to it all.:::1:::3/5
So much tension doesn't quite translate into a gutsy finale, still, this film is never less than heartfelt.:::1:::4/5
it is a miracle of mainstreaming - but in making her film just like any other family drama, Cholodenko also risks bringing a certain generic blandness to her 'unconventional family'. Perhaps that is the acceptable price of equality...:::1:::None
Hugely entertaining, frequently funny and genuinely moving, this is a sharply written comedy-drama with refreshingly original characters and terrific performances from all five leads.:::1:::4/5
The Critics Are All Wrong.:::0:::2/5
Five of this year's best screen characters appear in this comedy-drama about a relatively ordinary family facing some unusual challenges. And while the premise seems extremely offbeat, it's actually beside the point.:::1:::4.5/5
There are few films as soulful and human as Lisa Cholodenko's The Kids Are All Right. That a film can set itself apart from the pack by merely being human is somewhat depressing, but there you have it.:::1:::4/5
A smart, funny, insightful take on the dynamics of Modern Families. It taps into both the universal and specific dynamics of the family unit. Bening gives a career best performance.:::1:::4/5
The Kids are All Right is funny, touching and honest, all the elements that make independent cinema so much more rewarding, most of the time, than the mainstream.:::1:::4/5
The Kids Are All Right is a film about marriage, family and parenthood and it explores these themes with far more integrity, insight and humour than many other films.:::1:::4/5
This is a witty and insightful film. Lisa Cholodenko has a talent for observational comedy; comedies which capture the zeitgeist, usually achieved by throwing together people with two different sets of expectations.:::1:::None
Common to all Cholodenko's films is a fascination with the mayhem that can result when the chronically stitched-up come up against the amoral and fancy-free.:::1:::3.5/5
The Kids Are All Right gets at basic, underlying truths, and opens them up with both sly humour and brittle neediness. Lisa Cholodenko has found her home.:::1:::4/5
A shrewd, well-observed modern comedy about achieving acceptance with no exceptions, The Kids Are All Right is the freshest feelgood film to drop in quite some time.:::1:::3/5
Excellent performances, notably Ruffalo, fuel a fine family affair.:::1:::None
What makes this film, by Lisa Cholodenko, who co-wrote it with Stuart Blumberg, work, are the performances. Annette Bening is sublime.:::1:::None
I didn't take a lot away from the film but there are some wonderfully uncomfortable scenes that make it worth seeing.:::1:::B
A near masterpiece; part sex-comedy, part radiant and wry portrait of contemporary relationships.:::1:::None
This intelligent, non-confronting film doesn't set out to change the world. Rather, it presents a compassionate view of family life today, without judgement or undue comment.:::1:::None
One of the most compelling cinematic depictions of family life to come along for some time.:::1:::None
Sure, the kids are all right, but poor dad has been beaten to a pulp!:::0:::2/5
The screenplay is beautifully honest and well observed; not only is it truthful about human nature, it finds the humanity as well as the flaws in all the characters:::1:::None
Outrageously funny situations and two sterling performances make this smartly written film about an unconventional family a sure-fire winner.:::1:::None
Rich and funny, a film that doesn't condescend or strike a single false note, and one whose structure and detail work together in lockstep.:::1:::5/5
Doesn't offer much beyond the rather depressing realization that, in today's screens, progressive sexual politics boil down to making a gay family's dysfunction as hackneyed as a straight family's:::0:::None
The leads in this beautifully told drama are more than just all right - they're Oscar worthy.:::1:::3.5/4
In a world where pop culture shields us from the truth, this movie is something of a novelty. It isn't afraid to tell it.:::1:::A-
Cholodenko... nicely grounds herself here in the mechanics of day-to-day relationship maintenance.:::1:::3.5/4
Kids more than just all right.:::1:::4.0/4.0
An ultra-contemporary, intelligent drama sprinkled with humor.:::1:::4/4
It's no less than a classic portrait of an American family.:::1:::3.5/4
Some of the year's best performances.:::1:::4.25/5
While Certainly Not its Intent, this Film is So Vapid in its Plot and Empty in Character It Ends Up Being Anti-Gay in Message.:::0:::1.5/5
Cholodenko has not delivered a pro-gay marriage treatise, but a funny, touching and relatable story about the colossal effort and love it takes to create and maintain a family.:::1:::3.4/4
It's a happy, horny movie that loves its characters and their messy human imperfections. You will, too.:::1:::None
...a wonderful thing, intelligent in the ways of human foible, and generous with sinners.:::1:::90/100
Leaves a lot on the table for those to ponder who might still be unsure if same sex marriages can work.:::1:::B+
never preachy, but instead relies on the characters to ground the issues and make them feel real, rather than manufactured:::1:::3/4
I really enjoyed being dropped into this family's world for two hours. The Kids Are All Right is one of my favorite movies so far in 2010.:::1:::3.5/4
The drama and comedy, conflict and reconciliation are fairly conventional, despite the unconventional context; what elevates the material are the marvelous performances and the agreeably loose vibe established by Cholodenko.:::1:::3/4
What starts as a comedy about unconventional family relationships turns into a drama with ironically more conventional relationships.:::1:::8/10
Problems like betrayal, disappointment, anger, regret and reconciliation are universal themes that ring true no matter what sexual orientation is featured.:::1:::3/4
A warm, funny, entertaining, slyly subversive little movie built around five very solid performances.:::1:::4.5/5
Could easily have been of a straight, infertile marriage thrown off balance by their biological donor, but then we would have been deprived of the singular pleasure of getting to watch Bening and Moore play such a wonderful married couple.:::1:::4/5
...is at its best in its early scenes...:::1:::3/4
During the Summer of 3D glasses, "The Kids are All Right" proves that what you really need to create an immersive, real-life film experience is a sharp pencil and some interesting friends.:::1:::3/4
Armed with a handful of deftly drawn characters and an occasionally wicked sense of humor, Cholodenko has created a thoroughly and unmistakably modern film.:::1:::3/4
'The Kids Are All Right' is a warm film about flawed people.:::1:::4.5/5
Buoyant and engaging.:::1:::B+
Heartfelt and funny, The Kids Are All Right is like a cool shower on an oppressively hot day-refreshing and invigorating, the sort of unexpected surprise that catches you off guard and sticks with you for days.:::1:::8/10
Sophisticated and funny, but once you get past the unusual premise and the fact that the main couple is realistically portrayed, there's nothing surprising about it.:::1:::B
A comedy that perfectly balances natural hilarity with genuine drama while exploring a whole slew of issues.:::1:::3.5/4
A slight but bittersweet tale about a neurotic lesbian couple whose formerly anonymous sperm donor becomes their potential home wrecker.:::1:::4/5
"A great drama that is sure to be remembered at Oscar time (note to the Academy &#150; the last name is spelled B-E-N-I-N-G)...":::1:::4/4
No matter what its plot particulars, The Kids Are All Right ultimately takes place within the human heart.:::1:::4/4
The Kids Are All Right is written with such perception, directed with such sensitivity and acted with such brio that the result is not only a path paved with good intentions but also one lined with loving detail.:::1:::3.5/4
It's a terrific film.:::1:::4/4
A solid family drama filled with authentic characters and some great performances from its amazing ensemble cast.:::1:::3.5/5
Definitions of family, love and friendship all get put to the test with wit and warmth in The Kids Are All Right, one of the year's most honest and endearing films.:::1:::A-
Cholodenko gets moods right, and her five leading actors have been either perfectly cast or well-handled.:::1:::3/4
It's about the slow, inevitable grind of marriage. It's about the eternally unknowable curveballs life throws at you and how you either step up to the plate toward triumph or turn away in tears or terror or both. It's about love.:::1:::4/5
Operates within a calculated, hipster environment ... (though) we eventually stop noticing because Cholodenko's ensemble is so powerful.:::1:::3/4
If you give the film a chance, it might just entertain and/or enlighten to one degree or another thanks to the solid performances, writing and the filmmaker deftly balancing all of that. (Parental Review also Available):::1:::None
The characters in the film feel real, even a bit lived-in, and it's because of the efforts of the cast; particularly those veteran actors who play the adults.:::1:::2.5/4
Funny and warm, The Kids Are All Right feels lived in and acutely observed, and is as steeped in joy as in regret.:::1:::3.5/4
Here are five gifted actors at the top of their games as five characters in search of what makes a family.:::1:::3.5/4
It's [Ruffalo's] best work since You Can Count On Me, and he's at his most likable here...:::1:::B+
Few long-term relationships have been portrayed with such a palpable feeling of shared history.:::1:::B+
Moore and Bening have showcase scenes that will make fine awards show clips, and Ruffalo's scruffy sexiness makes Jules' infidelity somewhat understandable. The affair also risks giving opponents of same-sex marriage a chance to crow, "See, I told you so.:::1:::B
The family dynamic feasibly develops and deteriorates as it might when someone who's both a critical component, and yet a complete stranger, is introduced.:::1:::None
A nontraditional couple lives the hurts, regrets and joys of any loving family:::1:::A-
I love that this is a film about a family where being gay isn't the controversy.:::1:::8/10
[It] embraces its formulaic premise, but then resists developing in formulaic directions, resulting in one of the most refreshing and honest screen comedies of recent memory.:::1:::75/100
The Kids Are All Right is a sudsy soap opera. It's a concoction of lilac water and spermatozoa -- with lots of wine and whine.:::1:::2.5/5
Inoffensively amusing, and occasionally touching, but also a little bland.:::1:::B
Cholodenko understands that the family, any family, remains a primal source for drama that is both mirthful and maddening.:::1:::B+
Cholodenko and cowriter Stuart Blumberg have crafted a loving work about family that will resonate as true for those who find their experience reflected on the big screen and will be revelatory to others.:::1:::3.5/4
A comedy of modern manners with the texture of a great short story.:::1:::4.5/5
While firmly set in a privileged, locavorian California milieu, "The Kids Are All Right" is downright Chaucerian in its warts-and-all, roll-in-the-hay view of human behavior.:::1:::A
The subtle intelligence of this film is reflective in the title itself. By employing the words 'all right,' we are alerted to the fact that this film, however unique, addresses a sense of normalcy.:::1:::9/10
A perfect combination of fantastic writing, strong storytelling and an All-Star acting ensemble.:::1:::3.5/4
Just about everyone who has been a parent, child or partner will find resonance in its bittersweet depiction of the joys and trials of lifelong intimacy.:::1:::3/4
You can tell Cholodenko loves people, and that's why, in The Kids Are All Right, she wanted to show how funny and weird and foolish we often are.:::1:::3.5/4
Generous and warm-hearted to a fault, though as faults go, that's one of the best to have.:::1:::8/10
Emotionally raw, emotionally riveting. No Lesbian Bed Death here.:::1:::None
Cholodenko's film stands as one of the best American films of the year precisely because it's willing to look at what love truly gives, and what it truly takes.:::1:::4.5/5
If the goings-on occasionally become slim or perfunctory, the film is rescued repeatedly by an absolutely top-drawer cast.:::1:::B+
The dynamic of affection, distraction, familiarity, and frustration is deftly portrayed.:::1:::B+
Movies like The Kids Are All Right -- beautifully written, impeccably played, funny and randy and true -- don't come along very often.:::1:::4/4
The acting in this film is so good, across the board, that it doesn't feel like acting; we're simply watching a family going through some drama (and comedy) over a summer before its eldest child leaves for college.:::1:::4/4
Could very well be the pilot for a new Comedy Central series about the antics of a pair of zany lesbian mothers trying to raise their teenagers. Well, yes and no.:::1:::None
As a slice-of-life alternately affectionate and biting, the film is nothing if not naturalistic and consistently watchable.:::1:::3/4
The Kids Are All Right is a smart, cheerful, character-driven relationship comedy. In other words, it's a miracle.:::1:::4/4
Directing from the tart, laugh-out-loud script she cowrote, Lisa Cholodenko (Laurel Canyon) has crafted an honest, generous portrait of the challenges of American family life -- gay or straight.:::1:::4/4
Cholodenko's film is about family, traditional or otherwise. And you don't have to have two moms to relate.:::1:::None
[A] charming, uplifting, and very funny subversion of the traditional patriarchal family.:::1:::3.5/4
The last act makes up for a lot of the movie's earlier flaws, as Cholodenko nudges the material beyond the somewhat generic comedy of the first half into rawer, more compelling emotional territory.:::1:::3/4
The acting is close to flawless.:::1:::None
An authentic sense of soul to the couple, who struggle, fail, and love with a realism that takes Kids somewhere amazing, beyond the dull routine of broken hearts and cliched dysfunction.:::1:::B+
It would be criminal if , come Oscar time, Annette Bening and Julianne Moore are not competing for a Best Actress award.:::1:::4.5/5
A captivating, honest, unpretentious and intelligent portrait of an American family that's genuinely poignant, warm and funny. It brims with well-nuanced, brave and resonating performances.:::1:::9.16/10
...with its femme leads, [this] may be seen as a lady flick, but this is far from the case. This is for adults, male and female, who are up for a solid, family-bound story.:::1:::B
One of those small cinematic miracles that movie audiences hope and pray for. That it makes a powerful social argument in favor of LGBT families without breaking a sweat in the process is a wonderful bonus.:::1:::None
Up to the challenge, and clearly relishing roles of unusual substance, are Moore, Ruffalo and Bening -- who could well nab an Oscar nomination for her work as an iron-willed smother-mother for the ages.:::1:::3.5/5
Writing and directing a movie about family and relationships is always challenging, but Cholodenko seems to have found the right balance.:::1:::None
The bottom line is that I didn't find "The Kids Are All Right" to be particularly intriguing on any level. It seems too calculated to be taken as serious entertainment.:::0:::None
[Filled with] funny, gripping and very precise scenes played to perfection by superior actors.:::1:::A-
If you liked The Cosby Show and don't reflexively hate gay people then you're pretty much going to dig this movie because it's that show's R-rated lesbian equivalent.:::1:::3/5
The Kids Are All Right is the movie we've been waiting for all year: a comedy that doesn't take cheap shots, a drama that doesn't manipulate, a movie of ideas that doesn't preach.:::1:::None
Somewhere around the halfway mark, the realization arrives with a dull thud: Turns out that unconventional families can be just as tedious in their melodramatic dysfunctions as any traditional clan.:::0:::2/4
The director realizes she has a great actress at her disposal and gives Bening her due ... Cholodenko knows when, for greater impact, her characters should remain silent.:::1:::2/4
It's a great piece of filmmaking because of its characters, all of whom feel genuine and three-dimensional in ways that typical screenwriting fails to pull off.:::1:::None
The performances are all close to perfect, which is to say that the imperfections of each character are precisely measured and honestly presented.:::1:::4.5/5
A deft and engaging social comedy that's shaping up to be the summer movie season's savviest piece of counter-programming.:::1:::3/5
Mature, witty family dramedy explores love, parenthood.:::1:::4/5
It's a new kind of family film, smarter than most and funnier than many.:::1:::3/5
The Kids Are All Right might not be as edgy as Cholodenko's past work, but this more mainstream effort has lots of smarts, lots of heart and an open mind.:::1:::3/4
The specifics of the story only underlie its general, and universal theme: Marriages and families can be hard work -- and kind of worth it.:::1:::3.5/4
It's a brilliant screenplay, but happily, this is also Cholodenko's most visually satisfying movie.:::1:::3.5/4
The film, like its central family, succeeds as best it can under the circumstances in which it finds itself.:::1:::3/4
An all-American tale with award-level performances that is at its best when going for laughs rather than dramatic depths, where it comes disturbingly close to shifting the gears on its casual principles.:::1:::3/4
It's a movie about basic things, about the meaning of family and the vulnerability of families, with the suggestion that the ones most subject to bombardment are the families least protected by custom and tradition.:::1:::4/4
The basic joke here, and it's a rich one, is that the dynamics of gay marriages differ little from those of straight marriages. But that joke also serves as a catalyst for some startlingly beautiful considerations...:::1:::None
Kids may sound like typically quirky arthouse fare. But this is a movie for everyone -- and, in one way or another, about everyone, too.:::1:::5/5
This gem features five topnotch, multidimensional performances in one of this summer's most engaging films.:::1:::3.5/4
Expect a human comedy about relationships that haven't been fully explored on film before, told in a fashion that ensures tenderness trumps self-importance at every turn.:::1:::4.5/5
The best thing about the film is its bigheartedness. It's not out to mock these people, but rather to show how any person of any orientation can become unraveled when high-minded principles meet with base human instincts.:::1:::3.5/4
Cholodenko examines human behavior with insight and wit and has been blessed with one of the best ensemble casts of the year.:::1:::A-
[F]unny and smart and poignant and real and universal. It's one of the best movies about family I've ever seen...:::1:::None
An intimate, funny, occasionally upsetting depiction of a loving family that is, like so many families, often only just functional.:::1:::A-
Such a low-key feat of filmmaking that the scope of its offhanded generosity -- toward its characters, its story, its actors and its audience -- may not hit you until days after you've seen it.:::1:::9.5/10
Sideways, it is not, but The Kids Are All Right is, in a particularly dull summer at the movies, a friendly reminder that there are...alternatives.:::1:::4/5
Witty, urbane and thoroughly entertaining.:::1:::4/5
Plenty of movies strive for topicality, but occasionally something like The Kids Are All Right slaps you in the face with the world you're actually living in.:::1:::4/4
This isn't a movie about gay marriage; it's a movie about marriage, period, and the way complacency and resentment can undermine a relationship.:::1:::None
The movie's overrated, the performances aren't.:::1:::3/5
"All right" doesn't begin to describe it ... the easiest movie to love I've seen all year.:::1:::4/4
It's a film about marriage itself, an institution with challenges that are universal.:::1:::3.5/4
A remarkable family drama with five endearing characters whose struggles and foibles are both genuine and touching.:::1:::5/5
All right, but not great: that phrase not only describes the kids (of all ages) in this likeable family drama, but the film, as a whole, too.:::1:::None
Kids makes its own special magic. It's irresistible.:::1:::3.5/4
Cholodenko and her cast turn what could have been an utterly artificial story into a warm, funny, sharp-tongued and broiling examination of the volatility underlying even the happiest of families.:::1:::None
Cholodenko's films always falter through their obvious, self-congratulatory point-making.:::0:::None
The director alternates incident-laden storytelling with penetrating character moments that her terrific cast acts to the fullest.:::1:::3/5
Touching and funny in their upheaval, the people in The Kids Are All Right open the door to a brand new examination of family values that leaves you charged and cheering.:::1:::3/4
The Kids Are All Right is an incredibly clear-eyed look at who we are right now, and how the definition of "family" is changing, featuring a great cast, a wise and witty screenplay, and pitch-perfect direction.:::1:::None
A poignant human story deeply rooted in feelings we all can relate to even if we come from a more conventional family than this one.:::1:::9/10
The film's main strength is the screenplay, co-written by Cholodenko and Stuart Blumberg. It's perceptive and mercurial, perfectly in tune with the churning tensions within every family.:::1:::4/5
The actresses are loose and funny, trading off big scenes and clearly enjoying themselves throughout.:::1:::None
Whatever the facts of your own family life, you're likely to see some of it reflected in this wonderful movie, which you should see as soon as you can.:::1:::None
No film has left me with a fuller sense of satisfaction this year so far.:::1:::None
Annette Bening, Julianne Moore and Mark Ruffalo give award-caliber performances in this funny and poignant comedy about a lesbian couple whose teenage children seek out their biological father.:::1:::None
There are not only glancing moments but whole sequences in this movie when the agony of social embarrassment makes you want to haul the characters to their feet and slap them in the chops.:::0:::None
The title, like Nicole Holofcener's Please Give, is one that trails you out of the theater and gives you something to brood on.:::1:::None
Lisa Cholodenko is one of the more radical visionaries working in American indie cinema today.:::1:::3/4
Cholodenko's third feature is not great (it's too broad), but the film is enjoyable, well-acted, timely and relevant in ways that most American comedies are not: It says something about the new family structures and values.:::1:::B+
Guided by an outstanding script, everyone is able to go deep into her or his character. Particular huzzahs are due Bening for the precision she brings to the brusque yet emotionally expressive Nic.:::1:::A
Touchingly and amusingly treats the last summer home before college as just as fraught for families who have two moms and a sperm donor as any other, just more complicated.:::1:::7/10
The mid-life parenting crisis of a lesbian couple (awesomely played by Julianne Moore and Annette Bening) is the narrative cornerstone for a memorable comedic family drama from writer/director Lisa Cholodenko.:::1:::B+
Despite its script's considerable shortcomings, (the film) is a timely, engaging story that provides the sublime pleasure of watching two lovely, exceptional actresses in great form.:::1:::B-
There's considerable originality in a story centering on a sperm donor whose identity and visits upend a household.:::1:::B+
A glibly intelligent yet unconventional feel-good film, it grapples with commitment issues inherent in long-term relationships.:::1:::8/10
What we have is an amiable character portrait that is enjoyable at times, but for me, difficult to get emotionally invested in.:::0:::None
How much you like Life As We Know It greatly depends on your tolerance of Katherine Heigl.:::0:::2.5/5
Josh Duhamel props up Heigl and makes this wildly uneven comedy her best rom-com since "Knocked Up.":::1:::2.5/4
Sure, we know where the story is headed but a few funny scenes and the chemistry between the two leads make this a solid date movie.:::1:::3.0/5
while there is some chemistry between [the leads], it's wasted as the shambolic plot gives them nowhere to go.:::0:::2/5
Life As We Know It is Studio Filmmaking As We Fear It.:::0:::None
A half-decent, half-trite, mostly mediocre bowl of mushy strained baby food.:::0:::2.5/5
If you have a taste for poop and projectile-vomit jokes, you'll find some chuckles ... but don't go out of your way to hire a babysitter.:::0:::None
The core idea of the film is as off-putting as the way in which the premise is depicted.:::0:::C-
It does nothing new, offers nothing new, attempts nothing new, a formula picture from beginning to end.:::0:::4/10
Genuinely heartfelt and surprisingly effective in the departments of both laughs and tears, and represents an uptick in the notably declining career of star Katherine Heigl.:::1:::B+
full review at Movies for the Masses:::0:::2/5
As cheerily banal and smilingly forgettable as its slice-of-life comic-strip title. Should really be called Bringing Up Baby in Bourgeois-Land. This isn't a realistic, romantic, or comic family anyone should give a baby-poop about.:::0:::None
The only reason I gave this two stars is because director Greg Berlanti has a knack for directing a bevy of babies.:::0:::2/4
The film should end a half-hour earlier than it does, but I guess we needed another film in which someone brings their disruptive kid to work or another scene where a desperate lover rushes through an airport.:::0:::C-
In lieu of any real humour, we are subjected to a parade of tired spew-and-poo baby jokes and the age-old odd couple scenario, which Heigl and Duhamel admittedly handle nicely despite a flat script.:::0:::2/5
Every now and then a movie that promises to be an absolute car wreck, actually isn't.:::1:::4/5
There are way too many nappy and baby spit jokes and not much more. The novice parent has been a cinema staple for years, but this one is lame. It makes Kindergarten Cop seem profound.:::0:::None
The two leads are attractive but I'm constantly irritated by the characters that Heigl takes on, they are not unintelligent but they're stupid.:::0:::3/5
This brisk, completely predictable confection does have one worthwhile nod to realism: Sophie takes in The Wiggles, The Wonder Pets and has Leonardo the Terrible Monster in her library. That rings true in a way Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel never will.:::0:::2/5
Despite the film's initial overloading of suburban stereotypes, the easy gags about promiscuity, baby vomit and nappy changing gradually give way to a pretty decent, if strictly formulaic, yarn about commitment and unexpected life changes.:::1:::2.5/5
The whole thing just gets by as a crowd-pleaser, mainly due to the work of Duhamel, who does have enough charm to make the appalling appealing.:::0:::2/5
Pure Hollywood corn, saccharine and sour by turns.:::0:::None
This is the first produced script from the writers and they find more flexibility in this story than I expected. There is space for depth, drama and real life.:::1:::3/5
Life an unexpected delight.:::1:::3.0/4.0
Never deviates from the romantic comedy guidebook. It delivers exactly what you would expect, and nothing further; tears, laughter, romance, and plenty of cute baby moments, awkwardly wrapped in a tragic situation.:::0:::None
Even if the film isn't worth recommending, it's not nearly as bad as it deserves to be.:::0:::2/2
It would take a much better director than Greg Berlanti to animate this corpse ...:::0:::1/5
In yet another twist on the relationship and baby happiness formula, this predictable and formulaic Hollywood rom com chick flick has some fun moments, despite its occasionally cloying storyline based in the plastic never-land of fake reality:::1:::None
Life As We Know It could be one of Holly's bakery confections; a festival of quirk around the edges and a hole in the middle.:::0:::2/4
Imagine if Josh Brolin and Josh Hartnett joined these two on screen. It would be a virtual Josh-a-thon.:::1:::3/4
Certainly the story is contrived in places and the tone only just manages to resurface after an early plunge, but if you're willing to go along with it and get involved, you'd have to have a heart of stone not to be at least a little charmed.:::1:::3/5
It's easy to become cynical about a certain brand of funny-sad familial comedies like Life as We Know It.:::0:::2/4
When the entire movie is predictable, cliched, and routine, what's the point in going out to see it? Hint: there is none.:::0:::2/4
May please romantic comedy fans but Heigl and the plot are downers; Duhamel escapes with his career intact.:::0:::5/10
We keep seeing Heigl's potential as a fine comic actress and, the curse of optimism, continue to be disappointed when she betrays her best instincts.:::0:::None
It's not as bad as it sounds. It's much worse.:::0:::1/5
As "meet-cute" scenarios go, it's one of the more sick and twisted ones out there, not least because it takes all of 30 seconds for the film to forget about Holly and Messer's grief and embrace the hilarity of poop-filled nappy montages.:::0:::1/5
A bland, overlong, unfunny and forgettable romantic comedy that appeals to the lowest common denominator.:::0:::4.827/10
I truly loathed just about every second of Life as We Know It.:::0:::2/10
It bravely explores untapped comedy wells such as how kids are expensive, how men hate changing nappies, and how single women fancy single men with babies.:::0:::2/5
The real surprise is how this done-to-death love story hooks you and keeps you riveted until the Hollywood happy-ending melts the whole thing down.:::1:::3.5/5
Shallow yet sweetly sentimental, it's a mildly amusing date movie...not exactly fresh yet not completely rotten.:::1:::6/10
The title becomes a depressingly self-fulfilling prophecy: This is movie life as we have all come to know it.:::0:::2.5/4
Sporadically watchable yet utterly disposable...:::0:::2/4
A potentially touching drama compromised by rom-com routine and defined by the type of sparks that rocks give off when clashed together often enough.:::0:::None
It's not that baby comedies aren't a legitimate popcorn genre. But by comparison, this sleepwalk through pre-fab family-life makes Look Who's Talking and Three Men and a Baby look like art.:::0:::1/5
Watching Duhamel and Heigl discover the joys and pains of parenthood is cute as far as it goes, but their story can't progress too far until the kid is out of diapers.:::0:::2/4
The movie pulls at your heart strings and takes some unexpected detours before arriving at a happy ending. This harmless, inoffensive movie is like junk food that provides a wellspring of comfort and warmth. Newlyweds planning a family will get a...:::1:::2.5/4
Note to Hollywood: If a movie like Life As We Know It needs diaper gags to make us laugh, you're in trouble.:::0:::2/4
Only intermittently irritating (especially the opening ten minutes), this star vehicle for Katherine Heigl eventually, with some solid emotional battering, warmed up the cockles of my heart.:::1:::6/10
It aims for comfort food, but ends up with leftovers.:::0:::C
Yes, there are some twists, a nice comedic turn or two, but the inevitable hook-up of dueling opposites is never anything but inevitable.:::0:::2.5/4
I'm a sucker for babies, puppies and hot men. "Life as We Know It" has two out of three, so what more can a girl ask for?:::1:::None
My pet peeve about comedy trailers comes into play when they reveal all the best lines or situations, so there's virtually nothing left when the full length feature comes around. Such is the case here.:::0:::None
As disposable as one of those diapers.:::0:::C+
The plot goes through motions that will be tiresomely familiar to anyone who saw Baby Boom, Three Men And A Baby, Raising Waylon or dozens of other movies about unplanned parenthood.:::0:::1/5
If you thought things could only get better following Killers and The Ugly Truth, you're in for a nasty surprise.:::0:::2/5
Sweet but not sappy, knowing but not cynical and familiar enough to satisfy but different enough to keep us on our toes.:::1:::2.5/4
It's all a bit pat, but it's cute, especially considering the state of the genre.:::1:::C+
Predictable romcom explores mature aspects of parenting.:::1:::3/5
Peculiarly ruthless, it kills off a perfectly nice set of parents and orphans an adorable infant so the dead couple's best friends can find love; this blood sacrifice seems like a pretty extreme set-up for a couple of hours of sitcom cuteness...:::0:::2/4
It?s not terrible. Indeed, it?s actually alright. It?s a note of hope that, just maybe, Heigl and Duhamel?s careers won?t be defined by their work of the past 3 or 4 years:::1:::None
While set-ups for rom-coms are usually all too predictable, this one's never been done before. Inventive? Sort of. Believable? Not on your life. A shame, since the delightful leads deserved better.:::0:::5.5/10
"Life As We Know It" is not one of the best rom-coms out there, but it will suffice for a couple hour escape giving you a few laughs along the way.:::1:::3/5
[P]retends to be something hip and fresh and is in fact relentlessly conventional, even retrograde... American, land of the meanspirited romantic comedy!:::0:::None
Thanks to smart casting and sharp direction this story of a mismatched pair thrown together to parent an orphaned baby is really quite funny and heartfelt.:::1:::3.5/5
If innocuous entertainment, amiable enough while it lasts but forgettable beyond, has a place in life as you know it, then Life As We Know It will have a place in your heart.:::1:::3/4
There is not a single deviation from formula.:::0:::1.5/5
Cloying and at times annoying, Life as We Know It is egregiously manipulative, whoring itself out for a few unearned tears.:::0:::1.5/4
Cue baby-based farce and all the romcom cliches you can eat.:::0:::1.5/5
"Life", in this context, is pushing it. How about instead "desperate contrivance that unites two people who thought they hated each other"?:::0:::1/5
This is just a waste of time.:::0:::1/4
Life As We Know It is life as we've seen it in movies too many times before.:::0:::D
Just like the clunker you end up buying and liking in spite of everything, Life As We Know It gets you there. Exactly where is hard to say, but chances are you won't regret making the journey.:::1:::2.5/4
Basically, this is The Taming of the Shrew with an adorable-baby twist that never occurred to William Shakespeare.:::0:::2/4
Whose life are we talking about, exactly?:::0:::1/4
There's clearly no reason to watch this movie, and I'm not suggesting you should. I was just glad it didn't make geysers of blood spurt from my ears, that's all.:::0:::C
The movie?s efforts to add gravity to its lightweight genre via depictions of grief and parenting doubts come off as glib and disingenuous.:::0:::2/5
A romance flares up, and even the jokes, already sluggish, seem to reach even further toward the obsolete.:::0:::2/4
Life As We Know It avoids most of the romantic comedy traps.:::1:::B
It's not horrible, it's just so formulaic and predictable, and has a hard time juggling the comedy, romance, tragedy and general drama that it ends up being only a bit more enjoyable than spending time with a cranky baby. (Parental Review also Available):::0:::None
It's enough to make me give up on Heigl.:::0:::2/5
This is crap as we know it, a 113 minute package of romcom suck.:::0:::.5/4
Goo goo gag gag.:::0:::C-
Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel have an appealing chemistry, but Life as We Know It is tripped up by awkwardly fusing a familiar sitcom scenario with a tragic premise.:::0:::2.5/4

Life As We Know it is Ok, its a chick flick...Its a Katherine Heigl Movie...:::1:::3/5
In case you haven't seen Katherine Heigl play uptight, quirky and terminally single often enough, another chance awaits in Greg Berlanti's awkward slapstick/melodrama mash-up.:::0:::2/5
I didn't laugh once at any of this trite, sentimental gunk...:::0:::1.5/5
Duhamel hits that sweet spot between eye candy and everydude as well as any actor working today, and his easy charm rubs off on Heigl.:::1:::3/5
Should really be called 'Life As Formulaic Movies Show It'...nothing more than a second-rate sitcom stretched to unconscionable length by, among other devices, probably the largest number of musical montages in...history.:::0:::D+
With pratfalls and teardrops, the film swings from sitcom to sit-dram.:::0:::2/4
If Stephen King wrote a romantic comedy, this would be it.:::0:::C
Greg Berlanti's second film is more drama than romantic comedy -- and a good drama at that. The plot's not the only thing that offers something unexpected.:::1:::None
What you may not expect is quite how satisfying much of the film is, with Duhamel turning out to be a very good sparring partner for Heigl, whose lush, soft exterior conceals a very spiky interior that tends to wilt her co-stars.:::1:::3/5
In years to come, Life as We Know It may be used as a prime example of "mediocre" in Merriam-Webster's updated dictionary.:::0:::2/4
Formulaic, shallow and sinfully tedious from start to finish.:::0:::1/5
The two leads have screen appeal, but the chemistry between them is thin, while the story wavers between hackneyed cliches and incredibility...:::0:::2/5
A title as perfunctory as the film it adorns -- perfunctory and bland.:::0:::2.5/5
What a horrible premise for a romantic comedy.:::0:::2/5
The premise is the most interesting thing about it. From there, it's just bland.:::0:::2/4
It's brisk, pleasantly acted, painless. These days, that's high praise.:::1:::None
Veers not an inch off Hollywood's well-worn rom-com path.:::0:::2/5
The supporting cast serves up enough small moments of surprise to keep this formula flick from falling flat.:::1:::3/5

Pity any poor kid stuck in a house like that. Pity, too, anyone who has to stop by for a visit.:::0:::C-
The Heigl/Duhamel hostilities are so persuasive their entire movie balls itself up into a shrill domestic nightmare.:::0:::1/5
This exercise in cynical formulaic movie construction is best avoided, unless insomnia's been a problem.:::0:::1/4
Life as We Know It turns into a reasonably honest consideration of what it might mean to have to honor the dead by raising their living, breathing, pooping, screaming progeny.:::1:::3/4
Credulity is stretched throughout.:::0:::None
The actors are fully invested in the charade, even if the movie that surrounds them is not.:::0:::2/5
A sweet and warm comedy that always brings its focus back to the laughs even when dealing with very real and serious relationship issues.:::1:::7.5/10
100 minutes of dirty-diaper gags, baby puke, unfunny squabbling, and the inevitable denouement.:::0:::1.5/4
This is a change from what audiences have come to expect from the usual Heigl vehicle. She's quicker-witted and warmer than usual here, and she keeps Duhamel on his toes, even when the storyline drags its feet.:::1:::2.5/4
You can?t open a diaper and expect a diamond.:::0:::1/5
Sometimes I suspect there is secret high-stakes contest in Hollywood among filmmakers to try and come up with a movie without a single original idea. If so, Life As We Know It is a contender...:::0:::1.5/4
So anyway, what happens in Life As We Know It? You'll never guess in a million years. Never.:::0:::1.5/4
I nearly sobbed at the funeral scene, sullen in the knowledge that I?d spend the next 90-plus minutes watching a painfully forced romance emerge.:::0:::2/4
Funnier and darker than you might expect, ahow to fly.:::1:::B
"How to Train Your Dragon 2" doesn't play it safe, and that's why it's the rare sequel that doesn't feel somewhat stale.:::1:::3/4
How to Train Your Dragon 2 does what most sequels can't -- that is, it expands on the original while maintaining the core elements of what made the first film so great.:::1:::9.5/10
It seemed as if there was nowhere new to go after the first film, but this is a richer story that dares to go darker and is thus more rewarding.:::1:::4/5
OK, but the thin charms of the original are a little thinner this time out.:::1:::2.5/4
Writer/director Dean DeBlois has created a powerful, exciting and touching film that proves animation can challenge the summer's big-ticket live-action movies, just as Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King did 20 years ago.:::1:::None
It's good enough to have these wonderful characters back on the screen, but the production has managed to renew purpose and construct fresh objectives without tarnishing the blinding spirit of the original movie.:::1:::A
How to Train Your Dragon 2 is an exciting adventure with rousing animated action, but it lacks the emotional hook of its predecessor.:::1:::6/10
DeBlois keeps the story moving efficiently enough, and despite the fact that the film has too many structural arms and legs wiggle-wagging in all the wrong places, there are some finely tuned dramatic moments ...:::1:::None
It has the core of a genuine crowd-pleaser, but unfortunately something bigger and more all-consuming keeps getting into its head.:::0:::2/4
The storybook images are often so amazing that I feel ungrateful noting that I wish the story was equally wondrous.:::1:::None
Not all the heart-swelling flying sequences in the world can flap away the sensation of franchise fatigue here.:::1:::3/5
Heartfelt, funny, and captivating, this is a satisfying continuation of the first film.:::1:::9/10
You may experience that rare sense of wonder that comes from losing yourself in a proper, well told story.:::1:::9/10
DeBlois' powers haven't diminished ... he dares to go deeper, smarter and even darker, honing in on the elements that made the first film work.:::1:::4/5
This 'toon doesn't lack heart amid all the high-flying antics, but it may have benefited from a heartier dose of imagination.:::1:::None
When the film flies, it soars.:::1:::3/5
...few fans of the original are likely to be truly disappointed, and the film is certainly in the top tier of the studio's output. It's just a shame that it doesn't quite have the same beating heart as its predecessor.:::1:::B-
... this is how franchises are supposed to work.:::1:::A
Going beyond the pat eco-conscious message that every kids' film has to have, HTTYD2 touches on how complex the emotional bond between a person and an animal can be.:::1:::None
This smartly paced sequel does a great job of drawing out the lead characters, expanding the world they exist in and adding in some warm hearted and moving moments.:::1:::None
This DreamWorks Animation sequel advances the story without sacrificing the integrity that defined its most atypical toon.:::1:::None
The real nightmare is the tragic lack of creativity in this new look of one of the genre's greatest characters.:::0:::3/10
I still like the characters from the first film, and these kids were cardboard shadows of them.:::0:::2.5/5
This Elm Street reeks of a rushed cash-grab, as even the most reliable of cliched shocks fail to register on the fright-o-meter.:::0:::1/5
This flimsy remake is a nightmare and unworthy of your time.:::0:::1.0/5
Many people have already made the mistake of holding this film up to the original, expecting it to be just as good, but it just isn't. However, taken on its own, it's still an entertaining horror film and an interesting take on the material.:::1:::3/4
An homage to Craven's vision that is believably earnest in execution and completely faithful in spirit.:::1:::3/4
Mara and Gallner make an attractive couple on the lam and Haley, as Freddy Krueger, hams it up to an almost alarming degree.:::1:::3/5
Haley offers a darker, meaner take on the iconic character.:::0:::C
I did jump a few times, and I liked Haley's dour malevolence, but overall, the new Nightmare on Elm Street is a by-the-numbers bad dream.:::1:::B-
There's really no reason to see this dreadful picture; better to rent the 1984 feature.:::0:::D
Freddy's back -- and he's slicker and more sinister than ever.:::1:::B
For fans of the Nightmare franchise, and slasher films in general, the new version does exactly what you want and not much more.:::0:::5/10
This is even less inspired and imaginative than the Friday The 13th reboot and makes Rob Zombie's Halloween films feel like the work of an auteur.:::0:::0.5/5
For a film about the dangers of falling asleep it tried damn hard to make the audience nod off.:::0:::2/5
Like many horror fans, I approached viewing the recent remake of the post-slasher classic with extremely low expectations. Not low enough, though!:::0:::1/10
...it has nothing new to say and works with an original that didn't need remaking.:::0:::4/10
Ultimately, the remake plays out more like the parade of increasingly daft sequels that milked the last drop of blood out of the Krueger franchise.:::0:::None

Haley just ain't no Englund, no matter how much he tries.:::1:::3/5
In this outing, however, Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer's screenplay pulls no punches about Freddy's vicious sadism and paedophilia and, seriously, there's no fun in that.:::0:::1.5/5

An expectedly worthless horror-movie remake from Michael Bay's production company...:::0:::1.5/4
Compared to the flamboyance of Robert Englund in the 1980s, Jackie Earle Haley as the crazed Freddy Krueger is more lumbering man-child than demonic daddy.:::0:::2.5/5
This trip to Elm Street will give you nightmares, but not the kind they anticipated.:::0:::None
This is the worst yet from Michael Bay's horror production company Platinum Dunes, which also brought you rubbish re-makes of Halloween and Friday the 13th.:::0:::1/5
Only a NIGHTMARE for fans of the franchise.:::0:::3/10
Is there any movie franchise that cries out less for revisiting than A Nightmare on Elm Street?:::0:::2/5
It's not a good film, but if you're feeling jaded and just want to watch a demonic killer pound his fist through the chest of some hapless, cardboard teenager, then this might just scratch that itch.:::0:::2/5
Do not, let me repeat that, DO NOT, watch the new A Nightmare on Elm Street.:::0:::1/5
After giving a great performance in "Watchmen," what was Jackie Earle Haley doing in this film, besides making a buck or two? Extremely disappointing remake and creepier than the original, but not in a good way. Paul Chambers, CNN.:::0:::D
It's the Bay touch you feel in the way actors register as body count, characters go undeveloped, and sensation trumps feeling. A nightmare, indeed.:::0:::1.5/4
its primary effect is to leave you less thrilled than simply asking what's the point in remaking something if you can't improve on the original?:::0:::2/4
To call the film patterned to fit would be a blazing understatement.:::0:::2/5
A recurring Nightmare.:::0:::2.0/4.0
A bland, unncessary return to Freddyland:::0:::None
It's all efficiently done and gory but director Samuel Bayer adds so little to the old familiar scare story that you wonder why they didn't just save a bob or two and reissue the Robert Englund original.:::0:::2/5
Though no worse than the raft of terrible Elm Street sequels, this remake misses some of the surreal and anarchic low-budget energy Craven brought to his film (not to mention Johnny Depp).:::0:::2/5
The nightmare on Elm Street is not how scary (or not) the film is, but how it destroys the franchise.:::0:::1/4
Photocopies much of Wes Craven's original 1984 classic, but makes senseless changes that destroy the story's night-terror integrity.:::0:::1/5
A film that shows they're not even attempting creativity because with horror fans lowering their standards more and more, why should they even try?:::0:::None
Caso existisse, Freddy Krueger poderia usar este filme como um otimo recurso para levar suas vitimas ao sono.:::0:::1/5
The bottom line is that it isn't just Elm Street that's affected; you'll find a nightmare on any street that's housing a theater with the misfortune to be playing this monstrosity.:::0:::1/4
We watch a bunch of twentysomething catalog-model types with last names for first names impersonate high schoolers who keep getting slashed up in their dreams.:::0:::2/5
The idea that repressed or concealed knowledge of child abuse can emerge years later to traumatize victims and family members has rarely had more currency, but this slack remake is neither persuasive nor scary.:::0:::1.5/4
Does it matter that the plot is little more than a cynical, machine-tooled retread of the 1984 original? Debut director Samuel Bayer was not hired to dismantle the franchise but to shoot it afresh.:::1:::3/5
Complete lack of imagination.:::1:::1/5
Unadventurous, devoid of personality and completely lacking any semblance of imagination, Samuel Bayer's new Nightmare is a textbook exercise straight out of generic horror remakes 101.:::0:::2/5
As the various teenagers fight to stay awake, you may find yourself doing exactly the same.:::0:::None
He's survived six sequels, a grudge match with Jason Voorhees and a terrible TV spin-off, but this remake may finally finish Freddy Krueger once and for all.:::0:::1/5
Freddy Kruger deserves better and so do we.:::0:::1/4
Where the original was joltingly inventive and disturbing, this is just second-hand fright.:::0:::2/5
The real problem with A Nightmare on Elm Street 2010 is: it's really unbelievably dull.:::0:::1.5/5
This is the worst yet from Michael Bay's horror production company Platinum Dunes, which also brought you rubbish re-makes of Halloween and Friday the 13th.:::0:::1/5
While Haley makes for a decent Freddy, other members of the cast kill the party.:::0:::2/5
The remake of A Nightmare On Elm Street only serves to tarnish the legacy of the original franchise, substituting any creative flair with bogstandard writing and direction.:::0:::1/5
Surely the point of any remake is to find something new in the material that brings it to a new audience. But all these filmmakers have done is rehash the groundbreaking original into another lifeless, cliche-filled slog.:::0:::1.5/5
It's well-made and rattles along at a fair old pace, predictably leaving the way open for another 130-odd deaths in the inevitable glut of sequels.:::1:::3/5
Whereas Wes Craven's '84 original kept you unsure as to whether you were witnessing dreams or reality, director Samuel Bayer's remake color-codes the transitions. How helpful!:::0:::1/4
Bayer's Nightmare is 95 minutes of non-stop crap dialogue, crapper acting and the crappest expositional nonsense I've seen since The Lovely Bones.:::0:::3/10
Eye-glazingly pointless and totally underwhelming.:::0:::1.5/5
As pointless remakes go, this is by no means the worst of them, thanks to a decent cast and a liberal use of shock and gore, though the 2010 Freddy is significantly less scary than the original.:::1:::3/5
Jackie Earle Haley's Krueger is a blast, but the child-molester twist is more depressingly clinical than dream-logic harrowing.:::0:::2/5
Let's start by naming a few things scarier than the new "A Nightmare on Elm Street" %u2013 golden retriever puppies, rainbows, chocolate chip cookies, "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," and flower gardens.:::0:::F
At least they gave Freddy a back story - that's a good thing. That it made no sense - that's a bad thing.:::0:::4/10
Haley does what's required of him--which mainly consists of growling and grimacing beneath layers of make up--but there's nothing at all memorable about his performance:::0:::1.5/4
The remake is a better movie than most of the later entries in the powerhouse franchise, but it's not a patch on Wes Craven's 1984 original.:::0:::None
Memo to Freddy: How can we miss you if you won't stay away?:::0:::None
What we are left with is a higher body count and a faster pace, but no tension. ...Welcome to the low-impact world of modern franchise horror pictures.:::0:::1.5/4
The set pieces are well created and Jackie Earle Haley does a fine job (don't forget, he's not only dealing with the character but with the knowledge that Robert Englund will always be associated with the role).:::1:::2/4
Drab leads and a lack of any sort of fevered investigative pop make this Nightmare come across like a boring, gory junior detective procedural.:::0:::C-
The vintage teen-scream thrills, once so fresh, now seem stale.:::0:::1/5
Somewhere, Wes Craven is laughing up his sleeve, and Robert Englund is grinning. It's nice to know that you're irreplaceable.:::0:::1.5/4
Never has the lure of the recognizable been more obvious than in this familiar yet forgettable reboot of Wes Craven's 1980s horror franchise.:::0:::4/10
The movie takes itself way too seriously, like a Medieval Times waiter acting scared of a cell phone.:::0:::1/4
Nice try, but they probably should have just left the original Nightmare on Elm Street as is.:::0:::1.5/4
When producers Michael Bay, Andrew Form and Bradley Fuller go to sleep tonight, it's a safe bet that their dreams will be tormented by Wes Craven and Robert Englund sporting gloves with bladed fingers.:::0:::1/5
Haley is a solid replacement for Englund as the murderous Freddy. He is particularly effective in the scenes of Freddy's earlier life. Although his talent was put to better use in "Watchmen" this role should give him employment for years to come.:::0:::1.75/4
Save yourself the ticket price and buy the original on DVD and see what a true fright is.:::0:::2/5
Those who are old enough to have fond memories of the original are probably too old for this Nightmare.:::1:::3/5
This is what happens when Gossip Girl has a character with a blemish problem and a stripe-savvy fashion sense:::0:::D
No, it isn't necessary. But in this remake, Jackie Earle Haley does a nice job as our favorite knife-fingered terror in "A Nightmare on Elm Street.":::0:::2.5/4
We all know Freddy Krueger (whether we've seen this franchise or not) so we're miles ahead of these static teenage characters, and just waited for them to catch up.:::0:::4/10
On film or DVD, Freddy is terrifying for about 15 minutes %u2014 one reel tops. After the first couple of appearances and a kill or two, he is ho-hum.:::0:::2/5
Scarred by bad makeup, subpar acting and overall inept storytelling, A Nightmare on Elm Street is a bad dream for fans of the original 1984 movie or anyone who enjoys well made horror films.:::0:::2/5
It doesn't get any worser than this.:::0:::0/4
Entirely devoid of personality, music video director Samuel Bayer is unable to handle the flow of a feature film, stuttering from dream sequence to dream sequence without cohesion.:::0:::2/5
Freddy's back, in all his gory glory, but revisiting him...is less likely to inspire an attack of night terrors than to elicit a bored yawn, followed by a restful sleep...:::0:::None
...an unintelligible mess, as if this remake of the slasher-genre favorite is its own dismembered victim.:::0:::D
Mindlessly entertaining, slick and stylishly creepy albeit deficient in real surprises and visceral scares. It's a cut above the recent slew of horror remakes.:::1:::6.75/10
The Nightmare on Elm Street reboot has more in common with the later, lame-o sequels than with the one it is technically remaking.:::0:::1.5/4
Incredibly bland and unimaginative. It's slow, tedious, and kind of pretentious. Fails to answer the existential question - why do I exist?:::0:::C-
If not for its title, and the memories it conjures up... the film wouldn't have enough of an impact to last through the end of the credits.:::0:::4/10
a Nightmare just like the ones we've seen before, which is probably why it feels more tiresome than terrifying.:::0:::2/5
To summarize this angry rant: boring, cliche, too serious and a waste of an icon.:::0:::None
Jackie Earle Haley is an excellent successor to the original's Robert Englund. Freddy Krueger isn't just scary again, he's the most disturbing he's ever been.:::1:::3/5
In six months' time, no one will remember this movie. When it's shuffled off to DVD, most of the copies will end up in a landfill.:::0:::2/5
Haley's Krueger doesn't just look like a deeply unhinged burn victim out for gruesome revenge, he is a complete embodiment of evil. And it's terrifying.:::1:::None
This is just Nightmare 9 and you can believe this is the real backstory they never told you before, not that nonsense about the three flying heads.:::1:::None
A Nightmare on Elm Street is a movie about people trying not to doze off. Having just watched it, I know how they feel.:::0:::D
Samuel Bayer's remake of Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street may be about repressed memories coming back in horrific ways, but it ironically ends up one of the least memorable films of 2010 to date.:::0:::None
You'd think Jackie Earle Haley as pedophile Freddy would kill. Oh, hardly.:::0:::C-
So generic, so lazy, and so forgettable they may as well have "we're not even trying" plastered across the bottom of the screen.:::0:::1.5/5
Dream killer Freddy Krueger made a generation of moviegoers scared to fall asleep. Too bad his return to the big screen is such a snooze.:::0:::1.5/4
Look at it this way: At least you won't fall asleep.:::0:::2.5/5
Where Craven's film was campy, Bayer's movie is just plain dark.:::1:::B-
The result of the new Nightmare is, at best, a kind of stand-off between predictability and competent execution.:::0:::2/4
Far more disturbing than entertaining.:::0:::2/5
While it's visually appealing, the new Elm Street fails to sustain momentum or create much genuine tension.:::0:::5/10
A Nightmare on Elm Street may be the most unneeded movie of the year. And that's saying something.:::0:::None
Traffics in overly familiar scare tactics, setting up predictable false alarms and telegraphing in advance just when Freddy will pop into the frame and utter one of his labored witticisms.:::0:::2.5/5
The jump scares, given a little extra oomph by the ever-looming possibility of a double wake-up, do what they're supposed to do. They make you jump.:::1:::3/5
By focusing on the monster instead of teen iniquities and daring to move past innuendo into fact, this Nightmare surpasses its predecessors to out-menace them all.:::1:::4.0/4.0
Simply put, it's not very scary, and its efforts to do right by the material forget the most basic reason for going to see films like this.:::0:::C
This would-be franchise reboot seems haunted by its reliance on genre conventions.:::0:::None
The film does have positives including a strong performance from Jackie Earle Haley but ultimately fails in delivering tension and scares.:::0:::2.5/5
The production isn't nearly as creepy as the original and the new invention of Freddy's secret cave is an opportunity for psychological horror squandered.:::0:::C-
All we can think of is how much we miss the Robert Englund Freddy. Man, that guy knew how to have a killer good time.:::0:::0.5/4
To the audience suckered into paying to see this, here's why your generation sucks.:::0:::1/4
New Freddy, no new scares in this tepid reboot of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise.:::0:::1.5/4
The not-very new Nightmare is indebted to the illogic of dreams, but determinedly dumb about using it.:::0:::None
This moody, lifeless movie rips off lines, scenes, dream sequences and character kills from Craven's film ... while draining them of energy, suspense and meaning.:::0:::None
People have dreams and either get their guts ripped out or don't get their gets ripped out. And then, after 90 or so minutes are used up, the movie finds some weak pretext for ending.:::0:::2/4
Lacks imagination, story, good acting and a reason for being.:::0:::0/4
The new Nightmare is a straight, shiny, honorable remake.:::1:::None
There are a lot of things wrong with this remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street, not least of which is that it was made at all.:::0:::1.5/4
The A Nightmare on Elm Street remake is intelligent, well-acted and great-looking. But if you want to be scared, you're out of luck.:::1:::2.5/4
The remake has dumbed-down its source to a genre it always transcended: the slice-and-dice, snip-and-quip gore film.:::0:::2/4
Thanks to the film's re-imagining of Freddy as accused child molester, an uncomfortable veneer of ickiness looms that makes it hard to truly enjoy...:::0:::2.5/5
The basic feeling you get out of this thing is 'been there-done that'.:::0:::2/5
One dreary jump scare after another, without a moment to breathe, show something revealing about one of its doomed teens, or deliver a single line of dialogue that isn't dully and directly on-point.:::0:::D-
As is the case with most remakes, this one is pretty pointless.:::0:::1.5/4
Ol' Cusinart Hand is back in A Nightmare on Elm Street, a pointless, unimaginative "re-imagining" of Wes Craven's cleverly conceived slasher movie.:::0:::1.5/4
For all his calculated bumps in the night and shots of creepy-looking preschoolers moping around a boiler room, Bayer misses the little things that made the original so hard to forget. Craven was right to keep his distance from this one.:::0:::2/4
After the incompetence exuded by Samuel Bayer here, I feel confident in saying it is time to put his feature film career to sleep for good.:::0:::0/4
The bastard film of 100 idiots.:::0:::1/5
Parental Content Review:::0:::None
Fails to mimic or update with any competence.:::0:::C-
ANOES doesn't reinvent the wheel, but there's a solid story with striking death scenes, and that should please the more pragmatic fans on both sides of the demographic.:::1:::None
Welcome to 2010, Freddy Krueger. You were scarier in 1984.:::0:::2/4
It's the moments when Bayer goes off-book that are most effective, using modern special effects to augment the dreams in ways that weren't possibly back in the day, on a budget.:::1:::B+
Perfectly symbolic of the laziness and lack of ingenuity inherent with much of today's plastic Hollywood moviemaking.:::0:::2/4
Haley's a fine actor, but he was far scarier in the suburban drama Little Children. And Englund's unpredictable presence is definitely missed.:::0:::1/5
As an exercise in "re-imagining," to use Hollywood's favorite rehash euphemism, this Nightmare is mostly stale goods.:::0:::2/5
Like a cover band with more stagecraft than talent, A Nightmare on Elm Street looks good recycling "greatest hits" moments but fails to capture the excitement of the original.:::0:::1.5/4
This new Nightmare is almost completely redundant, but Freddy's blades remain sharp enough to guarantee Haley's job security for at least a few years.:::0:::2.5/4
2010's Nightmare isn't just flawed, but without any merit whatsoever, amongst the worst of Platinum Dunes' cinematic abortions and as bad, if not worse, than Freddy's Revenge and Freddy's Dead.:::0:::1/10
If there's anything new to be added, the new Nightmare does not do it.:::0:::D
The so-called "re-imagining" of A Nightmare on Elm Street isn't a nightmare so much as it is a series of missed opportunities.:::0:::2/4
Never quite answers the most essential question for any remake: Is this really necessary?:::0:::2.5/5
Stylish remake isn't as good as the original, but it has enough genuine scares to merit a mild recommendation.lthough the tone fluctuates wildly enough to seriously disorientate.:::1:::3/5
You could write this one in your sleep.:::0:::2/5
An utterly predictable romantic comedy about Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel having to cope with a newly-orphaned baby.:::1:::3/5
Heigl and Duhamel hit the mark and strike up an easy rapport, making them a pleasant enough pair to spend two hours with. Don't expect the film to leave a lasting impression, though, it's as shallow as they come.:::0:::2/5
Cute boy and girl opposites meet and fall in love after their best friends die and leave them in charge of raising their orphaned daughter. Adorable.:::0:::None
Heigl's always watchable and it's a pleasantly undemanding effort even if it's premise is worryingly close to the 2004 TV film Raising Waylon.:::1:::3/5
The film stacks the odds of the audience caring about Heigl and Duhamel against a narrative vacuum that favors eye candy and cheap effect over emotional logic.:::0:::6/10
Its familiar story passes with nothing to distinguish itself from the many other similarly plotted movies and sitcoms.:::0:::None
Baby love begets grown-up love in this formulaic but intermittently charming rom-com about mismatched careerists whose best-laid plans are abruptly derailed by an orphaned infant.:::0:::None
A snappy and funny performance by Katherine Heigl is the best reason to see this romantic comedy:::1:::3/5
Aspiring to combine comedy, tragedy, and romance into a deep-meaning treatise on the prettiest and happiest white people you've ever seen, "Life as We Know It" is less than it pretends to be.:::0:::D
A comedy as disposable -- and stinky -- as loaded Pampers.:::0:::D-
Berlanti's irreality -- following the cutesy script by Ian Deitchman and Kristin Rusk Robinson -- results in a synthetic vision of life that is, essentially, an appeasement of the pre-fab, bourgeois status quo.:::0:::None
It?s difficult not to sound like a bitter heterosexual man while writing a pan of this odious picture, but Heigl has a way of making modern love feel like a stint inside an iron maiden.:::0:::D-
Actually rather enjoyable, thanks to strong performances from the two leads and a formulaic but effective script that pushes all the right buttons.:::1:::3/5
For every moment the screenplay by Ian Deitchman and Kristin Rusk Robinson gets right, there are two more to make you cringe in embarrassment.:::0:::2.5/5
It's a sorry state of affairs when Katherine Heigl is the closest approximation of a screwball-ready actor that contemporary mainstream movies can offer.:::0:::2/5
The feminine fantasies Berlanti seemingly seeks to stoke are undercut by a vibe thats weirdly misogynistic.:::0:::None
This mildly enjoyable romantic comedy is a step in the right direction for star (and producer) Katherine Heigl, who enjoys nice rapport with Josh Duhamel, but the writing is too formulaic and not fresh enough.:::0:::C-
Despite the stars' warm chemistry, Life As We Know It is an involving but ultimately mediocre mixture of domestic melodrama and opposites-attract romantic comedy.:::0:::None
Life demonstrates quite a lot about the state of this genre as we know it -- and by that unexacting measure, anyway, it's better than most.:::1:::None
Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel do make for very attractive leads while bringing plenty of vitality to thinly written roles.:::1:::None
It's rather cute and sweet, in a sickly sort of way. But that's no longer adequate.:::0:::2/5
Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. The World adaptation cut its Adderall with pixie-stix...to gleeful, great success.:::1:::None
Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is refreshing, unique, wildly entertaining and consistently funny. I haven't had this much fun while watching a movie in a long, long time.:::1:::8/10
While there have been numerous attempts by Hollywood to cash in on the popularity of video games, none of those films has felt true to the artistic and creative spirit of those games until now. This one gets it right.:::1:::None
The cast of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World represents the best young talent coming up in Hollywood today.:::1:::B
Full of fresh, sharp touches and nonchalantly brash performances, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World consistently hits the sweet spot.:::1:::None
It's fresh, funny, inventive and unique.:::1:::None
Like the special effects, the characters are sketched out in tiresome cinematic shorthand, as if to reassure the viewer that this joyride really isn't worth thinking too hard about.:::0:::4.9/10
An unrelenting torrent of affectionate but biting music-scene satire, old-school Nintendo references, and cartoony depictions of post-adolescent love, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a delight.:::1:::3/4
Frankly, us geeks have never had it so good: Scott Pilgrim Vs The World is modern cinema at its most exciting, and it belongs to us.:::1:::5/5
Edgar Wright and his crew had a daunting task in adapting this great material, but they were able to mix it together just right for the big screen, and have ultimately made one of the best films of the year.:::1:::3.5/4
The entire film works on just how much you are willing to accept its premise: if you're fine with people developing amazing powers, characters talking directly to the camera and almost every other trick in the cinematic book, then you'll do fine:::1:::3/5
A film that defines the video game generation and redefines the romantic comedy.:::1:::4/4
Scott Pilgrim will make your head explode. But in a good way, not with brains and stuff.:::1:::8/10
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World becomes a fatal case of flash over substance. Pretty great flash, though.:::1:::2.5/4
While O'Malley's storyline and dialogue are nearly intact for the film adaptation, Wright's vision turns it into a riotous spoof of the films that made Cera a star.:::1:::None
Scott Pilgrim is a film where youth is power and power is music, video games, and confronting your exes with how great your current hook up is, but like most hipsters you meet, it is more impressed with itself than anything else:::1:::2/4
Proving that the geek shall inherit the earth ... cinema's uber-nerd Michael Cera [takes] on all comers in the quest for the girl of his dreams.:::1:::None
An almost overwhelming barrage of quirks, the adventures of Scott Pilgrim come at you at a million miles a minute but you won't mind because it's so damn entertaining.:::1:::4/5
Essentially amounts to a case of what could have been.:::0:::3/5
Scott Pilgrim is refreshing in its lack of pretension and lack of smirking hipster irony. Instead we get something sweet, genuine, and dazzlingly well made.:::1:::None
Visually daring, ingenuous and extremely entertaining, Scott Pilgrim is virtually flawless.:::1:::9/10
An interesting statement on modern youths detachment from actual human emotions through the advent of technology...:::1:::None
Not only one of the funniest movies of the summer; its utilization of over-the-top special effects unintentionally puts it up there in the action-blockbuster category it so archly parodies.:::1:::None
[It's] the funniest, most furiously action packed film of the year; one certain to be beloved by all the boys and girls who share the same passions and foibles as its foolish hero (myself included).:::1:::5/5
Video games taught a generation to fight for what you want:::1:::3/4
Some might see it as a great hipster parable, a postmodern epic for the Nintendo generation; I think it's simply a triumph of dizzying cinematic style, and it never misses a beat.:::1:::3.5/4
Fitfully entertaining and sometimes brilliantly silly &#8212; just not really engaging, and occasionally objectionable.:::0:::C-
I can only say that where some see shallowness, I saw a witty interplay of surfaces and style.:::1:::4/5
This movie is like the entirety of American youth culture crammed into a single package: It's about love, alienation, video games, comic books, chord-grinding indie/punk rock, texting, dead-end jobs and evil ex-boyfriends.:::1:::3/4
This one's geek heaven, a mash-up of comic books, computer games, grunge rock and slacker drama, all a little quicker and droller than anything of the kind before.:::1:::3/5
One of the more audacious and creatively conceived movies of the year though, at 32, I felt a bit too old for it.:::1:::4/5
A film you either love or hate. I didn't love it.:::0:::2/5
Some of us always knew playing video games was cool. Now, thanks to Scott Pilgrim, everyone else does too.:::1:::5/5
The bombardment lasts for almost two hours and by the end of the film, we feel almost as exhausted as the characters.:::0:::None
It's the old romcom story - boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy fights to win back girl. But it's steeped in pop culture, especially video games, rock and comic strips.:::1:::4/5
It understands perfectly the lunacy of being of love -- how, at the same time, it clarifies and deludes, ennobles and fells us.:::1:::4/5
If ever a film was guaranteed not to disappoint its target audience, it was surely Scott Pilgrim Vs The World.:::1:::4/5
It could have been a noisy, flashy mess, but luckily it's got heart, which makes it feel fun and unique, and more like a lo-fi, endearing mess instead.:::1:::4/5
An original, funny and clever film that's an assault on the senses.:::1:::4/5
Precisely drawn hipster farce whose rich characters all have inner lives, motivations and tortuous backstories:::1:::A
A consistently entertaining parody of contemporary cultural foibles that are apparently too marginal to be satirized in comedies that actually make money.:::1:::7/10
Scott Pilgrim tries so hard to be loved that it ends up very trying indeed.:::0:::2/5
It's a string of scenes, it's a blur of faces, it's a heaving great two-hour maelstrom of noise and punching. But it's not a proper movie.:::0:::3/5
An instant zeitgeist classic and proud bearer of yet another Wright-icised genre, as undoubtedly the best King-Kong-Bob-Omb-Rom-Com you're ever likely to see.:::1:::4/5
Hugely enjoyable, frequently funny action-pic-slash-romcom that perfectly recreates the manga meets video games vibe of the comics...:::1:::5/5
It's heartfelt, hilarious and a highly satisfying adaptation of the book. You don't have to be a geek to adore it; you just have to remember being young.:::1:::5/5
Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is endearingly relatable precisely because it celebrates the ordinary, focusing far more on the foibles and frailties of the players than on the invincible avatars of a game.:::1:::None
Tarantino, without the extraneous dialogue.:::1:::None
The level-up, super fun, dance-dance, pop culture, max-combo, rock-n-roll romance video game film of, well, forever.:::1:::3.5/4.0
Nerd Nirvana! Think Napoleon Dynamite on Red Bull. Inventive, quirky, and occasionally very funny.:::1:::B+
In a cinematic battlefield full of Inceptions and Expendables, Scott Pilgrim vs The World takes on all comers and kicks ass. One of the best films of the year so far.:::1:::5
Scott Pilgrim plays its own tune.:::1:::3.5/4.0
Also versus coherence, versus maturation, versus real emotion...:::0:::None
An energetic ode to youthful preoccupations, as well as a fun 21st century romance.:::1:::3.5/4
Sure, it's visually whizzy and often very funny, but filmmaker Wright loses the story in the scuffle.:::0:::2.5/5
leaves no mediated stone unturned and tosses anything and everything into its conceptual blender with an infectious wild abandon:::1:::3/4
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a film full of sound and fury signifying WTF. It's slick shtik.:::0:::1.5/5
What it does have is a very smart script and a tremendous amount of visual flair.:::1:::B+
For those out of the loop, or too far removed from these characters' headspace, the inventiveness of the film's execution alone is not enough.:::0:::None
For all its videogame references, this -- like Wright's previous films -- is at heart a genre satire, reinventing the John Hughes 1980s teen dramedy for the plugged-in, post-postmodern mashup generation.:::1:::4/4
Who can resist a story that self-checks its hipsterism?:::1:::None
Slick, smart and audacious, it's a film that anyone in their twenties who owns a Nintendo will be queuing around the block to see.:::1:::4/5
What if life were like a video game? In 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,' it is. And things are a lot more realistic, heart-wise, anyway, than you might expect.:::1:::3.5/4
Scott Pilgrim vs the World could well become a cultural touchstone for the Tetris generation.:::1:::4.5/5
The real star of the show is Wright, who makes an effortless transition from ambitious Brit genre helmer to blockbuster auteur.:::1:::4/5
It's loud and brash, but strangely endearing.:::1:::3/5
Adapted from Brian O'Malley's comic-book saga with breakneck stylistic verve by Edgar Wright, Scott Pilgrim Vs The World is the ultimate geek wish-fulfilment flick.:::1:::4/5
Young adults of today are a different breed. Now they finally have a movie that serves as a giant metaphor for their experiences.:::1:::3/4
She has too many exes. They should have stopped at four, because it just means these repetitive fights that are the same and they're all unbelievable and it becomes extremely tedious.:::0:::2.5/5
The film is -- perhaps surprisingly -- enjoyable, even for those of us who are a little more mature.:::1:::3.5/5
The first motion picture to successfully translate video game logic to cinema.:::1:::8/10
Edgar Wright Experiments with Video Game as Artistic Flourish and Succeeds Despite the Weakness in Structure and Cast.:::1:::3/5
Perfectly interprets the world of a slacker through the language of all the pop-culture slacker's consume (games, comics, music) Also, it's an epic nerd-splosion of pure molten awesome. FTW.:::1:::4/5
...a consistently watchable (yet all-too-superficial) piece of work.:::1:::3/4
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World or its alternate title, "Dude, Where's My Attention Span?":::0:::2.5/4
If only it was based on an actual video game. Then we could finally have 'the best movie based on a video game.':::1:::8/10
Fresh, hilarious and effortlessly cool, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is mandatory summer viewing. Every nerd, geek, freak, otaku and anyone who simply enjoys a good time at the movies should see this.:::1:::4.5/5
It may well be the most fun movie I'll see in 2010.:::1:::5/5
About half way through this film, I realised I had let my guard down. I was having too much fun. My critic's hat had fallen off.:::1:::A
Writer-director Edgar Wright has created a pop art feel to his latest work and it is sure to polarise viewers. I liked the effect. I loved the film.:::1:::None
A 112-minute entertainment contraption -- celluloid that shapeshifts its frames into video games, comic books and sitcoms.:::1:::B+
10 out of 10. You win -- perfect!:::1:::10/10
A slick synthesis of graphic novel and cinema . . . told in bold strokes and clever tropes. Though none of that would matter a gosh darn if it weren't also whomping crazy fun:::1:::5/5
A film that is a true gamechanger in every way, something so visually spellbinding and inventive that it really proves there is room out there for flat-out originality in mainstream cinema.:::1:::A
A crowning achievement in modern nerd culture, a brilliant blending of comic-book imagery, alt-rock music, video-game sensibilities, martial-arts moves and old-fashioned romance.:::1:::4/4
The best Michael Cera movie ever - but this isn't saying a lot as I have pretty much hated just about everything else he has done.:::1:::6/10
It is by turns zany, silly, and hilarious, and it features the best martial arts action ever seen in a non-Hong Kong film. Why, then, does the film so often fall flat?:::1:::None
...an ambitious big screen cross-pollination of geek sheik and vintage rom-com. It's The Matrix meets the Ghost of John Hughes. The action is way more than old NES-sy could muster, but in the end it's too damn much.:::0:::2.5/4
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is the movie that Kick-Ass wishes it could be when it grows up.:::1:::3/4
Pretty damn awesome. I was gleeful watching this film.:::1:::4.5/5
Just extraordinary filmmaking... This is how you can use modern film techniques to create a fantasy world of wonder.:::1:::None
Wright packs each frame with so many nods, winks and nudges that he could be mistaken for a schizoid.:::1:::79/100
Perhaps those who lament the influence of comics and videogames on movies should instead decry the bad films themselves and not blame the source material.:::1:::4/5
The year's best romantic comedy - so far - turns out to be so weirdly stylized that if you fall outside the 18-25 demographic you may find yourself scratching your head:::1:::3.5/5
The driving force is the snappy, witty script, one of the year's best, and each actor completely buying into Wright's camp-up-the-comedy kookiness.:::1:::3.5/4
The audience is simply not part of the process. The movie has done all the thinking for you, and by not letting itself breathe, you're excluded from an emotional reaction.:::0:::None
Like Billy Liar and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, Scott Pilgrim is a pitch-perfect evocation of a youthful underachiever's thrilling inner life.:::1:::None
Totally geeky.:::0:::C
Cast anyone else in the lead role and it might work. I assume the Scott Pilgrim of the graphic novels is actually masculine and has all the correct and working body parts.:::0:::.5/5
There's no director working today with a better sense of comic timing than Edgar Wright, who marries intelligent and funny writing and perfectly matched visuals with a savant-like skill.:::1:::9/10
Clearly a good director can take the palette of indecision, self-doubt and nerdiness Cera brings to the table and use it to paint some interesting shades of grey.:::1:::4/5
You need to take a step back to see the emotional heart of the story, an allegory of a generation struggling to exchange the solipsistic Xbox triumphs for awkward real-world love and empathy.:::1:::3/4
You won't see anything like this again for a long time. It's an imperfect film that can get downright frustrating but it displays enough flashes of genius to warrant your time and demand your forgiveness of flaws.:::1:::3.5/5
Knowing self-mockery is the name of the game.:::1:::4/4
COCKINESS + 7.:::1:::4.5/5
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is awesome but it also makes you wonder if there's more to movies than awesomeness.:::1:::3/4
The film's surreal pacing and meandering plot require viewers to hang on tight or risk being left behind. Suspension of disbelief won't cut it -- you'll need to actually demolish it if you want to keep up with the humour.:::1:::3/4
If you're under 30 you'll probably like Scott Pilgrim vs the World - if you're over 40 you might think 'like, whatever.':::1:::3.5/5
Audacious director Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead) throws a jolt of energy into the summer movie season with this imaginative and entertaining romp.:::1:::3.5/4
It's a razzle-dazzle compendium of quick-draw humor, superhero stunts and gamer references wrapped around a teen dream love story, starring -- who else? -- Michael Cera, the first genuine nerd superstar.:::1:::B+
Has moments when it is laugh out loud funny and has some truly cool action scenes but it's overdone, over the top and they are so darn smug and self-aware about everything. Ultimately suffers from gimmick overload.:::0:::C
A package of cinematic Pop Rocks, a neon-hued, defiantly non-nutritive confection that nonetheless makes you laugh at its sheer bold novelty.:::1:::None
... its highest ambition is to be the Napoleon Dynamite of 2010.:::1:::3/5
Wright takes the tools of a bloodless medium, the video game, and crafts an action-comedy with a true-blue beating heart. So what if it's built on 8-bit?:::1:::4/5
While this universe may follow blipvert logic, the characters exhibit the same longing, desire, fear and hope that anyone who's ever been in love has experienced.:::1:::A
Its speedy, funny, happy-sad spirit is so infectious that the movie makes you feel at home in its world even if the landscape is, at first glance, unfamiliar.:::1:::4/5
Once you understand its rhythms, it translates into a thrilling mash-up.:::1:::3/4
Scott Pilgrim vs The World is a mash up of pop culture from the past 40 years that's wound up in a tight package and set to detonate.:::1:::B+
One of the most completely entertaining films of the summer.:::1:::None
Clever, entertaining fantasy romance for gaming-era teens.:::1:::3/5
I haven't read a comic book in five years, and my gaming abilities center on the iPhone game "Angry Birds," but I was smitten.:::1:::3.5/4
Simply put, it's one of the most unique viewing experiences I've ever had in my life.:::1:::4.5/5
It's difficult to feel attached to it on anything other than an aesthetic level, but it is satisfactorily geeky, funny enough to recommend, and in the end not quite like anything else you'll see in the cinema this year.:::1:::4/5
The first martial arts-romantic-comedy-action-adventure-fantasy-musical.:::1:::3.5/4
If a picture as gleefully vapid as this is what passes for a 'generational milestone' in 2010, we're in trouble.:::0:::2/4
Summons that rarest of responses: It feels like something new.:::1:::4/5
...its tricky mix of tongue-in-cheek humor, fantastical battle scenes, romantic ballad-worthy swooning, and geeky signifying is, on the whole, a sweet and wondrous triumph.:::1:::8/10
I've spent perhaps 27 minutes of my entire life playing video games, and about that much time reading comic books. Yet I liked every minute of 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.':::1:::3/4
[Its] self-awareness is the saving grace. As long as nothing is taken seriously, everything is permitted, from leaps in logic to caddish heroes.:::1:::2.5/4
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a dog-frequency movie: enjoyable only to those tuned in to its particular register.:::0:::1.5/4
I tried to love it. But after 20 minutes, I sensed I was intruding on the movie's love affair with itself.:::0:::2/4
Visually cool, excellently quirky and exhilarating from start to finish with a frenetic pace that never stops.:::1:::4/4
The show is Wright's, and he takes obvious and infectious relish in the goodies the books offer him.:::1:::B+
"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World" arrives and the internerds who fell in love with the 2004 comic book, ahem, excuse me, graphic novel, rejoice. But the film is, like the comic's creator, tragically Canadian. It's "Kick-Ass" redux.:::0:::C+
For most of its hour and 53 minutes, it's a dazzling and thoroughly engaging ride through a fantasy world born of Wright's (and O'Malley's) vivid imaginations.:::1:::None
An infuriating exercise in geek-baiting populated by unlikable characters that grows more frustrating through its 113 minutes, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is more like a feature-length adaptation of Reality Bites: The Video Game.:::0:::1/4
This is a romantic adventure for the ADD age, a pop poem for Millennials that could just as well be titled Scott Pilgrim" vs. the Old Ways of Storytelling.:::1:::3/5
Be warned that you will not care one bit if the lead man and woman end up together, but you can still have a lot of fun watching them get there or not get there.:::1:::3/4
Add a tablespoon of 500 Days of Summer, a dash of Super Nintendo and a pinch of Street Fighter, and Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is served. This movie is epic!:::1:::4/5
... the only real purpose the film could serve is as a kind of cultural litmus test - to winnow out those who don't get it.:::0:::71/100
The film fuses an indie/punk rock sensibility with comic-book violence and video game energy, mixed with quirky humor and sassy pop culture references.:::1:::3/4
It's as if Wright took equal parts video game culture, comic book culture and rock 'n' roll culture, and threw it all into one giant pop culture blender. In a good way.:::1:::3/4
Much like the graphic novels that inspired it, the movie is as much a love letter to video games as it is a smart romantic comedy.:::1:::A-
A joyless and grating stab at creating a contemporary cult classic that is just as annoying and insufferable as the characters contained within and about as edgy as a trip to the auto department at Sears.:::0:::1/5
It's so jam-packed with interesting characters, I actually wanted the film to be slightly longer than its 112 minutes.:::1:::B+
It's an obnoxious, navel-gazing, uproarious tribute to a life well wasted.:::1:::3.5/4
I bet ten years from now this will be the norm. For now, it's almost revolutionary.:::1:::B+
Anyone who dismisses this film as youth-pandering video game ephemera simply isn't looking closely enough.:::1:::4.5/5
A marvel of technical and screenwriting precision, an off-kilter comic delight.:::1:::B
Favouring style over substance is generally a deal-breaker in movies like this, but then again, it's not often you see style this substantial.:::1:::4/5
Often funny, delightfully tongue-in-cheek, character-driven and wildly imaginative. It's a refreshingly witty, diverting adventure that blends fantasy and realism while never taking itself too seriously.:::1:::8.0/10
Too schizophrenic for its own good, constantly interrupting and upending its narrative with melees containing all manner of attention deficit disorder tricks.:::1:::6.5/10
The movie tongues its cheek, raises its eyebrows, and nudges our elbow in every area except where it really counts.:::0:::2/4
Imaginative, fun & funny, and highly entertaining but ultimately a bit repetitive. (Parental Review also Available):::1:::None
As a piece of action/comedy filmmaking with plenty of retro winks, Wright can put another feather in his cap.:::1:::B+
A pop-culture cocktail that is fun, funny and deliciously offbeat.:::1:::4/5
An impressive and ambitious achievement, one that manages to feel both meticulous in all its hilarious detail and at the same time, rambunctious and heartfelt.:::1:::None
Colourful, contemporary and akin to cinematic candy, Scott Pilgrim is continuously funny and endlessly inventive.:::1:::4/5
An unpeggable, one-of-a-kind slice of unorthodox cinematic heaven.:::1:::3/4
An instant cult movie, and while it certainly succeeds on that level and members of the cult will embrace it for that very reason, the uninitiated--though impressed by its style--will probably be more exhausted than delighted.:::0:::C+
The fun is not so much in who wins or loses the girl -- it's the playing that matters, and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World definitely has game.:::1:::4/5
Edgar Wright kicks the ass "Kick-Ass" merely grazed by creating a visual style that's the first to really get into the Game Boy mindset...:::1:::B+
What's the point of being clever if you're just going to follow it up with enough flaming-sword action and exploding bad guys to make our pupils hurt?:::0:::2.5/4
Wright uses split screens, slow and fast motion, violent edits and screen wipes to create an always moving and often disorienting world that will nonetheless be familiar to those who live and play in it.:::1:::3/4
Cramming every frame with as much visual and aural material as he can, Wright is a guy who gets all the neurons firing.:::1:::3/4
There are movies opening this weekend that nobody will care about in a year; people will be packing theaters for revival screenings of Scott Pilgrim in 20 years.:::1:::10/10
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is perhaps the closest any filmmaker has come yet to translating comic book material directly to the movie screen.:::1:::3/4
This kind of romance doesn't require depth; it's juvenile, irrational, adventurous - while at the same time totally pertinent. And such is the spirit of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.:::1:::4.5/5
I felt big, pink, fluffy L-O-V-E wafting from me toward the screen.:::1:::B+
The style is Sega surrealism, the narrative strategy 30% Bunuel and 70% Bally.... Wright throws things at us at such a fever pitch that the experience can be exhausting [but] the stuff he's throwing is so funny ...:::1:::None
Splashy and stylish, it's specifically geared for youthful, hyperactive viewers who are familiar with contemporary video game/comic book culture.:::1:::7/10
There's only so much you can wring out of detachment.:::0:::2.5/4
Wright proves himself an expert technician with Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, surely one of the most visually dense pieces of pop cinema ever made.:::1:::4/5
the most mind-bending hipster obsessive delight since Baz Luhrmann turned Moulin Rouge into a Nirvana-spouting, synapse-shocking spectacle:::1:::5/5
Michael Cera elevates deadpan to an art, starring as a slacker turned action hero in this wildly inventive comedy.:::1:::None
I marveled at Wright's utter disregard for stage business; his characters never quite finish menial tasks like washing their hands. I reveled in the imaginative detours of the film's transitions and garage-rock aesthetic.:::1:::4/5
I sympathize with the notion that movies can do more. But more than make us laugh? There is no higher calling.:::1:::B
Why, given its moment-to-moment surplus of visual imagination, does the film feel so hollow and unsatisfying?:::0:::C+
Michael Cera makes Scott Pilgrim into an afterthought, so it ends up being Edgar Wright's whiz-bang pop culture joy that's the real star of this sweet, funny, exciting film.:::1:::None
The film may baffle regular citizens (and migraine sufferers), but it welcomes geeks of all ages and obsessions to its circus tent.:::1:::3/4
A clever send-up of comic book and video games (circa 1990), this movie illustrates that writer/director Edgar Wright can rise to the next level.:::1:::3.5/4
This astonishing, exhilarating and funny movie has been fired directly from the world of comic books at the big screen with genre-smashing panache.:::1:::4.5/5
"Scott Pilgrim" devotes itself so firmly to re-creating the look of O'Malley's saga that it forces and fumbles the feel, full of (indie-rock) sound and (kung-fu) fury, (emotionally) signifying nothing.:::0:::2.5/5
The movie is packed with characters and likable actors, and if you know the source it's fun seeing how the filmmakers have cast to the cartoon.:::1:::3/4
Like an animatronic kitten that won't leave you alone, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World wins its audience over on adorable persistence.:::1:::3/4
Michael Cera makes for a fine action hero. And while I'm at it, keep Brandon Routh as Superman!:::1:::4.25/5
Shallow ... repetitive ... Still: Being really funny and dorky-chic is the goal here and that's exactly what Scott Pilgrim is.:::1:::3/5
At its best, Wright's film is raucous, impudent entertainment.:::1:::3/4
It is a movie fueled by the lunatic inspiration of the very best games and cartoons, awash with stylistic flourishes and exhilarating, anime-inspired skirmishes that reflect the director's passion for both.:::1:::3.5/4
Scott Pilgrim is about as perfect as it could be. The experience is like looking at a painting. You either instinctively like, dislike, loathe, or love what you are seeing.:::1:::None
Features a lot of old ideas presented in new ways, and that skewed approach manages to make both action and romance seem like the freshest things at the movies.:::1:::4/5
...an exhilarating burst of adolescence, a youth movement of wit, energy, ingenuity and sweetness.:::1:::3.5/4
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is not like anything you've ever seen before. Wright mixes the structure of musicals and action films to break up what starts out as a fairly naturalistic relationship comedy with wildly fantastical action fights.:::1:::B-
Everything hinges on a character so shallow and self-absorbed he's impossible to invest in:::1:::3/5
It may be that Wright has given us the best video-game inspired film yet.:::1:::None
So what if he passes the Herculean he-man test the story puts him through? He still has all the sexual charisma of an untied shoelace. And even a woman who likes the soft touch can't do much with that.:::0:::None
Could Michael Cera be getting more vaporous with each repeat of his epicene screen persona?:::0:::1.5/4
Wright keeps the cast and the film rigidly in line for such a wild ride, and it works.:::1:::4/5
The dialogue and the music keep you engaged, at least while the movie lasts.:::1:::None
It's a true original.:::1:::B+
This is the kind of movie that its participants refer to in small, dismissive groans at reunion parties.:::0:::0.5/4
A cliched mess, this comedy lacks the carefree humor of its superior predecessor.:::0:::1.0/5
Writer/director Michael Patrick King seems intent on turning Carrie into the most irritatingly selfish, shallow, materialistic character ever to hit any screen.:::0:::0/4
An echo of the series' glory, but that won't stop the fans. Costumes and one-liners take precedence over female bonding.:::0:::None
This franchise is now officially at war with itself. In order to maintain audience demand for a high level of vicariously thrilling wealth.:::0:::1.5/5
It's a toss up which is a worse fate: replacing original creators with hired hands who approach the series mechanically; or letting the originators continue until it becomes apparent they've run out of steam. Sex and the City 2 picks the latter.:::0:::4.5/10
[Michael] King has done well to maintain the wry comedy Sex and the City is so well known for, especially considering the over-stretched 146-minute running time.:::1:::3.5/5
It's a fairy-tale about fashion, jewelry, gowns, Maybach automobiles, private jets, Rolex watches, style, sophistication, and glamor, and I couldn't wait for it to end.:::0:::4/10
Sex and the City 2 is the female equivalent of Transformers; a big, dumb blockbuster that doesn't require you to think very hard, if at all ... I mourn the death of four memorable television characters that used to mean something to so many.:::0:::1/5
Dobra vijest za gledatelje je da Seks i grad 2 nije loiji od prethodnog filma; loa vijest je da nije nimalo bolji:::0:::2/10

Strictly for the hardcore fans, "Sex And The City 2" may not be in vogue for long.:::0:::3/10
It might be time for Carrie & Company to hang up the ManoloBlahniks.:::0:::None
... a crummy little vehicle without dignity and too cramped for its fancy clothes.:::0:::2/5
With SATC2 we were supposed to get a peek at what's next. Instead we got a fanciful vacation and a lame and fluffy version of female power.:::0:::2/4
The spectacle of four supposedly high-achieving, professional NYC sophisticates "Ooohing" and "Aahing" at a tacky gilt and red-brick fantasy Middle East escaped from a Disney rejects storehouse is beyond risible.:::0:::None
Samantha does everything but draw a picture of the Prophet Muhammad on a pair of crotchless panties.:::0:::0/10
Unlike the first film, this is self-involved, silly and whiny...and so are the characters.:::0:::1.5/4
Girls, let's have another Cosmpolitan and remember the past fondly. But make way for Chelsea [Handler]. She drinks vodka neat. She's a real woman.:::0:::1.5/5
Sarah Jessica Parker is now 45 years old, and, frankly, I cannot stomach another moment of the simpering, mincing, hair-tossing, eyelash-batting little-girl shtick she's been pulling ever since L.A. Story.:::0:::None
As for Sarah, looking like what the cat dragged in and then spit out, she's forgotten how to act. Whenever she's on screen, an immediate lack of energy is apparent. It's as if the screen's a black hole sucking up life like a Bounty towel on baby drool.:::0:::3/10
A new nadir. It's a movie that ignores just about every one of the show's good aspects and plays up everything bad - all while lasting an unforgivably long 146 minutes.:::0:::1/5
Michael Patrick King throws Carrie Bradshaw & Co. under the intellectual bus, making them do monumentally stupid things to satisfy the plot's demands.:::0:::1.5/4
When the best scenes in a movie feature Liza Minnelli singing "Single Ladies" and the foursome singing "I Am Woman," you know the concept has lost its sparkle.:::0:::1.5/4
I realize that gaudy fantasy is essential to this franchise, but why does the fantasy have to be so stunted?:::0:::C
"Memaws on Mid-Life Support." To see this movie again, you'd have to grab me by the Barneys and push me hard through the Dior.:::0:::D
The film's tone-deaf cultural awareness extends to a boozy karaoke rendition of "I Am Woman" which is equal parts naive/patronising.:::0:::1.5/5
Best to quit now while there are still a few bubbles left in the champagne.:::1:::3.5/5
Sex and the City has turned into a bloated juggernaut of pointlessness. Its female characters are now beyond unbearable, none more so than Carrie.:::0:::1/5
There's only one thing worse than faking an orgasm: faking laughter. Shame on you, Sex and the City 2, for being a 2.5-hour laughless fake-a-thon that never finds the right spot.:::0:::1/5
So long as you're happy to suspend your sense of reality and turn a blind eye to the lack of depth in the story, you'll still find some enjoyment with our favourite fab four.:::1:::3/5
Whenever the light is just right and the angle is just plain wrong, each star gets an unflattering close-up that leaves them looking like drag-queen stand-ins.:::0:::None
While I think it's cute that people get all dressed up and have little parties going to this movie, the actual film is a hellish, embarrassing abomination.:::0:::.5/5
It's all talk and no action.:::0:::2/5
Sex 2: Narcissism run rampant.:::0:::2.0/4.0
These girls are so hung up on looking great they've forgotten there are several ways to be ugly.:::0:::1/5
It takes everything that was bad about the first Sex And The City movie, and nothing that was good about the Sex And The City TV series, and mixes it together with a bit of racism to create something even worse.:::0:::1/5
Once again, Michael Patrick King packs four movies into two and a half hours, and yet there's not quite enough substance for one film. There plenty of snappy one-liners and silly situations, but it will severely test the patience of any non-fan.:::1:::3/5
If you are contemplating watching the film, you'd be better off with a night in and the box set. Cosmopolitans optional.:::0:::1/5
Any emotional intelligence or investment made in the television series is crushed into dust under a signature Louboutin sole, and then cast into the 'Arabian' desert along with any shred of the actresses' dignity.:::0:::None
It may be easy to dismiss it as a merely superficial experience: it's all about the clothes, the shoes, the designer life, and of course that's part of it. But it's also about the lives of these women that we've shared for twelve years now.:::1:::3/5
A movie that does nothing but push its target audience's pleasure buttons is destined to be an abomination, a camp classic or both.:::0:::2/10

There's still enough of the Sex and the City magic for those who fell in love with the show more than a decade ago. Nothing is as smart as it was; it's not as edgy, it's not as cute, it's sagged a bit. But then, haven't we all?:::1:::3.25/5

Fans and fashionistas will sit back and savour Sex And The City 2. Everyone else will probably conclude you can have too much of a good thing.:::1:::3/5
It's like a magic carpet ride for Barbie dolls in which designer fashion and life's frustrations play on a bed of friendship. It ends up with little sex or city, falling short of its promise.:::0:::None
all four women step up onto a karaoke stage in Abu Dhabi and give a rousing rendition of "I Am Woman" surrounded by a bevy of belly dancers. There is just so much wrong with that image that it'S hard to know where to start. But then again, why bother?:::0:::0/5
Same old silliness, only worse.:::0:::2/5
A perfectly pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. The vitriol directed against this movie mostly has to do with the ageism and sexism of the reviewers rather than its merits.:::1:::None

Parents, lock up your fanboys! ... Admittedly, annoying these computer trolls sounds like reason enough to give Sex and the City 2 a hearty recommendation, but the truth of the matter is that this follow-up to the 2008 smash doesn't quite measure up.:::0:::2.5/4

This second cinematic bite of the apple far exceeds expectations and is a significant improvement over the 2008 movie. Every outfit worn by these endearing ladies is...:::1:::3.5/4

The main goal is to transport its target audience to the decidedly less mundane world of Carrie and Friends, and in that sense, the movie is more than successful.:::1:::B

Shopping, sex, and stereotypes merge in trite sequel.:::0:::2/5
The film is most likeable when it remembers that it is meant to be more than an exercise in middle-aged, middle-class smugness and self-absorption. Its principal strength remains its celebration of female friendship.:::1:::3/5

Remember the old, boundary-breaking, taboo-toppling Sex and the City? Forget it. Neither sex nor the city plays any role in this film.:::0:::None
It has no plot to speak of, little in the way of wit or intelligence, and is about 50% longer than can reasonably be justified.:::0:::1/4
At two and a half hours, Sex 2 -- like its predecessor -- is a long sit in the shallows, the equivalent of five half-hour episodes strung together.:::0:::2/4

Very limited shots of New York City, destroying a beloved character, and the girls have all matured and are no longer what Sex and the City was and has been about.:::0:::2/5
A miscalculation of feminine power so extreme that our country's threat level should immediately be raised.:::0:::0.5/4
Overly long, superficial and shallow. Their closets have been updated but not their sensitivity.:::0:::6/10
Glamour porn with fashion that looks like Lady Gaga at a Wal-Mart shopping spree and a plot that at times is cinematic roadkill. Nonetheless, these are still likable and entertaining characters. The movie did its job and because of that, I enjoyed it.:::1:::B-
Disposable, glitzy fun lacking depth or staying power, Sex And The City 2 is the cinematic version of karaoke: a giddy, silly hoot best enjoyed in tipsy groups.:::1:::3/5
The creator has not absorbed any lesson of his first film's weaknesses: The zeitgeist has changed considerably since the 1990s, not to mention the fact that the four women are simply too old for such silly escapades.:::0:::C-
The ugly smell of unexamined privilege hangs over this film like the smoke from cheap incense.:::0:::2.5/5
Each in different stages of their well preserved-and well heeled-lives, the "Fab Four's" dramadies continue for the audiences who love them. Trouble is the surrounding story and its supposedly fun sojourns are as embarrassing as granny panties.:::0:::2.5/5
Like a plastic surgeon, storyteller King keeps trying to find new ways to lift and tighten his characters, but they have become garish caricatures of themselves.:::0:::3.5/5
This film sequel based on the long-running HBO series douses whatever sparkle remains of these beloved characters and their adventures in the big city.:::0:::1.5/5
It's worse than Sex and the City 1, and that alone is a remarkable achievement.:::0:::0.5/4
Vapid, overlong, painfully unfunny, preposterous and, worst of all, boring. It's so bad that it's gone past good and back to bad again.:::0:::.65/10
This feels bigger and more cinematic than the first film, and sees a progression in the lives of the characters. But many of the jokes are beyond broad, and the Middle Eastern stereotypes are shockingly cack-handed.:::0:::2/5
Even in the context of that lumpy, overpriced Birkin bag of stuff we call Hollywood product, Sex and the City 2 hits a new low of idiocy and crassness.:::0:::2.5/10
Badly misjudged, poorly plotted sequel that will disappoint even die-hard fans of the show, thanks to a hideously offensive second half that destroys any remaining goodwill towards the rest of the film.:::0:::2/5
It's actually hard to describe just how bad Sex and the City 2 really is.:::0:::2/10
The franchise will eventually, like all things, come to an end ... Sex and the City 2 is one step closer to that inevitability, so there is hope in it.:::0:::1/4
This may be this first time since "Lucky Lady" that I walked away from a film thinking that it needed more Liza.:::0:::1/5
When Marie Antoinette did this, the people tore down the f'ing Bastille. When our "Sex and the City" girls do it, they slurp it up like box rose and Haagen-Dazs.:::0:::0/4

This is a sequel that doesn't come close to justifying its existence.:::0:::2/4
Sex and the City 2 is a champagne cocktail on a runaway train -- fizzy, sparkly, giddy-making, and splashing all over the place.:::1:::2.5/4
It's a marathon of shopping, eating, oooh-ing, and gasping. Or, for the viewers, retching and dozing.:::0:::None
When Carrie asks Big, "Am I just a bitch wife who nags you?" I could hear all the straight men in the theater -- all four of us -- being physically prevented from responding.:::0:::None
For a franchise that was supposed to be adventurous about sex, this film is about as cutting-edge as The Love Boat. But if you're a fan, you'll get your money's worth.:::1:::3/4
Suggesting some kind of quasi-feminist Manhattan-boosterism has always made the Sex and the City series phony, as well as loathsome.:::0:::None

Sarah Jessica Parker is now 45 years old, and, frankly, I cannot stomach another moment of the simpering, mincing, hair-tossing, eyelash-batting little-girl shtick she's been pulling ever since she emerged...:::0:::None
Will the film appeal to the franchise's core fan base? Yeah, I suppose. To the rest of the world, this is one of the most aggressively unlikable films to hit screens in quite some time. (Parental Review also included):::0:::None

As Carrie might type on her laptop while giving one of her girly little shrugs, When did Sex and the City become so long and mean so little?:::0:::C-
The gossamer-thin plot is more flimsy than some of the characters' dresses and at 146 minutes, the sequel overstays its welcome by the best part of an hour.:::0:::3/5
Perhaps it's time to call it a day.:::0:::1/5
The film might have triumphed as a musical: camp, virtually plotless, and liberally sequined. But sadly this sequel is not Sex and the City -- it is Menopause in the Desert, and a waste of four great characters.:::0:::2/5
Filled with lame Niqab jokes that could have been lifted out of ISHTAR, or a bad episode of FAMILY GUY.:::0:::4/10
That Charlotte would then deny her Jewish husband's name because she wants to enjoy the proffered ultra-deluxe freebie, explaining, "This is the Middle East," is arguably despicable.:::0:::C-
The sequel is too long and is missing that sparkle and surprise factor which made the series and first film so enjoyable. Even Samantha's character felt forced and overdone.:::0:::2.5/5
...a moving, surprisingly traditional 'women's picture' in ridiculous, overpriced clothing.:::1:::3/4
Sex and the City 2 is even worse than its predecessor -- a shallow cash grab that suffers from a bloated runtime and lack of story.:::0:::2/5
It's self-indulgent, way too long and never as clever or funny as it's intended to be.:::0:::1.5/4
Bad puns, fashion porn, domestic handwringing, contrived plot points, idiotic dialogue and offensive stereotypes. What's not to loathe?:::0:::1/5
Women, this isn't empowerment; it's like watching Us Weekly prank call the New York Times.:::0:::1.5/5
I enjoyed these characters more when they were rich, rather than obscenely rich, when their self-involvement and life crises had one foot on planet Earth -- and when they weren't all gussied up like Mae West in Sextette.:::0:::2/4
As tasteless as an Arabian cathouse, as worn-out as your 1998 flip-flops and as hideous as the mom jeans Carrie wears with a belly-baring gingham top, Sex and the City 2 is two of the worst movies of the year.:::0:::1/4
Even director Michael Patrick King, known for his sense of excess, seems to recognize that we've been down this road before, and we know where it ends.:::0:::2/4
There are heisty hijinks involving lost passports and spice bags and menopause drugs and "inter-friend-tions," but they all just blow pointlessly around in the desert dust.:::0:::1/5
King and his cast seem content to put everything on autopilot and hope glamour and shopping sprees will be enough to carry them. Nothing much happens -- and it takes 2.5 hours for it not to happen in.:::0:::2/4
Though the sequel is a welcome return of the four women we know and love, it's tough not to acknowledge that if we were all friends in real life, at this point we'd probably stop taking their calls.:::0:::2/5
The first SATC film was such a downbeat snooze that one assumed it couldn't get worse. But it can - and it does.:::0:::None
An insult to the memory of the cleverly written show and its celebration of friendship, it's a slap in the face for the four gal pals (often photographed at unflattering angles) and an affront to Muslims.:::0:::1.5/4
Some of these people make my skin crawl. The characters of Sex and the City 2 are flyweight bubbleheads living in a world which rarely requires three sentences in a row.:::0:::1/4
One wrongheaded jaw-dropper follows another, from Samantha's description of a gay manservant as "Paula Abdul" to a comic climax in which the ladies escape an angry male mob by wearing hijabs and abayas given to them by like-minded Muslim women.:::0:::2/5
Honestly, by the time they ride camels, it's Ishtar in designer gowns.:::0:::2/5
Here's another measure of how drastically the recession has affected American culture: Sex and the City isn't fun anymore.:::0:::C-
It's slower and more of an eye-roller than the first film, but also a lot more about the women.:::0:::2/4
The only thing memorable about Sex and the City 2 is the number two part, which describes it totally, if you get my drift.:::0:::None
In this second screen incarnation of the fabulous HBO series, the satire is sagging, the irony's atrophied and the funny is flabby.:::0:::2.5/5
Rights most of the wrongs of its predecessor, reclaiming all of the intelligence, humanity and humor audiences received when the series was airing. Most important, spending time with Carrie & Co. is once again a blast. The real them had been missed.:::1:::3/4
There's a beating human heart at the origin of the Sex and the City behemoth, but this unwelcome, undignified sequel does everything it can to bury it.:::0:::2/5
If Sex and the City was Star Wars for girls, then Sex and the City 2 is The Empire Strikes Back. The ladies of Sex and the City still are sexy, sassy and living large.:::1:::3/4
Continues to be little more than the female equivalent to porn, a fashionable but unrealistic fairy tale with very little actual meat, but this time, it feels more like a cash grab.:::0:::6/10
Had the filmmakers created an all-out sex farce porno centered on Kim Cattrall's cougar-in-heat Samantha Jones, then at least the genre would fit the material's instant gratification intentions.:::0:::D

It's not often a horror film reaches into the depths of my soul, grabs my heart and shatters it into a billion terrified pieces.:::0:::1/4
In a coma on life-support. Not sexy, no story, ugly clothes, the women look horribly aged but Max Ryan is sex in the desert. Insults a Muslim culture.:::0:::None
A bloated, wearyingly unsubtle, dramatically inert valentine to conspicuous consumption. The movie's overly demonstrative acting style -- embodied in varying degrees by all four leads -- seems pitched at small children.:::0:::2/5
The most depressing thing about Sex and the City 2 is that it seems to justify every nasty thing said and written about the series and first feature film.:::0:::None
Michael Patrick King's fascist, superficial assessment of the Sex and the City girls' intelligence insults them as the women we came to know them as on television, and no doubt has Susan Sontag turning in her grave.:::0:::1.5/4

What a pleasant surprise this movie is ...:::1:::B+
It's not insightful or original about anything more than a generic self-esteem boost for goony dudes who dream of hot babes, but it's never not doing cartwheels to make you laugh.:::1:::3/5
The story relies on the strength of the characters and effectiveness of the comedy to keep it going. And for the most part it works.:::1:::3.5/5
She's Out Of My League might be the most important romantic comedy of the past twenty five years. If only it was funny enough to warrant such an accolade.:::1:::3/5
She's Out of My League is not big on originality, yet it scores points for addressing self esteem and body image issues amongst young males.:::1:::3/5

Formulaic and inoffensively bland.:::0:::2/5
Jay Baruchel gets his shot at Hollywood leading-man status in this likable, goofy romcom. And I have to say I'd rather be watching him than the ubiquitous Shia LaBeouf.:::1:::3/5
Here is yet another American comedy in which a beautiful woman falls head over high heels in love with a worthless geek.:::0:::2/5
It's not half as bad as it sounds thanks to the likable, grounding presence of Baruchel, plus Nate Torrence as his chubby pal.:::1:::3/5
Eve sparkles, Baruchel amuses and the film as a whole is irresistible.:::1:::3/5
She's Out Of My League is a predictable yet hugely enjoyable genre piece that relies on our natural empathy for Baruchel's nice guy...:::1:::None
With his debut feature, English director Jim Field Smith handles the humour with skill. A solid if formulaic addition to the genre.:::1:::3/5
This is the rare one with unisex appeal - it's sweet and it's raunchy, and it has an underdog male lead of huge oddball charisma in Jay Baruchel.:::1:::3/5
A funny and charming romcom.:::1:::4/5
Fast, frequently funny and isn't a chore to watch. Measured on its own dating scale, She's Out Of My League is a solid six with room to climb higher.:::1:::3/5
The gross-out level is kept to a minimum and the language is reasonably clean, making it a refreshing change from similar testosterone-fueled movies.:::1:::3/5
For all its rude humour and chucklehead antics, this is actually a sweet and shy romantic comedy. It also boosts Jay Baruchel into leading-man status with a thoroughly charming performance.:::1:::3.5/5
While there's no particular originality to proceedings, each character is eminently likeable, and while that doesn't neccesarily translate to memorable comedic gold, it just about works well as a new contender.:::1:::3/5
Hugely enjoyable, frequently funny romcom with likeable characters, a witty script, a steady stream of laugh-out-loud gags and terrific performances from its two leads.:::1:::4/5
Like its hero, it has hidden depths -- it's just a shame they're not allowed to shine.:::0:::2/5
The direction from first-timer Jim Field Smith is bland and without character, and you feel that if someone with more confidence and a swagger to their filmmaking had been in charge we'd have seen something that stepped beyond cinematic mediocrity:::0:::2/5
Sloppy, sometimes tasteless and at times silly, 'She's Out of My League' is a lovable mess. It's raunchy humor with a heart of gold.:::1:::3/4
Some half-way decent character comedy props up this otherwise pretty frivolous outing that marks burgeoning star Jay Baruchel's first cinematic leading role.:::1:::3/5
Although the film follows all the usual peaks and valleys of a typical rom-com, She's Out of My League gets a pass for making me laugh even when it's at its most formulaic.:::1:::3.5/5

has neither the comedy nor the romance nor the insight to deepen its central gimmick:::0:::2/5
The hackneyed conceit of the dork who dreams big earns a zero for originality, but the cast -- which includes Mike Vogel, T.J Miller, and Krysten Ritter as friends of the mismatched couple -- is close to an 8.:::1:::2.5/4
Lots of bro-banter and bodily function goofs smother a good idea:::0:::C
Directed by Englishman Jim Field Smith and scripted by Sean Anders and John Morris of the upcoming "Hot Tub Time Machine," "She's Out of My League" stays afloat for its first hour thanks to the comic water-treading talent of its cast.:::0:::C
Every time I thought it was developing a comic pace, it would stumble, most notably in a few extended, ridiculous gross-out scenes late in the film.:::0:::None
Too much profanity and crude talk but at heart it is an endearing romantic comedy which should raise the ante on Baruchel and Eve's careers:::1:::6/10
It is mindless fun, especially for Baruchel fans, with a little heart and surprising charm thrown in for good measure.:::1:::3.5/5
It's got a stale premise, dumb jokes, [and] characters who exist only to remind you of other characters in slightly better movies.:::0:::None
Like the confused hero standing at the cross-tarmac of his life, this film isn't sure which way's up. Derisive, sophomoric humor or perky rom-com? Underwear jokes or glowing life lessons on personal evolution?:::0:::5/10
Mildly amusing and charming, but often bland, tedious and not nearly as funny as it could have been with a gutsier and more imaginative screenplay.:::0:::5.0/10
Every man's fantasy is a hot relationship with a drop-dead gorgeous, head-turning fox. At age 14 reality sinks in and most guys realize it's never going to happen.:::1:::4/5
Welcome to the plot of every underdog romantic comedy ever -- there are indeed some good laughs, but the story here is negligible.:::0:::None
The four actors have an appealing rapport -- as offhandedly sweet as it is determinedly raunchy -- and Miller and Vogel especially enliven pretty standard fare.:::1:::7/10
Starts out working more -- not to mention working better -- as a comedy of manners and social mores before falling back on raunchy humor and sprints to the gate.:::1:::None
This raunchy piece of Judd Apatow-lite is a tart confection with a sweet center.:::1:::3/4
It's not particularly funny, it runs a bit long, and it certainly uses its fair share of cliches, but it somehow manages to be charming and likable for most of its runtime.:::0:::C
If you combined Knocked Up with There's Something About Mary...you'd have some idea of how oddly disjointed yet ultimately satisfying She's Our of My League is.:::1:::3/5
Jay Baruchel, a funny and solid supporting player, is not quite ready for the big leagues with this lackluster rom-com.:::0:::2/5
As crude buddy comedies go, it's a shave above.:::1:::3.5/5
It's still an R-rated comedy with its fair share of raunchy moments, but it's also clever and disarmingly sweet. Not a "10," but certainly a "7," with bonus points for exceeding expectations.:::1:::3/4
The writers and director Jim Field Smith show a refreshing level of commitment to something besides broad caricatures and crotch jokes.:::1:::2.5/4
Forgettable sub-Apatow fare that even the personable leads can't save from utter mediocrity.:::0:::C-
Nothing would work, though, without the appealing Baruchel.:::1:::4/5
There are compensations, in Baruchel's performance and in Eve's too (now that's an ingenue's name).:::1:::3/4
Not as crass, or as sophisticated, as the Apatow-themed humor that it aspires to, "She's Out of My League" succeeds on the strength of its gawky leading man.:::1:::B-
[T]reat[s] its own plot as a huge mystery... you can almost feel the movie shaking its head in bewilderment...:::0:::None
Remarkably good performances by the supporting cast give this beauty-and-the-beast romantic comedy some laughs and warmth, but finding chemistry between the leads proves out of its league.:::0:::None
The premise might work if the film were content to be a fairly undistinguished example of over-the-top gross-out comedy.:::0:::1.5/5
... skirts the gummy shoals of the profane, [yet still] heartwarming, laugh-out-loud funny, and actually sort of romantic in a puckishly real world way:::1:::3/5
If the Farrelly Brothers and Judd Apatow somehow mated, the result of their union might be She's Out of My League.:::1:::3/5
The two leads create a sweet, believable romance that deserves a better movie.:::0:::2.5/4
She's Out of My League doesn't answer the question of whether a 10 would go for a 5, but rather if audiences are willing to settle for a 5.:::0:::C
Director Jim Field Smith lifts his best beats from Judd Apatow, and his worst from American Pie.:::0:::None
The movie's terrific -- it's easily my favorite film released so far this year.:::1:::4.5/5
It's a little rushed, and a little rough around the edges, but She's Out of My League is genuinely nutty and funny, and with some likeable characters at its center.:::1:::3/5
And even if League isn't up to the Judd Apatow/Kevin Smith standards of smart-guy rom-coms, it's still funny and charming enough to rate as a lovely little post-Oscar season date movie.:::1:::3/5
It kind of feels like Smith, Anders and Morris just threw as many jokes on the wall as they could and saw how many of them would stick. Fortunately, enough of them do adhere to said wall that you'll forget about most of the ones that don't.:::1:::3.5/5
Demonstrates how hard it is to achieve that Apatow balance between aww-inspiring tenderness and wince-inducing body-fluid slapstick...:::0:::2/4
It's funny, and kinda sweet, but they shouldn't classify it as comedy. It's sci-fi/fantasy.:::1:::3/4
Has a lot of spirit and heart and actually quite sweet, but it tries to shoehorn too many ideas into one movie and not all of them work.:::0:::6/10
The movie clearly aspires to rise to the smutty-but-sweet synergy of other, better films. But She's Out of My League can't touch them.:::0:::1/4
Scenes that should be grotesquely funny (man helps another man with his intimate grooming, or the appearance of a Hall & Oates cover band) deliver only chuckles rather than a big payoff.:::0:::2/4
Its gormless, assertion-free protagonist offends as a role model for idiot youths, and, even worse, offends as drama.:::0:::D
She's Out of My League is a rowdy blast because the spiky young cast treats the played-out script like virgin territory. That's acting!:::1:::2.5/4
The leads are better than the movie deserves. Baruchel is likable, and Eve comes off as somewhat more human than you expect in efforts like this.:::0:::1/4
We may know exactly where Kirk and Molly are headed -- he can't get over his good fortune and she can't abide being put on a pedestal -- but the movie keeps upending our expectations and provoking laughs.:::1:::3/4
While it's a bigger fantasy film than The Lord of the Rings, it owns its implausibility in a way that endures rather than repulses.:::1:::5/10
There's barely a smirk in all of its padded hour and 45 minutes...:::0:::1/5
You're out of its league.:::0:::1/4
A surprisingly sweet-natured affair with solid performances.:::1:::2.5/4
This bad-mannered love story has a funny foul mouth with a few bright spots of charm.:::1:::2.5/4
It's short on clever humor and big on convention and formula.:::0:::2/4
A diverting showcase for Baruchel and Eve, who are excellent arguments for the proposition that there's more to a person than looks.:::1:::2.5/4
Baruchel and the others make this often-crude comedy work when it probably shouldn't.:::0:::2/4
While Baruchel is fun to root for and watch flail about like a pipe-cleaner in the wind, this movie encourages a sick desire in me - to see Michael Cera and all the runners-up in the Mr. Puniverse Contest knocked down a peg...:::0:::2/4
I'll say this: it's neither a "5" nor a "10," but somewhere in between.:::1:::3/4
The movie also does well to let the supporting characters carry the comedic load.:::1:::B
It's undeniably formulaic stuff. The film seems to actively invite comparisons with Apatow's oeuvre.:::0:::2/5
Instantly forgettable.:::0:::1.5/5
We like them, and we're not used to characters in a comedy like this being so blunt, honest, and self-aware.:::1:::3/4
By mixing the sweetness of "Say Anything" with the silliness of "There's Something About Mary," "She's Out of My League" works as well as it does thanks to a real sense of heart and a killer ensemble.:::1:::3/5
Impossible to hate.:::1:::3/5
Parental Content Review:::0:::None
The title says it all, and the mismatch of tone parallels the mismatch in the story.:::0:::C
Yet another irritating, frustrating, artificial Hollywood product that trades honesty and depth for grade school immaturity and a bunch of lazy, derivative, totally unfunny jokes involving sexual organs and bodily fluids.:::0:::1.5/4
Of all the Judd Apatow-era imitators, She's Out of My League is one of the better ones.:::1:::B
It's too hellbent on becoming the next "There's Something About Mary" or Judd Apatow offshoot to realize it's finest quality is its tender heart.:::0:::2/4
Hardly original, but it knows what works: Think of it as 'The Twentysomething (Almost) Virgin.' It even has an unfortunate male grooming scene similar to the chest-waxing in "Virgin," though this one focuses on an area a wee bit south of that.:::1:::3/4
An uninspired romantic comedy/male self-esteem pep-talk that seems to be yearning for viewer affection despite its all-around mediocrity.:::0:::1.5/4
Though Baruchel does his best to ground the film in some vague semblance of identifiable reality, he's surrounded on all sides by human cartoons, each pushing bad advice or roping him into the next grotesque comic setpiece.:::0:::D
[T.J.] Miller's the find. He's out of this movie's league.:::0:::None
I laughed out loud a handful of times and chuckled on a regular basis. In the end, isn't that all we really want from those sweet, mindless comedies Hollywood continues to offer?:::1:::3/4
Generously funny, sporadically heartfelt, and infinitesimally honest, League shows surprising signs of life. For a big dumb comedy about losers and hotties, the toil to capture any sort of dimension is welcome.:::1:::B
A movie can't achieve a nakedly honest dude vibe like I Love You, Man when the characters are this irritating.:::0:::1.5/5
No, we still don't believe them as a couple. No, th:::1:::3/5
I don't hate the new A Nightmare on Elm Street on principle. I hate the new A Nightmare on Elm Street because it sucks.:::0:::0.5/4
A Nightmare On Elm Street will give me bad dreams of studio executives counting up their filthy lucre made off of a generation willing to accept this sort of spoon-fed garbage and not of the monster they've so completely neutered by this point.:::0:::None
A tightly wound experience that gets even more tense as it builds toward its shattering finale.:::1:::4/5
While the 1984 film has aged, its now-familiar jolts still pack more punch than this pic's recycled ones, which sometimes register so tepidly as to cause snickers.:::0:::None
A flat, lifeless remake that's totally unnecessary, except of course to the studio executives who want to extract still more profit from the property.:::0:::D
The film cops virtually every memorable image from the original, but loses the depth that gave them power and the sense of place that grounded them.:::0:::D
Bayer's stylish visual direction does little to detract from the fact this is essentially the same movie with far too many visual nods and little to differentiate it or set it apart from the original.:::0:::4.5/10
Good luck staying awake.:::0:::None
... Like watching a brilliant garage band's sparse, smart singles turned into loud, expensive, overproduced karaoke sing-along versions with the same notes and lyrics but none of the passion and power.:::0:::1.5/5
The novelty has long since worn off, and cheap, generic scares are all that are left.:::0:::None
I stared at A Nightmare on Elm Street with weary resignation. The movie consists of a series of teenagers who are introduced, haunted by nightmares and then slashed to death by Freddy. So what?:::0:::1/4
Using blasts of shrill, high-decibel noise in place of actual scares has become a common horror-movie tactic, the cinematic equivalent of botox, silicone, and penile-enhancement surgery.:::0:::None
Freddy's 2010 makeover made him look like a burn victim meets a Na'vi creature from 'Avatar.' Also, for a movie that is about its characters fighting sleep to survive, it's a shame 'Elm Street' induces a few REM-driven naps.:::0:::C-
Nancy who? Freddy did what? What's the razor glove about? These kids have parents? Bayer's more interested in the lighting design than he is winding a dazzling tale of mental invasion and teen paranoia.:::0:::D+
There hasn't been this unnecessary of a back story since Ron Howard felt the need to dramatize the childhood of one Mr. Grinch.:::0:::1/4
It's a movie that starts slowly, and only starts moving us to the edge of our seat in the third act, adequate for a horror picture, but no more.:::0:::2/4
I've seen far worse horror remakes, but let's not grade on too much of a curve: This Nightmare offers dutifully grinding thrills of a routine sort.:::0:::2/4
Too many more remakes as dull and bland as A Nightmare on Elm Street could kill off horror movies for good.:::0:::2/4
In a way, Freddy finally makes sense in this version of Elm Street, but Robert Englund's original Freddy is still preferable to Haley's pervy Groundskeeper Willy.:::0:::1.5/4
Lazy directing on the behalf of Oliver Stone, the miscasting of Shia LaBeouf and an often incomprehensible plot turn this film into a total mess.:::0:::4/10
The bottom line on "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps" is that it is sprinkled with inspired scenes, but is never able to fully engage the viewer because of its meandering and unfocused storylines.:::0:::2.5/4
As a comment on the recession it's a spineless failure, but as a piece of entertaining fluff it does its job well.:::1:::3/5
Maybe Stone's growth as a filmmaker mirrors that of Gordon's as a person; having had time to calm down a bit over the years, he seems to have settled into a more relaxed state.:::1:::3/5
In the midst of all the incomprehensible money-babble, there are still pit stops of entertainment.:::0:::2.5/5
There really is a lot to like about Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps but ultimately, like the trader's they're chronicling, the filmmakers are unable to resist the impulse to have their cake and eat it too.:::1:::6.5/10
Those who see [Gordon Gekko] as an antihero worthy of redemption might find this kinder, gentler Wall Street worth sitting through.:::1:::6/10
Stone has missed the moment with his belated sequel ... Instead of being ahead of the game, he's now lagging behind [and] he's made a movie that already seems out of date.:::0:::None
A decidedly inferior sequel.:::0:::2/4
Though the carpe diem theme comes as something of a surprise, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps makes its political points, with 'moral hazard'&mdash;the dark side of second chances&mdash;the film&rsquo;s punny refrain.:::1:::3/4
Maybe "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps" doesn't pack the punch of the original because there's no revelation.:::0:::6/10
[Oliver] Stone uses a lot of visual effects to give some energy to a very conventional story...:::1:::None
Lacks the sting of recent documentaries on Wall Street's sanguine hands:::0:::None
Gordon Gekko is back, but he's not as powerful a force as he once was.:::0:::2.5/4
While the film looks as sharp as a three piece pinstripe from Bloomingdales, featuring some nice character-driven moments, its bubble bursts in an ending that feels compromised.:::0:::B-
...lest you miss the sledgehammer subtext of Stone's sequel, there are plenty of shots of bubbles blowing through the sky.:::0:::C+
Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is a flashy, timely, and mostly engaging drama, but it's really nothing without Michael Douglas, who drags Gordon Gekko out of the 'Eighties Villains Hall of Fame' for a victory lap.:::1:::3/5
Michael Douglas does what he can.:::1:::3/5
A lumbering beast that's stately where it should be nimble. Best stick with the original film.:::0:::2.5/5
Gekko's resurrection is disappointing. This isn't a savage satire on corrupt business practices. No. It's a relationship drama.:::0:::None
Somebody obviously likes David Byrne and Brian Eno, but to have every song of the movie sung by them felt like a bad 80?s comedy starring Dudley Moore, not a contemporary movie about the financial crash that had such a great impact on all of our lives.:::0:::C
There is nostalgia value in revisiting the character but, unfortunately, the picture plays like a faint echo of the original, inferior in every way. Greed just ain't good anymore.:::0:::2/5
The old Gordon Gekko would have torn this movie apart with his gleaming teeth, while today?s Gekko seems content just to nibble on the edges.:::0:::2.5/4
It?s Douglas? continuing commitment to his iconic role that sporadically gooses the proceedings, at least until a mawkish conclusion that resembles nothing so much as a Wall Street crash.:::0:::2.5/4
Advances the interesting proposition that Wall Street has become so corrupt that Gordon Gekko now seems like a hero compared to the rest of these slime balls.:::1:::B
The imagery could hardly be more heavy-handed or banal -- dominoes topple and bubbles burst but, paradoxically, the plot is hard to follow in any detail.:::0:::2/5
Money never sleeps, but you might.:::0:::2/5
It may be more than two decades since Michael Douglas won an Oscar as scheming Wall Street trader Gordon Gekko, but the character's mantra of "Greed is good" rings as loud as ever.:::1:::None
We're left with a solid if predictable drama and a whole lot of very sharp suits and New York loft apartments to envy.:::1:::3/5
The recent economic collapse would seem to offer a goldmine of opportunities for a sequel, but Stone concentrates on a dull retread of the earlier movie's deal-with-the-devil scenario...:::0:::2/4
A complete mish-mash, less bonfire than oven-lighter, a wasted opportunity...:::0:::2/5
Stone swaps fury for fun. But it sure beats another Fidel Castro interview.:::1:::3/5
Overweening showman that he is, Stone tries to give the financial mess a dramatic arc. But the sequel tries to do too many things, and a lot of them just aren?t that interesting.:::0:::5/10
After about three scenes it just sounds like blah-blah-blah, and yet the screenwriters actually create a sense of drama from this impenetrable gobbledygook.:::1:::3.5/5
There is a lot of good material, but LaBeouf nearly sinks it and we could use much more of the old Gekko brimstone.:::1:::3/5
This is a pulp novelisation of the banking crisis and its pleas for relevance ring hollow.:::0:::2/5
But whatever its critical frailties, Money Never Sleeps is again so relevant to current economics that you simply can't ignore it.:::1:::3/5
Stone assembles a competent, affectionate homage to the 1987 incarnation.:::1:::3/5
Older, wiser, and as slippery as ever, Douglas doesn't miss a trick in completing the resurrection of one of cinema's most glorious bastards.:::1:::3/5
Watchable drama enlivened by strong direction and superb performances from an excellent cast, but it's often predictable and struggles under the weight of too much plot, which ultimately drags it out to about 20 minutes longer than it ought to be.:::1:::3/5
Stone frequently trips the film up on idiosyncratic visual devices and shifting tones that make one wonder if he is making a serious drama or a slightly veiled satire:::0:::2.5/4
The lot of it is pure melodrama, but as any fan of melodrama knows, if you have a talented cast willing to throw themselves headfirst into the cinematic blender, that melodrama can be as captivating as it is cheap.:::1:::B-
An unfocused mess teetering between revenge tale, family drama, coming-of-age story, morality tale, pointed satire and nostalgic remake.:::0:::None
Interest rates may vary.:::0:::3/5
Money Never Sleeps never fails to entertain, yet there's an undercurrent of desperation inherent in the idea of even making this film.:::1:::3/5
In hindsight, Stone should have left Gekko behind bars, a casualty of his own hubris and shark-like appetites, but here he is, back on the New York streets he once owned, in 'Money Never Sleeps.' And to what end?:::0:::2/4
This is a film made for people who've lived life and lost something they've loved. It's for adults rather than just young quick buck artists.:::1:::3.5 out of 5 stars
Oliver Stone waited 23 years to make the sequel to his landmark social drama about unbridled avarice, Wall Street. Why?:::0:::None
Money may never sleep, but Oliver Stone's return to the setting of his 1987 hit 'Wall Street' gets soporific pretty quickly.:::0:::2/5
This being Oliver Stone's long-gestating, self-important sequel to Wall Street, Jake will be learning some harsh life lessons.:::0:::None
Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is a potent critique of American corporate culture in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. But as a human story, it falls flat.:::0:::2.5/5
In trying to dramatise the causes and consequences of the 2008 collapse, Stone slightly misses the boat.:::1:::3/5
Stone directs with his usual propulsive efficiency, provides a moderately gripping storyline with a ripped-from-the-headlines feel and draws effective performances from his cast, particularly La Beouf and Mulligan.:::1:::3/5
There is a fine irony to the economic meltdown being explained by the fictional patron saint of corporate shenanigans. If anyone can follow the money through this global maze of shady deals and alphabet soup loopholes, it's Gordon Gekko.:::1:::B
[As part of] Stone's rant on the financial mess foisted on us, he shoots the boardroom scenes as if the bankers are mafia dons ordering a hit on the American people.:::1:::2.5/4
I have absolutely no idea what message Stone thinks he's sending, but I'm pretty sure he still thinks greed is a bad thing.:::1:::3.5/5
...the characters are simply talking points so it's hard to get worked up about what happens to them.:::0:::2/5
In some ways Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is a modern western -- The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly on Wall Street. But in Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, the only thing left hanging is the plot.:::1:::2.5/5
A little too long but the relationship plots and the strong acting of Douglas and Langella make this a worthy sequel:::1:::7/10
The immortal Gordon Gekko is back.:::1:::3/4
[The film] is clearly anti- "destroying the economy", but isn't terrible coherent otherwise.:::0:::5/10
While the movie is nothing to rave about, the cast makes it a worthwhile viewing experience.:::1:::2.5/5
The rarest of Hollywood sequels, in that it seemingly has an artistic rather than financial motivation for its birth. And its story hinges on believable turns born of personality, not wildly fluctuating narrative convenience.:::1:::3/5
Crime might not pay, but greed is still good!:::1:::4/4
Transformers alum Shia is the protege of Decepticon Megatron Douglas - who is looking rather Megatranny these days.:::1:::B-
It's as though Stone is pulling his punches, angry at the economic state of the union but at the same time anxious to provide cinema audiences with a superior popcorn movie.:::0:::3/5
It's not a convincing family drama or rise-and-fall story, the redemption is forced, the plot twists are painfully obvious, its sluggish and preachy, offers no real insight into the current financial collapse, and worst of all--it's dreadfully boring.:::0:::1/4
Heavy-themed remake not as edgy as original.:::1:::3/5
The money may not be sleeping, but much of the audience will be following this poor investment of a film.:::0:::1/5
Presents a timely update on how Wall Street does business.:::1:::B-
When the ending feels more like 'Dan in Real Life' you know Oliver Stone and Michael Douglas went wrong somewhere in this sequel.:::0:::5/10
Wall Street 2: Take it to the Bank.:::1:::3.5/4.0
In the '80s, lighting a cigar with a $100 bill was sexy. In 2010, it's damn near porn.:::1:::3/4
This sequel -- like its iconic character -- is every bit as slick, relevant and, yes, mature as you'd want it to be.:::1:::3.5/4
Good thing for Stone that Michael Douglas slips so easily into his hair gel and Armani suit as Gordon Gekko and manages to make this warmed-over soap opera bearably entertaining.:::1:::3/5
A story that should have been told with more fire.:::0:::C+
Michael Douglas returns as an older, possibly mellower Gekko, but one with the same confident smile, the arrogant assurance, and lethal charm, played with a palpable pleasure that makes the character repugnant but infinitely fascinating:::1:::4/5
If anything, Stone has more grist for his muckraking mill now than he did 23 years ago. So why does the result feel so bland?:::1:::3/5
Stone loses his grasp of the overall narrative, minimizing the intimate authenticity and the broader themes of friendship, loyalty and betrayal that the material requires.:::0:::2.5/4
There are times when iconic characters should be left alone to bask in the glory of a single appearance and, unfortunately, that's the case with Gordon Gekko.:::1:::2.5/4
Neither knowledgeable nor intelligent about the financial mess it tries to describe, it's still entertaining because of the individual performances of Douglas, Brolin, and Culligan.:::1:::7/10
Great to see Douglas back in the role that won him an Oscar. But even when he's offscreen, he's a bigger presence than LaBeouf.:::1:::3/5
This well-oiled and flawlessly executed cinematic event lives up to all lofty expectations. It deserves one of the 10 slots as best picture of the year. For what it's worth, my advice is to...:::1:::3.5.4
It starts out as a big-stakes film attempting a grand statement about the rift lines in the machine of American capitalism. It ends up going small-time, as a miserly story about people we do not understand behaving in ways we don't believe.:::0:::3/5
For me, the basic problem with Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is simple: Oliver Stone's rage is missing this time.:::0:::2.5/4
Stone used to know in his gut that a sermon belongs in the pulpit, not the multiplex. No more.:::0:::2/4
Michael Douglas is tremendously-serpentine; Oliver Stone's direction is energetic and acute; and this sequel to their 1987 Oscar-winning original purrs with snark and style. Then the bubble bursts.:::1:::3/5
Stone's latest film Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps proves he's become a toothless old fart ready for the retirement home.:::0:::None
The kind of pointed critique of the American financial system this film might have made ends up without teeth, while the troubled personal relationships at its core are steered, without reason, towards an inexplicably treacly Hollywood ending.:::0:::3.9/10
This was an impressive undertaking that took on too much to be truly effective.:::0:::2.5/5
The film is easy enough to watch and fairly engaging, although it pales in comparison to the original. But when Douglas is in the camera's focus and his aged Gekko does his thing, it's like magic once more. (Parental Review also Available):::1:::None
Every bit as glam, entertaining, punchy and timely as the original.:::1:::None
Stone handles the financial stuff quite well.:::1:::B
If [Stone] had cut the bull and focused on the bullishness, he might have had a sequel worthy of its original.:::0:::C+
Money Never Sleeps doesn't get inside the sociopathology of the money culture. In a sense, it is a product, an expression, of that culture. Maybe that's why it's so disagreeably agreeable.:::1:::B+
[A]gainst all probability, 'Money Never Sleeps' is a watchable enough movie for its first hour or so.... But as the financial bubble pops, so too does the cinematic one.:::0:::None
The story of Jake, Winnie and Gordon makes us wonder if there is any other bedtime story so lulling, so disarming, as moviedom's falsely wrought "happily ever after.":::1:::3/5
In a perverse but amusing way, Money Never Sleeps sometimes seems like film noir for CNBC junkies.:::1:::None
I think Stone should have left Gordon Gekko where he was --- in jail!:::0:::None
Stone has never been a filmmaker to mince words, although "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps" seems to lack the fierce edge of some of his previous works, like "JFK" or "Platoon", or certainly "Natural Born Killers". Still it is fun to watch.:::1:::None
The flick is a worthy sequel that contains phenomenal performances but falls short of the first one. Some of the editing felt like a Powerpoint presentation.:::1:::3.5/5
Some welcome skulduggery ensues, but the movie's ultimate agenda of rehabilitating a classic bad guy is a big disappointment.:::0:::None
Not enough Gordan Gekko! 'Money Never Sleeps' is like watching two hours straight of CNBC, which is great if that is your channel of choice, but not a triumph for a feature-length film.:::0:::C
This is not a great film, but if you can accept Stone's submission to the dictates of the popcorn movie romance, I think there's a lot to like.:::1:::None
An enlivening and rather wickedly entertaining take on the occasional angels -- but mostly demons -- that ran the country into financial ruin.:::1:::3.5/5
It should be an electrifying tale of love and loss set against the turbulent economic crash of 2008, but instead there's a whole lot of smoke without real fire, and while it's entertaining enough, you'll undoubtedly still leave the cinema disappointed.:::0:::3/5
... it's Douglas who makes Stone's sequel worth a watch ...:::1:::3/5
Stone is to be commended for showing the high-stakes world of Wall Street without glamorizing it, even if his approach is at times heavy-handed.:::0:::2/4
A great vehicle for Shia LaBeouf, Josh Brolin and Michael Douglas that occasionally disappoints but crackles more often than it fizzles.:::1:::4/5
Gekko has lost a step or two in the 23-year span between the original and now. He's still an untrustworthy slime ball, but one that is too predictable.:::1:::3.5/5
It's sort of adorable and sort of terrifying to... see the ultimate 80s icon of sharky, sociopathic greed -- Gordon Gekko -- reduced to an object of quaint amusement...:::1:::None
Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is the kind of movie Stone could set-up in his sleep...and a lot of the time, it looks like he did.:::0:::2.5/5
Oliver Stone bathes his boardrooms in the glossy sheen of deceit. Strong performances by Michael Douglas and Shia LaBeouf make this fun, if not quite riveting.:::1:::B+
Plot heavy follow-up delivers enough to satisfy sequel-eager fans.:::1:::3/5
While Douglas continues to be enough to make the entire movie worth watching, there is little chemistry with LeBoeuf or between LeBoeuf and Mulligan.:::1:::B
Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps feels like a genuine continuation of the original story, rather than the parodic spoof some might assume. It is also one of the best directed films of the year.:::1:::8/10
Saddled with this hollow script, Stone pads with elaborate set pieces.:::0:::2/4
Stone isn't a details guy; he's all about grand pronouncements, and his opinion here is that the collapse of 2008 cost everyday Americans their innocence as well as their homes and pensions.:::0:::2/5
This movie is by turns brilliant and dumb, naive and wise, nowhere near good enough and something close to great.:::1:::3.5/5
Subtlety has never been Stone's strong suit, but few filmmakers pick at our rawest societal scabs with quite as much brio and determination.:::1:::4/5
LaBeouf seems unclear as to how to play all this.:::0:::2/4
The movie fails because we don't get enough Gekko. I feel like I was promised a steak, and ended up getting a salad!:::0:::1/4
It's a wholly successful sequel -- audacious, entertaining and bracingly pertinent.:::1:::3.5/4
Give Stone credit for great timing, sparkling dialogue and vivid characters, but debit him for pouring it on too thick.:::1:::3/4
Stone and the script shortchange the characters, forcing them to do things that seem phony and having them recite lines that sound stilted and overly didactic.:::0:::None
I liked Gordon Gekko better before he turned into Paul Krugman, but in Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps he is still at his core a seductive high priest of the money-changers' temples.:::1:::2.5/4
Stone has a knack for pacing, detail and atmosphere that manages to feel authentic and fancifully allegorical at the same time.:::1:::3/4
It's like a sweater that's been pulled at from the top and bottom - it's so spread out that you can't see anything any more but the holes, even if you really wanted to admire the design.:::0:::None
full review at Movies for the Masses:::0:::2/5
The only thing worse than a movie that resorts to painful cliches is one that resorts to painful cliches that are also wildly inappropriate.:::0:::C
[Stone]'s mantra is more! more! more!, and he mounts crazy (and silly) visuals, such as red neon stock prices that dance across the screen against a backdrop of the Big Apple's most expensive toys.:::1:::B
[Gordon Gekko] turns out to be more human ... than that unapologetic, greedy, egoistic, quick-tempered, sociopathic thief we once loved to hate.:::0:::2/4
a sequel that pales in comparison to its predecessor:::0:::C-
Wider in scope than its predecessor and technically more ambitious. It's a lot of other things, too, including clumsy, obvious and safe.:::0:::2/4
This return to the financial world's most famous address is a bit like talking to a bad financial adviser - mostly boring, overly complicated, and in the end you feel a little ripped off.:::0:::2/5
There's lots of talk and very little true wisdom which, come to think of it, is also a defining characteristic of the overinflated bubble world the movie is so desperately trying to puncture.:::0:::5/10
The story certainly holds your attention, but it's a dramatic bubble about a financial bubble.:::0:::None
If you're not looking for anything particularly profound, it's entertaining, thanks to the zest of the cast and the stylish look of the film.:::1:::2.5/4
Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is a nice return to form by one of our best socially-minded filmmakers, and it works as both entertainment and polemic, no easy trick.:::1:::None
Douglas is fun to watch. Little else in this movie is.:::0:::2/4
This may work against "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps." The film, Oliver Stone's revisit to his innovative, Academy Award-winning 1987 film "Wall Street," is classy and entertaining to be sure. But its time has passed.:::1:::B+
Douglas gives Money Never Sleeps what it needs most: a defiant face to the corruption. Greed may be good, but Douglas is better.:::1:::None
It's nothing more than a series of extended HuffPo rants strung together by alternately sappy and preachy plot points that could have been as foretelling as the original film if it had come two years earlier...:::0:::2/5
The essential ingredient in movies is timing, so the return of Gordon Gekko in this compelling, if cynical sequel couldn't be more welcome.:::1:::9/10
Stone's new film expresses a more personal, intimate sense of moral hazard, which more broadly indicates the possibility that one or more parties to a contract may lie, cheat, steal or otherwise behave badly.:::1:::None
Moving as fast and recklessly as a trillion-dollar fat-finger stock-market transaction, the film has the drive, luxe and sarcastic wit of the snazziest Hollywood movies for most of its two-hours-plus running time.:::1:::None
Everyone involved with Oliver Stone's sterling sequel to his '87 classic brings their A-game.:::1:::5/5
The movie provides entertainment and catharsis in lavish dollops.:::1:::None
The film has more moving parts than a pricey Rolex, and they are not all in sync.:::0:::2.5/5
A very good movie, even if its impact falls short of its predecessor.:::1:::3/5
Eventually, Stone allows the squishy love story between Jacob and Winnie to take center stage. It's a mistake.:::0:::1.5/4
Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps tells a story that we can all relate to, God help us.:::1:::4/5
Gekko's still a wolf in wolf's clothing. The question is: How big is his hunger?:::1:::B-
The movie is short on outrage, long on character, even longer on anticlimax -- it's like heading out to a heavyweight prizefight and ending up at the avant-garde theater.:::0:::C
Stone...overreaches and ends up with a story that feels scattershot.:::0:::C+
Money Never Sleeps is diverting enough. But as a cautionary tale of personal and business ethics, the film has all the urgency of snail mail.:::0:::2/4
The film's lack of focus is almost criminal, but schadenfreude energizes Stone. Everyone here is dancing on a bubble, and no one has the guts to admit the bubble is about to pop.:::1:::2.5/4
"A topic as sexy as money should never, ever be boring.":::1:::3/5
Another edifying movie by Oliver Stone on the ethical disarray, selfishness, and cynicism of those who worship at the altar of capitalism.:::1:::3/5
The first time around, Wall Street felt like a warning about the perils of excess just as excess started to exact its toll. This one's little more than a reminder that we all got, and remain, screwed. Noted.:::0:::C
Not on par with the first film, but still worth seeing. Douglas is incredible.:::1:::7/10
The rare sequel that feels not only relevant but necessary.:::1:::None
I don't know about you, but I like my Oliver Stone straight-up, with all the lunatic delusions writhing in my face. Oddly, though, he hasn't done a full Ollie this time out.:::0:::None
Trading coke, hookers, hair gel, cigarettes, and limos for moral fiber and a worldwide warning shot seems like natural angle for this sequel to take, yet in Stone's beefy hands, the aim is as crooked as the stockbrokers.:::0:::C-
It gleams and glistens but it has no substance. It is, in the end, a missed opportunity.:::0:::3/5
The ending is a cop-out, but by then it hardly matters. You've already had much more than your money's worth.:::1:::4/5
A competent drama with topical themes and a repeat performance for one of Hollywood's most memorable characters of recent times. Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps becomes Gekko's ironic victory lap.:::1:::None
Simplistic, perfunctory, lurid and schmaltzy, Oliver Stone's sequel to his 1987 event movie, is an artistic disappointment on many levels, including the acting.:::0:::C
Great, thoughtful drama it's not, but it's sleek, fast and amusing enough to serve as the sort of high-gloss, dumb-fun melodrama that holds your interest without overtaxing your brain.:::1:::B-
While it could have been a big movie on every level, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps ultimately is small.:::1:::7/10
...bloated, obvious and - most damningly - immediately irrelevant.:::0:::1.5/4
People should care as much about Gordon Gekko's family life as they should about Hannibal Lecter's favorite vacation spots.:::0:::1.5/5
[It] has its satisfactions, thanks mainly to a cast skillful enough to finesse what is effectively two films sharing the same screen.:::1:::2.5/4
It's an entertaining story about ambition, romance and predatory trading practices, but it seems more fascinated than angry. Is Stone suggesting this new reality has become embedded, and we're stuck with it?:::1:::3/4
Oliver Stone's grandiose and sprawling sequel to Wall Street - a much anticipated film that glitters with the spoils of greed but - perhaps like money itself - doesn't really satisfy.:::0:::2.5/5
A swift and engaging financial thriller (is that a thing?) that addresses matters of morality without too much moralizing.:::1:::B
LaBeouf's intimate scenes with Mulligan are convincing and affecting - if you don't cry when the banks collapse you will when the lovebirds fight.:::1:::3/5
By making Wall Street Money Never Sleeps a nice romance/patriarchal drama set against the bulls-&-bears world of high-finance, Stone has let the GFC off far too lightly and largely ignored the legacy of Gordon Gekko.:::0:::None
Stone is a great technical director, and he uses his skill to excellent effect here. He loads the screen with information - montages of cable-news reports, stock listings, more, more, more.:::1:::3.5/5
Stone loves to throw himself into the macho bloodiness of a cinematic fray. That's his strength. But here he also wants to murmur a trite and pious lullaby about how children-are-our-real-wealth, la la la.:::0:::C+
Money Never Sleeps isn't an epic masterpiece like Stone's World Trade Center, but it's often amazingly vivid.:::1:::None
Very enjoyable but maybe less fun than its predecessor.:::1:::4/5
A dizzying, jargon-strewn tangle of plotlines each of which are forced forward with an unmodulated, cadence-free abandon that often looks as though Michael Bay was directing.:::0:::1/5
An honourable failure as escapist entertainment.:::0:::2.5/5
Money Never Sleeps is never boring, even as its plot descends into cheap melodrama and the script runs out of banter about the "the NINJA generation -- no income, no job, no assets.":::1:::2.5/4
Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is a movie only a hedge fund manager could love.:::0:::2/4
Stone jazzes up the dry proceedings with fancy filmic footwork, but even he is no match for derivatives.:::0:::2/4
The undeniably polished and professional work of a once-iconoclastic filmmaker who appears to be mellowing with age. I liked him better when he was ruthless.:::1:::2.5/4
Douglas is having a ball in his signature role, and Stone gets many of the details right. Yet the movie, lazy to begin with, slackens once all the daddy issues come into play.:::1:::3/5
The time is right for the return of Gordon Gekko, but making him a sidekick in a convoluted revenge plot, loaded with GFC history and allusions, stifles his totemic comeback. Less might well have been more, Mr Stone.:::0:::3
there's no revelation to these blunt, garish, perfunctory proceedings, only "timely" moralizing:::0:::2/4
Oliver Stone wages a valiant attempt to stay true to his original "Wall Street's" streamlined storytelling about the warped mentality at the center of the capitalist world.:::1:::B+
A spectacularly well made film without any real answers, and a lot of questions which have already been asked.:::1:::4/5
Just like the Stock Market, this movie suffers from some pretty scary highs and lows.:::0:::None
[An] unwieldy mixed bag.:::0:::None
Overstays its welcome at 133 minutes. All four lead actors play their parts admirably, but the story lacks the zing of the original.:::0:::None
Stone is never content to just make one movie; he always makes several, then squeezes them all together into one engorged package.:::0:::None
Unfortunately, whether Stone admits it or not, the 1987 original is not a good movie -- Michael Douglas' iconic Oscar-winning performance notwithstanding -- and this sequel, timely as it is, suffers from similar issues.:::0:::None
While a rock solid piece of entertainment, this may have been something special if the focus had been shifted to Gordon Gekko.:::1:::None
As with many recent Stone projects, it's hard to tell what the focus is supposed to be.:::0:::None
Galifianakis [is] able to turn on a dime; balancing his disarming humour with moments of anguished outbreaks. His is one of the best supporting performances of recent memory; equally funny and heartbreaking. If only I could say the same of the movie.:::0:::2.5/5
For all its problems, though, the film is easy-going, frequently channels into a sweet-natured tone and is able to raise a few chuckles.:::1:::3/5
It may not be One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but it's also not Patch Adams.:::0:::2/5
...runs out of steam about half way through but with a likable cast and an interesting setup you'll want to finish what you started.:::1:::None
It's also a kind of two-dimensional romance, a kind of flippant look at life on a mental ward, and (...) kind of made me want to give Zach Galifianakis a hug.:::0:::2.5/5
It's Kind of a Funny Story lacks substance, but after you've spent a short time in this ward, you have to agree with Craig: These crazies aren't so bad.:::1:::2.5/4
The film's central element -- its sensitive exploration of a young teen's emotional confusion -- creates strong audience empathy, however, and gives Fleck and Boden a fertile focus for their signature light-hearted humanist storytelling.:::1:::None
Wavering between affecting dramedy and goofy asylum- com, this is an enjoyable but superficial placebo that soft-soaps the realities of psychological disorder.:::1:::3/5
[A] flimsy, box-ticking quirk fest.:::0:::2/5
As a self-help sitcom, it feels both glib and icky. Glicky?:::0:::2/5
In the end, like the instantly-forgettable title, it's kind of neither one thing nor the other and certainly no match for the likes of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest or even Girl, Interrupted.:::0:::2/5
Boden and Fleck expertly negotiate the fine line between sunny optimism and deepest despair, as Craig's emergence into a renewed love for life is offset by the rather different kind of departure that is delicately hinted for another main character.:::1:::None
This boy doesn't need therapy or happy pills but a large slap round the chops.:::0:::None
No it's not. It's kind of a rubbish story.:::0:::1/5
As disposable as a paper cup and, for such promising directors, a serious regression.:::0:::2/5
It's a fine teen film - and how often do you see those words in the same sentence?:::1:::4/5
A pleasant movie, but no more.:::1:::3/5
It kind of isn't.:::0:::2/5
I'm pretty sure if I'd seen this movie when I was 17, I would have loved it.:::1:::B-
In the end, the title of the film contains an irony that may be lost on the filmmakers: this is kind of a funny story, no more, no less.:::1:::4/5
Agonizingly trite:::0:::None
Normally, when you have a story in which three of the main characters suffer from depression and are suicidal, you would not expect the movie to be particularly funny or uplifting. This is an exception.:::1:::B
Has a genuine understanding of the protagonist, but ends up betraying him.:::0:::2.5/5
Hardly funny.:::0:::C
It's a neat comedy without being a neat and tidy comedy.:::1:::3.5/5
The journey is aided immeasurably by the casting of Keir Gilchrist as young Craig. He has dark, sensitive eyes and a probity about him that wins you to his side.:::1:::3/4
Here is the most uplifting, quirky film I've seen in a long time. It brought me joy.:::1:::3.5/4
Writing and directing partners Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck have come up with a smart little film, a gentle drama with both an embraceable tone and a refreshing optimism.:::1:::3/4
Even though the film is somewhat mopey, it's also packed with great moments.:::1:::3/5
kind of funny, kind of touching, kind of moving, kind of odd, kind of quirky, and kind of lots of other thing, but, it's never fully anything:::0:::2.5/4
[S]weet and good-natured but too mild and timid to have any real impact...:::0:::None
The title kind of says it all:::1:::B
The people most out of touch with reality are not those onscreen, but the people behind the camera who think this film is a reflection of coping with depression.:::0:::2.5/5
Enjoyable comedy/drama with an engaging script, appealing characters, a superb soundtrack and terrific central performances from Keir Gilchrist and Zach Galifianakis.:::1:::3/5
Fleck and Boden have basically taken all of the progress they made between films 1 and 2 and dramatically reversed the process for their mainstream debut.:::0:::None
The title of 'best movie ever set in a mental hospital' remains firmly secure with 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.':::0:::1.5/5
Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden, the film's co-writing-directing team, are too principled to tip the film into the slacker reaches of sorrow.:::1:::B
...sort of upper-middle class Precious, an emo flick for self-indulgent white kids who have considered suicide when the rainbow is enuf.:::1:::86/100
Low-key adolescent angst, marred by the type of brief fantasy shots and sequences (the characters as rock stars, lip-synching 'Under Pressure') that have become a let's-go-for-an-easy-laugh crutch for filmmakers.:::0:::2.5/4
Zach G.is the next Bill Murray.:::1:::3/4
It's a less anguished, much funnier 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'...:::1:::3/4
...able to honestly juggle mental illness and a sense of hope.:::1:::3/4
A rich and unusual film that really defies categorization.:::1:::4.5/5
The writing-directing team of Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden have created a solid mix of serious, darker scenes and flights of fancy.:::1:::3/4
The acting is strong, with Galifianakis doing an especially good job as the likeable Bobby.:::1:::3/4
Is that the best approach to take about a subject as heady as mental illness, especially at a time when there are more kids on Zoloft than Flintstones? chewables?:::0:::2.5/4
Where?s Nurse Ratched when you really need her?:::0:::1.5/4
Call it "Cuckoo Light" with a PG 13-appropriate amount of angst and just enough laughs and creativity to keep your attention.:::1:::7.1/10
It?s no "One Flew Over the Cuckoo?s Nest," but this little dramedy about life in a Brooklyn psych ward has its small charms.:::1:::3/4
Genuine moments of discovery exist between modest Craig and inquisitive Noelle a-la Cameron Frye and Sloane Peterson, with a touch of The Breakfast Club mixed in...:::1:::B
Disappointingly facile... despite an understated, observant turn from Galifianakis.:::0:::2.5/5
It's Kind of a Funny Story proves Zach Galifianakis is more than just a bearded clown - but he needs to seek out better scripts.:::0:::2/4
Zack Galafianakis delivers a surprisingly emotional yet awkwardly funny performance in a film that rides that fine line of drama and comedy. I left with a smile on my face.:::1:::3.5/5
This is a strange failing for the tag team who has handled the wounded so well in previous outings.:::1:::2.5/4
Weird. And disappointing.:::0:::C-
It's not great, but the good outweighs the bad.:::1:::2.5/4
It's Kind of a Funny Story manages to affirm the good things in life without ever whitewashing the bad.:::1:::3.5/5
Coming-of-age dramedy explores teen pressures, angst.:::1:::3/5
.. the film isn't original, the star is flat, and, perhaps most damaging of all, we never really get the sense that Craig's problems are anything other than a normal teen's.:::0:::C
The message is contradictory at best and dangerous at worst, though it seems that Boden and Fleck at least intended to make a life-affirming film.:::0:::None
It's not a film, it's a bland, overly long sitcom straining for the funny ... something along the lines of Two and A Half Men-tal Cases.:::0:::3/10
Respected indie filmmakers with a niche in social-realist drama try their hand at winsome comedy, fall flat on their critically acclaimed faces.:::0:::D+
Like a short course of intelligence-numbing anti-depressants: Though it may make you feel temporarily better, it's probably not worth the icky aftertaste.:::0:::2/4
Disarmingly gentle, sweet and whimsical.:::1:::3/4
Ken Kesey is probably rolling over in his grave somewhere, but once you get past the faux-psychiatry trappings, It's Kind of a Funny Story isn't a bad little comedy.:::1:::7.5/10
The third time is charmless for writers/directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck.:::0:::2.5/5
Writer-directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck fail to energize their mild-mannered, overly pat material.:::0:::2/5
Despite the pleasant, loopy energy and fine performances -- Galiflanakis conjures a surprisingly sad character, and I grew fond of Gilchrist, with his impenetrable black eyes and rosebud mouth -- you walk out of it shaking your head.:::1:::None
So many elements, from its setup to scenes of therapy sessions and hallway high jinks, seem as canned as the blandest dayroom Muzak.:::0:::1.5/4
Co-directors Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden, who directed the gritty indie dramas Half Nelson and Sugar, go all gooey and sentimental here.:::0:::2/4
A funny and warm film that addresses its serious issues with sensitivity but refuses to become bogged down in somberness.:::1:::B
It's easy to see why the reviews out of Toronto were unkind -- this is easily cast as trivial stuff. But I think its easygoing charm has a lot to recommend it.:::1:::B
Fails to achieve much resonance in its projected tone but occasionally stumbles upon a more apropos one.:::0:::2.5/4
Throw in solid performances, a terrific script with witty and spot-on dialogue, and plenty of creative directorial flourishes and this comes off as a winning offering. (Parental Review also Available):::1:::None
Witty and imaginative fantasy sequences that make the unabashed decency and kindness at its heart even more touching.:::1:::B+
Aided by solid performances, this offbeat comedy lives up to its title, though it could have stepped a little farther out on the ledge.:::1:::B+
In the way that it really listens to and seems to understand its teen characters, it's clear that writer-directors Boden and Fleck share a real affinity for John Hughes.:::1:::3/4
You?ve heard of "Little Miss Sunshine?" "It?s Kind of a Funny Story" is more like "Little Mister Rain Cloud.":::0:::B-
Mental illness is not inherently funny. But people acting crazy can be.:::1:::3/4
The film itself is fairly slight: I'm not sure what it adds up to. Still, I enjoyed every moment...:::1:::None
Above all, Fleck and Boden break the fourth wall brilliantly and frequently, and that inventiveness is one of the film's great charms.:::1:::3.5/5
... limp and phony and cute, smothered in fantasy sequences... depicting serious mental illness as a series of charming quirks or stick-on makeup scars, peddling the same tired obligatory but-wait-maybe-it's-we-who-are-the-crazy-ones cliches.:::0:::2/5
Galifianakis is a comic force of nature, but he digs down here and delivers a beautifully nuanced performance that gets under your skin. Just like the movie.:::1:::3/4
From start to finish, It's Kind of a Funny Story walks an uncommonly deft line: Playful comedy gives way to moments of shockingly immediate and honest emotion.:::1:::None
If a movie about schizophrenia, delusion and attempted suicide can be called pleasant, even mild-mannered, this is that movie.:::1:::2.5/4
Amiable enough, but ephemeral...raises some serious issues, but treats them so fitfully that in the end it barely registers on an emotional level.:::0:::C+
there's a deficit of youthful vitality, sincerity and insight to be felt here:::0:::1.5/5
The lightest Cuckoo's Nest imaginable.:::1:::3/5
The plot isn't all that original and the movie isn't all that flawless, but It's Kind of a Funny Story has a sweet and sincere quality that won me over.:::1:::3/4
One minute a quirky comedy, and the next a bleak drama, It?s Kind of a Funny Story becomes so stifled by its identity crisis that it fails to make a lasting impression.:::0:::2.5/5
It's always dangerous for a film that doesn't quite work to carry a title that allows wordplay. So it is with It's Kind of a Funny Story, which invites the response -- "Not Really.":::0:::2.5/4
Few studio directors would be able to bring the warmly democratic touch to this subject that Fleck and Boden manage without even seeming to try. At the same time, you sort of wish they'd tried harder.:::1:::2.5/4
It's Kind of a Funny Story, though often played for laughs, mostly avoids the trap of the schtick.:::1:::None
If there's a psych ward for motion pictures, It's Kind of a Funny Story should check itself in. Boden and Fleck's film suffers from bipolar disorder: manic and silly one minute, moody and muted the next.:::0:::2.5/4
Though engaging and sweet, with a nice feel for the purgatory-like blankness of mental hospital life, It's Kind Of A Funny Story suffers from a serious, if not quite fatal, attack of the cutes.:::1:::B-
It?s kind of a phony story, as well.:::0:::1.5/4
Graced by appealing newcomer Keir Gilchrist and augmented by a heartbreaking serio-comic Zach Galifianakis, this junior-level Cuckoo's Nest is smart and sensitive.:::1:::3/4
It isn?t terrible, it is merely "mostly decent" with occasional drifts into the territory of good and, with equal measure, nauseatingly trite:::0:::C
It's Kind of a Funny Story, divided into neat little daylong chapters in Craig's stay, lacks the staying power and bittersweet layering of Half Nelson and Sugar. Yet it holds together.:::1:::3/4
Black comedy and teen romance don?t usually work this well together.:::1:::3.5/5
Uncommonly brainy, fun and compassionate for the teen genre.:::1:::3.5/5
The densely built and bearded Galifianakis demonstrates, in an impressive display of quieter dramatic skills, that he knows when to dial it down.:::1:::B
It's Kind of a Funny Story really isn't so funny. Cute, bordering on cutesy, yes. Light and shallow and inconsequential in a lot of ways. But funny? Rarely.:::0:::2/4
You won't need a frontal lobotomy to enjoy the simple and even kind of funny pleasures to be found here.:::1:::3/4
The kid's problems are less interesting than the whackos surrounding him, but that prevents the movie's coming-of-age narrative from becoming too pat: like the space between comedy and drama, the one between sanity and insanity is where real life [is].:::1:::None
In a culture where children and their feelings often seem to run roughshod over the adult world, it's a relief to get a snapshot of a mixed-up middle-class kid who comes to realize just how manageable his problems really are.:::1:::7.5/10
An eager beaver of a picture, looking to treat mental illness with a preciousness that often burns like shock treatment.:::0:::C
The filmmakers adroitly sidestep the cliches of the insane-asylum genre. However, the determinedly low-key style requires a patience that isn?t always rewarded.:::1:::None
It's the worst kind of post-ironic, my-week-of-healing dramedy, set in an NYC mental ward in which cute patients flirt, tease and scamper around hallways like runaways in a John Hughes film.:::0:::2/5
I used to think art was just bourgeois decadence, a wiser Craig says in the end, which is funny, because thats kind of what this film is.:::0:::None
Galifianakis does particularly nice, understated work...But, ultimately, the film is disappointingly insubstantial.:::0:::None
Boden and Fleck's competent, bland aesthetics do little more than occasionally amplify their material's cloying sentimentality.:::0:::1.4
A depressed teenage boy checks himself into a psych ward in this modest but good-hearted comedy.:::1:::None
It's teen-psychology-super-drama-lite. The funny thing is that is does have some genuinely moving moments.:::1:::B-
Bottom line? Kind of a funny story.:::1:::B
Strives for a sensitively crafted story through the prism of adolescent angst, and the bittersweet vibe of raucous inmates taking over the asylum - when not engaging in lunatic breakfast burrito wars - that is not so bad either.:::1:::None
Zack Galifianakis steals the show at every turn, giving his first ever three-dimensional performance and earning the attention he's been getting.:::1:::3/5
A magical movie about a five-day stay in a psychiatric hospital that gives a depressed fifteen-year old a new lease on life.:::1:::3/5
...a breezy piece of work that does what it sets out to do with charm and aplomb.:::1:::2.5/4
Best left for the festival circuit -- which is where we suffer through the indie-style artifice so you don't have to.:::0:::2/5
Broader, bigger and more traditional than Boden and Fleck's previous work-- and unfortunately, significantly less successful.:::0:::None
Zach Galifianakis steals tere aren't many surprises here.:::0:::2/4
I laughed here and there at She's Out of My League, but I sort of hated everything it had to say about nerds and babes and the sliding scale of self-image.:::0:::2/4
The movie is not a comedy classic. But in a genre where so many movies struggle to lift themselves from zero to one, it's about, oh, a six point five.:::1:::3/4
There's an interesting, funny, quietly devastating film to be made from the core idea here -- that of an average guy so convinced of his unworthiness that he subconsciously sabotages a golden romantic opportunity -- but this overly broad exercise in set-p:::0:::1.5/5
[A] one-joke sub-Judd Apatow snark-athon...:::0:::C
The movie is convincing enough to give every Kirk in the world a semblance of hope. Every once in a while, love really is blind.:::1:::None
What elevates She's Out of My League -- it doesn't turn a 5 into a 10, but it helps -- is heart, of which its characters have a surprising plenty.:::1:::3.5/5
The promising material, penned by the writers of the underrated Sex Drive, skews closer to Farrelly brothers slapstick than sweetness.:::1:::3/5
She's Out of My League is that rare modern screen comedy that is better than the trailers make it appear.:::1:::None
This appealingly cast movie seesaws from unlikely thoughtfulness to imbecilic vulgarity.:::0:::None
:::1:::3/5
:::1:::3/4
There are some decent performances here, particularly from Jill Scott, but they just can't save the cliched material from weighing down the whole film.:::0:::1.5/4
Tyler Perry's worst film.:::0:::3/10
Hopelessly inert and dreary.:::0:::1/5
Perry has plugged a hole in the market, for sure; it's just all a bit pleased with itself.:::0:::2/5
Go to see it and you may ask yourself why did I bother?:::0:::2/5
Fans of utter predictability will be well satisfied.:::0:::1/5
Even a scene with Janet Jackson trashing a living room cannot lighten the laboured atmosphere.:::0:::1/5
Undermined by its inability to stand separately from its predecessor.:::0:::2/5
Sometimes shrill, always uneven...:::0:::2/5
It becomes clear why Oprah is such a huge Perry fan.:::0:::2/5
It's gone way past film bad -- all the way to crime bad, and personally I'd put the act of making Why Did I Get Married Too? on a level with seven burglaries.:::0:::1/5
Basically, it's Barbershop with bigger bucks.:::0:::2/5
The story is relentlessly bland and the script constantly panders to its family values-obsessed audience, neutering all the characters in the process.:::0:::2/5
Finding this occasionally over the top nasty domestic strife entertaining, depends on whether you have a tendency to put your nosy ears closer to the wall when married neighbors squabble loudly, or would rather cover them up for the annoying duration.:::0:::None
Renaissance Man Tyler Perry proving he still has his finger on the pulse via yet another, madcap, marital melodrama apt to resonate with the collective conscious of the black community.:::1:::4/4
One trip to this well was enough. The cast, returning from the first film, is good enough but the story is shrill and unnerving. By the time a tacky ending arrives the audience is ready for something a little lighter and a little brighter.:::0:::2/4
Perry doesn't pander to critics. His intent is to make positive films about black family life. Some filmmakers like to push buttons, like Spike Lee or Lee Daniels. Perry's morals and values, regardless of art, will always come first.:::0:::C
Not as clever or as dramatic as the first outing, 'Why Did I Get Married Too?' still is an enjoyable outing for the ensemble created by Tyler Perry.:::1:::3/4
It shows a maturing in Perry's work from the pandering of his men-are-all-dogs films.:::1:::2.5/4
Like most of Perry's treasures, Why Did I Get Married Too? seems to have been shot with no script and on a single take; the majority of dialogue overheard at your local mall's food court is leagues more entertaining.:::0:::1/4
I suppose it was inevitable in our post-Tiger Woods world that the golf club should be added to the Perry arsenal of womanly rage.:::0:::2/5
Burdened with a bevy of unlikely plot twists, this is less a movie sequel than the latest installment in a big-screen soap opera.:::0:::2/5
Another sure moneymaker but this is a weak effort from the Tyler Perry machine:::0:::5/10
Easygoing effort at times feels over-baked and too full of Perry's now-trademarked melodramatics.:::0:::2.5/5
Love heals in mature, melodramatic marriage dramedy.:::0:::2/5
Not only is Perry in tune with his audience as always, he's unquestionably growing as a cinematic artist.:::1:::3/5
Perry is getting closer to striking the right balance between comedy and drama, mining deep, sometimes disturbing emotional territory in this sequel.:::1:::None
Perry seems to be going through the motions on this one, repeating the platitudes and relationship angst that he's trotted out a half-dozen times already.:::0:::C-
Another Perry film that is certainly flawed but well-worth the watch.:::1:::B-
If Perry's cinematic vision remains less than 20/20, his sagacity gets stronger by the movie.:::1:::2.5/4
This Tyler Perry sequel hews closer to his usual formula than its predecessor, but good cast chemistry and a gutturally fierce performance by Janet Jackson keep it watchable.:::1:::B-
Worth mentioning is the queasy dynamic in which the male characters' violent impulses are condemned in theory but, when acted on, seem to be implicitly excusehe picture as the chronically dysfunctional but eminently wise Bobby, who teaches the adolescent how to like himself. Warts and all.:::1:::3/4
Although this film is a big departure stylistically for Boden and Fleck, you can see where they are trying to bring much the same sensibility to the direction of It's Kind of a Funny Story that they brought to Half Nelson and Sugar.:::1:::None
The filmmakers fully retain their offbeat sensibility and attentiveness to character while providing perhaps the sharpest showcase yet for Zach Galifianakis' outsized talents.:::1:::None
Paints a mental hospital as a charming place for a teen to come of age. Incredible that the directors of HALF-NELSON could get this so wrong.:::0:::5/10
A dramatically inert, lethargic dramedy that isn't nearly as quirky and poignant is it perceives itself.:::0:::None
I was so embarrassed, so uncomfortable with the total lack of recognizable human behavior in the film that I strongly debated getting up and leaving.:::0:::None
:::1:::B+
:::1:::4/5
It's a film about cancer, but it never succumbs to the morose trappings of its cinematic cousins ... it's done with such a subtle grace that it's easy to forget your heart is being tugged at by filmmakers.:::1:::None
An honest, earnest and powerful look at a young person's battle with cancer.:::1:::5.0/5
Even with all its faults, it's pretty difficult not to be won over.:::1:::B
It's a brave plan to make a cancer movie that's moving, uplifting and pant-wettingly funny. But against the odds, it's definitely a case of remission accomplished.:::1:::4/5
Wonderfully played, with a marvelous humanity about it.:::1:::3/4
50/50 is a thoughtful and challenging story, grounded in real world characters, that also manages rewarding and cathartic laughs.:::1:::4/5
50/50 is smartly written and well acted enough to have you fully invested once it's time to find out if those titular odds come good.:::1:::3/5
In a world where we are either given silly comedies or serious dramas, Jonathan Levine manages to bring both together in perfect harmony for 50/50.:::1:::10/10
50/50 is funny, sweet, moving, well acted and touching story of friendship.:::1:::4/5
The tears are earned, no small thanks to the touching performances.:::1:::3.5/4
A powerfully empathetic performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt saves 50/50 from succumbing to the annoying presence of Seth Rogen and his hophead propagandizing.:::1:::3/5
...a Gen-Y Terms of Endearment that bullseyes both the existential dilemma and piercing clarity that cancer sufferers experience.:::1:::None
For all of the attention 50/50 has gotten for being the 'cancer comedy', it's received not nearly enough praise for being so moving and emotionally satisfying.:::1:::4/5
Deeply affecting and admirably even-keeled...:::1:::3.5/4
Gordon-Levitt turns depression and despair into comedy of the edgiest kind, while making his character all the more sympathetic for his occasional outbursts of anger and aggression.:::1:::None
Todo esta muy bien observado por el guionista Will Reiser con pinceladas de humor muy efectivo (casi siempre gentileza de Seth Rogen, que hace el mismo personaje de siempre y lo hace barbaro) y tambien con algunas cuotas de emocion esperables.:::1:::3/5
This film is thin.:::0:::None
Will Reiser's emotionally rich script -- which is based on his own battle with cancer -- never hits a wrong note, and he finds the comedy in Adam's life as easily as the drama.:::1:::3/4
Dark humor, smart characters and a script with a heart make '50/50' one of the best films of the year. You'll take some emotions with you when you leave the theater.:::1:::3.5/4
[A]n honest, hilarious, laugh-till-you-cry look at how very much it sucks to get very sick as a young person... The characters are all uniquely vivid and unforgettable...:::1:::None
To those unfortunate enough to have a potentially terminal illness, it could be inspirational.:::1:::3/5
[A] beautifully played, precisely observed and surprisingly thoughtful buddy movie, which is based on a true story.:::1:::4/5
It's the performances that really make it work, with Seth Rogen bringing his usual wonderfully loose comic energy to proceedings.:::1:::4/5
The absence of self-pity and sentimentality is something of a change. The women involved, however, are given a rather hard time.:::1:::None
This frequently funny and moving film proves humour can be wrung from tricky subjects, providing it's done with sufficient thoughtfulness and wit.:::1:::3/5
This film leaves a strange taste in the mouth.:::0:::1/5
Gordon-Levitt's uptight everyman hero fully earns our sympathy and Kendrick is superb as the rookie therapist, but the film suffers from an overly strong dose of Rogen's crudity and mawkishness, which must surely be reaching its use-by date soon.:::1:::None
So well-meaning you want to hug it.:::1:::3/5
The picture scores highly for tackling tricky, thought-provoking subject matter and contains some humorous and touching moments.:::1:::3/5
A rom-com with brains that - at key moments - feels as sly and sweet as Annie Hall.:::1:::4/5
It's not a major landmark on anybody's resume, but it's nothing to be ashamed of either.:::1:::3/5
The Gordon-Levitt-Rogen bromance is one of the most exciting and fun ones in recent comedy history, and the pair have a wonderful natural rift ...:::1:::4/5
Seth Rogen might be there to puts bums on seats, but it's Joseph Gordon-Levitt who will keep you watching.:::1:::3/5
It may be a marketing nightmare, but as examinations of mortality go, few come funnier, wiser or more astutely acted.:::1:::4/5
50/50 is about right.:::1:::3/5
Whether you're after a comedy-drama about cancer or a Rogen laugh-fest with added heart, this does a remarkable job of balancing the odds.:::1:::4/5
This is the terminal illness weepie for people who don't watch terminal illness weepies, and it's much the better for it.:::1:::4/5
It's refreshing to see a movie that embraces the ugly side of what happens to complicated personal relationships. Its quite uncomfortable at times, and the frank exploration of the cancer patient journey makes the comedy even funnier.:::1:::3/4
It is tough to make a comedy about cancer, since it touches us all. It is not funny. When you have Seth Rogen in a film, however, anything can be funny.:::1:::B
The elements of 50/50 that do work are strong enough to carry the film along and affecting enough to bring losers like me to tears in their cinema seats.:::1:::None
Tackles a distressing subject with a healthy dose of humour, thanks to a sharply observed script, well-rounded, likeable characters, astute direction and a trio of terrific performances from Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Seth Rogen and Anna Kendrick.:::1:::4/5
There couldn't be a more serious subject, yet Gordon-Levitt and especially Rogen (who co-produced the movie) make the comedy seem both spontaneous and organic.:::1:::None
Nimbly switching gears between heartful drama and uproarious comedy, 50/50 tackles the near-impossible and makes a film about cancer that'll have you crying like a baby one minute and laughing so hard your sides hurt the next.:::1:::4.5/5
Jonathan Levine directs a film that may be one of the year's best but still makes one yearn for the serious and uncompromising films of the 1950s and 1960s.:::1:::7/10
Yes, cancer can be funny. Sort of.:::1:::B
Films about cancer aren't generally this funny. And while this movie isn't a comedy, beyond its generous dose of realistic humour, it has a smart, personal script that dares to face a difficult situation head on.:::1:::4/5
Life is hard. Cancer is hard. Relationships are hard. Family is hard. '50/50' managed to find the power in all of those things and give us plenty of laughs so we're not simply in a ball crying.:::1:::9/10
A near-great movie made out of the hardest-to-thread, most oxymoronic genre imaginable - "cancer comedy.":::1:::4.5/5
a good movie with a moderate sense of daring that ultimately spends too much time telling the wrong story:::0:::2.5/4
With its excellent cast and emotionally intelligent script, 50/50 isn't necessarily a feel good movie about cancer, but is an exceptional telling of one man's story, mixed with a perfect balance of sympathy and laughs.:::1:::4/5
Interesting commentary on how we deal with difficult situations, and makes a strong case for our desperate need for each other -- especially when the odds are stacked against us.:::1:::2.5/4
... surprisingly funny, while also honestly poignant and dramatic.:::1:::4/5
...one of the unexpected pleasures of the fall movie season.:::1:::4/5
"50/50" is a tear jerker film that has me calling it one of the best films of 2011.:::1:::5/5
Add 50/50 to your want to see list. And then make an appointment for your annual physical with your doctor.:::1:::None
Even with its flaws and age limits, 50/50 isn't half bad.:::1:::3/5
50/50 is noble in its own way but not especially affecting. In its homey style and jokiness it's as comfortable as an old shoe, and I don't know that a movie about cancer should be comfortable.:::1:::3/5
You'll walk out a stronger person than you were when you went in.:::1:::None
50/50 is not just another crude piece of mockery. Crude at times, yes, but at its occasionally uneven soul is a very funny and bluntly moving tale of living within the fringes of potential death.:::1:::3/4
Doesn't even quite pull off 'very good,' but it easily walks off with a solid 'good.' And in 2011, good may be good enough.:::1:::4/5
Swapping out the usual relationship tangle for a cancer-centric plot, 50/50 feels like this year's (500) Days Of Summer.:::1:::4/5
Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance is heartbreaking and inspiring.:::1:::A-
As honest as [screenwriter Will Reiser] could make it within the parameters of an uplifting crowd-pleaser.:::1:::7/10
[The filmmakers] tap into the wonderful complexity of the material: Cancer is awful, but it's instructive and loving and funny, too.:::1:::None
Not the comedy I expected but instead a well acted but depressing film.:::1:::6/10
Cancer patient questions his life in mature dramedy.:::1:::4/5
50/50 keeps the highs high. That's easy. Keeping the lows high is much more tricky. The lows are where most dying-of-a-disease movies go to die.:::1:::4.5/5
Funny, heartfelt, well-acted and refreshingly honest. It's one of the best movies of the year.:::1:::9.19/10
Amazingly upbeat and comical despite realistically depicting what it's like to know you have only a 50/50 chance of surviving a rare cancer.:::1:::B
As Adam in 50/50, Gordon-Levitt is low-key, but very human. His expressive face shines and darkens. Director Jonathan Levine brings him back to simple, expressive humanity.:::1:::2.5/5
'50/50' plays cancer for laughs.:::1:::B plus
50/50 centers around a cancerous presence, and that refers to Seth Rogen as much as it does to the malignant tumor found on the spine of Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Carve Rogen out of the picture, and its chances of being a truly moving film increase.:::1:::2.5/4
Emotionally cathartic serio-comedy, ending on a convincingly upbeat note.:::1:::8/10
A good cancer movie should make you both laugh and cry, and 50/50 did exactly that for me.:::1:::4/5
If you are open to the experience of a 'Cancer Movie,' this is a pretty good one. It's funny where it should be funny, dramatic where it should be dramatic. It doesn't try too hard to wring the tears out of you. (Movie Review for Parents also available):::1:::None
50/50 isn&rsquo;t interested in defeatism, except as one inevitable way station of the film&rsquo;s appealing emotional ramble.:::1:::3/4
If you want to draw some life lessons from it all, go ahead: That's your choice, and it's easy to do. But '50/50' isn't going to beat you about the head with it.:::1:::4/4
Still, it's Gordon-Levitt's choices that continue to impress. Sure, he owned one of the most jaw-dropping sequences in last summer's blockbuster Inception. But the actor remains drawn to profoundly human-scale hurts and quiet triumphs.:::1:::2.5/4
Gordon-Levitt is an agreeably undemonstrative actor who plays well opposite the burbly Rogen.:::1:::B-
Chances are about 90/10 that you'll enjoy 50/50.:::1:::B+
Mixing humor and painful subject matter is, naturally, very difficult. The beauty of this movie is that it does so with ease.:::1:::4/4
Emotional without being cloying, honest and funny and low key.:::1:::None
Scene by scene, 50/50 can be both amusing and moving, with the tightly wound Gordon-Levitt and the boundaryless Rogen forming an oddly complementary pair. But as a whole the movie never quite coheres.:::0:::None
The emotional payday the Jonathan Levine-directed 50/50 dowels out is hugely rewarding.:::1:::4/5
Has humorous moments and heavy ones, and neither half feels forced.:::1:::None
Cancer is not funny! And yet, in the hands of Seth Rogen and his posse the real story of one of his friends, Will Reiser, who battled and survived cancer, is a tour-de-force tale of love, friendship and triumph!:::1:::None
Without knowing the background of the real story, as will likely be true for most moviegoers, there is real suspense as to the outcome.:::1:::None
In other hands, Adam might well be hard to take. But as the comedy in 50/50 turns darker, Gordon-Levitt, who's maybe the most natural, least affected actor of his generation, makes prickly plenty engaging.:::1:::8/10
Splitting the difference, 50/50 gets a comparable assessment: Not half-bad, but not 100% either. Given the topic of fending off death, it's surprising that the story never quite sparks to life.:::1:::6/10
There are some hearty, mordant laughs to be had in this uneven "cancer comedy," but the best reason to see it is the admirably self-effacing and deeply affecting performance of Joseph Gordon-Levitt.:::1:::None
...it's a pretty neat trick to blend comedy with a story that's moving and relevant; it helps to have a smart screenplay, a strong cast, and an overall good vibe. Those qualities make 50/50 one of the bright spots on the fall movie map...:::1:::None
An everyman tale with plenty of heart and honesty, the serious subject matter is regularly enlivened with jolts of genuine hilarity, some of it in delightfully questionable taste.:::1:::3.5/4
What ensues is "Beaches" meets "Pineapple Express." Which, I've got to tell you, is pretty much what living with cancer is like.:::1:::None
The tightrope act of a script by Will Reiser is elevated in remarkable ways by one of the best ensembles of the year, led ably by the great Joseph Gordon-Levitt, doing career-best, Oscar nomination-worthy work.:::1:::4.0/5.0
Somehow remains prickly and funny through every moment of its running time.:::1:::3/4
Fact-inspired yet unpersuasive, transforming neurofibrosarcoma into a lucky break -- a short cut to a more purposeful life, complete with an attractive age-appropriate cancer therapist to replace the unfaithful girlfriend.:::0:::2/4
"50/50" is an unusual comedy that should be taken seriously.:::1:::3/4
It wrings comedy from cancer and surrounds its saintly protagonist with sickly stereotypes. But the closer it gets to the mortal abyss, the more it feels real and revealing.:::1:::3/4
Director Jonathan Levine has the ideal approach to the material, which is to stand aside, frame each scene honestly and let the actors drive the story.:::1:::3.5/4
The truly outrageous idea, that you can use being gravely ill to get sympathy hookups for yourself and your friends - as underlined in the movie's original, better title, "I'm With Cancer" - is given short shrift.:::0:::2.5/4
It succeeds mostly thanks to stellar work by the wonderful Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who capably handles the dramatic heavy lifting, and Seth Rogen, who delivers big laughs as his raunchy bud.:::1:::3/4
"50/50" takes the hackneyed convention of illness-driven melodrama and reinvigorates it with honesty, clear-eyed compassion and unsentimental wit.:::1:::3.5/4
Whatever laughs and tears the film wrings out of you do ultimately feel earned.:::1:::None
"50/50" is a low-key, authentic, warm-hearted film; the cast is one of the best of the year.:::1:::4.5/5
...a remarkable film. Not one single moment rings untrue.:::1:::9/10
One of the best movies I have seen this year.:::1:::4/4
A wonderful, cathartic pleasure.:::1:::A-
Some people might take offense at the movie's tone. But it is that very attitude that sets "50/50" apart from your typical movie-of-the-week feature. It actually strengthens its appeal.:::1:::3/4
A remarkably tough-minded meditation on mortality, willing to confront the audience with harsh realities and to grapple with difficult, scary questions.:::1:::B
There's a simple elegance to way [screenwriter Will] Reiser and director Jonathan Levine tie these bonds.:::1:::3/4
No one is transformed into saintliness or transcendence but there are lessons learned, losses borne, and hurdles overcome.:::1:::B+
An uncompromising gem, the kind of film that hits all the right notes as it navigates from gentle, unforced humor to knowing pathos.:::1:::3.5/4
For every caustic one-liner and hip indie-rock song in 50/50,there are just as many hanky-requiring sentiments and just as many moments of stomach-churning disquiet.:::1:::4/5
50/50 nimbly draws humor out of a young man's illness, walks a tightrope of tragicomedy and touches on all the right points.:::1:::4/4
50/50 is very entertaining and touching, but rhythm eludes the movie from the very beginning.:::1:::3.5/5
"50/50" will be liked and appreciated even by people who can't imagine wanting to see it.:::1:::3/4
It's an impressive balance between humor and heart.:::1:::3.5/4
I admire the audacity of the script, which was written by Will Reiser from personal experience, and I laughed in most of the right places, as people in Adam's life struggle, often absurdly, to say or do the right thing.:::1:::None
The movie deepens in the second half. Eisner based Adam on someone he knew extremely well, so the unsentimental dialogue rings true.:::1:::3/4
Mostly it's just terribly funny and sad and beautifully acted and terrifically feel-good for being, you know, a cancer comedy.:::1:::4/5
Gordon-Levitt capitalizes on the best role of his career, one that justifies a potential Oscar nomination.:::1:::3.5/4
Emotionally honest even when it's going for big laughs and filled with lived-in visual detail, it's raunchy and touching without ever being crude or mawkish, a small, sharp comic jewel with a big heart.:::1:::A-
The movie has an inescapably autumnal quality, but it's funny throughout...:::1:::None
...easily the year's best comedy.:::1:::A-
It almost seems as if "50/50" is leaning too hard on the lighthearted shtick, until the final act, when everything comes together with genuine emotional heft.:::1:::B+
Neither the actor nor the filmmakers can get under Adam's skin, despite all the close-ups and the moodily shot scenes filled with the kind of movie silence that feels more like the groping of an uncertain screenwriter than of a man facing his mortality.:::0:::2/5
"50/50" deftly blends tragedy with comedy - in a way that feels, often effortlessly, like real life.:::1:::3.5/4
I don't think there has been a movie so far with this many good things going on.:::1:::3.5/4
Too pat and contrived to be the Oscar bell-ringer early reports have claimed, "50/50'' is most affecting when it shows callow young dudes struggling to come to terms with the ultimate party crasher.:::1:::2.5/4
sweet but sometimes a little too aggressively normal.:::1:::3.5/5
As a comedy about a young man with cancer, it needs to be serious enough to be real as well as light enough to be funny. Though it falls off the wagon at times, it maintains its balance remarkably well.:::1:::3.5/5
Levitt, the definition of nuance, is touching, funny, and fierce - an unusual combination of moods, but deeply affecting.:::1:::3/4
An amusing, heartfelt, but unexceptional portrait of friendship and survival, 50/50 gets a mostly favorable diagnosis.:::1:::B
A touching portrait of a courageous young man's journey with cancer and the varied responses of the people around him.:::1:::5/5
To the extent that 50/50 works, it because of Gordon-Levitt, one of my favorite actors.:::0:::None
The movie is more subtle than the trailers indicate.:::1:::B
This nervy film avoids being blatantly "life-affirming" or "feel-good," helping it earn its tears and laughs. The premise covers the first of those. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen merge it with the second.:::1:::4/5
Refusing to hide from pain or bow to it, 50/50 makes its own rules. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen are a dream team.:::1:::3.5/4
The result is a story that feels genuinely balanced, that provokes laughter or tears only when they're earned.:::1:::3.5/5
Just like the many bits of advice that are so convincingly strewn throughout 50/50, it emphatically validates one of the most enduring ones: Laughter is indeed the best medicine, especially when the stakes are so high.:::1:::3.5/4
The fear, anger, and despair of terminal illness barely pierce the movie's easygoing vibe, which becomes something of a problem in the second half, but for the most part this is fresh, sincere, and inquisitive.:::1:::None
50/50 is sentimental but never too much. Not with this cast. It's irreverent about cancer and that could be inspirational. And it's surely one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen all year.:::1:::A
The picture could be so much better than it is, and yet it's also the kind of movie that makes you want to grade on the curve, adding extra points for good intentions.:::1:::7.5/10
There's a better than even chance that you'll find it both funny and touching.:::1:::B
This ambitious comedy may appear benign on the surface but it's likely to stay with you and develop into something more than you might have thought. And in this case that's a good thing.:::1:::3/4
...what makes this "chuckles n' chemo" film so watchable is that it is, at its core, a fish out of water tale.:::1:::A-
50/50 is crude and funny, and it demands that you laugh. And you will.:::1:::3.5/4
A funny, thoughtful film, less about surviving cancer than about the agonizing process of growing up.:::1:::B
A picture with a commercial sensibility and a quippy streak, yet one honest enough to transcend the usual.:::1:::3/4
Although "50/50" is structured with the efficiency of a sitcom, there's an undercurrent of truth and real feeling.:::1:::3.5/4
More interested in healing through laughter than confronting the tough stuff. That's why the treatment goes down so easy.:::1:::3/4
By the end, it does manage to grab hold of your emotions, but it's a long way to get there and not really worth it in the long run as there have been other films that have dealt with this subject matter in better fashion.:::1:::None
The ever-nimble Gordon-Levitt sells both sides of the transformation with ease, he's an ideal leading man for smart, sensitive dramedy.:::1:::3.5/5
It's the Rogen-Goldberg touch, with the duo's characteristic Superbad mash of the sweet and the bracingly coarse, that sells this unusual downer/upper of a life-and-death comedy.:::1:::B+
"50/50" is a tremendous movie. It's also a really funny one, which doesn't mean it won't make you cry.:::1:::5/5
An edgy concept, promising director, and a fine cast done in by bromides.:::0:::2/4
My reaction to everything that happens in 50/50 was "Why don't they just walk out?" But nobody did, so I did it for them.:::0:::1/4
Too much humor and we lose the characters. Too little humor and it becomes a Lifetime Movie. Balance is the key and, for the most part, Levine finds it.:::1:::3/4
A tremendously endearing, emotionally complex motion picture that gracefully inspects the stages of grief, worry, and, of course, catharsis, approaching a delicate subject matter with a disarming confidence.:::1:::A-
Odds are you'll find something of substance, a few life lessons in between the laughs in "50/50.":::1:::3/4
The characters and dialogue are so cool and hip and accessible, the movie almost succeeds in making us forget this is Terms of Endearment with a heavy ladle of testosterone and a smirk.:::1:::4/5
Unsentimental, smart and funny, this dramatic comedy is the best film about illness I've ever seen.:::1:::None
50/50 mostly succeeds as a movie about a young man fighting cancer that doesn't give in to sap or sentiment.:::1:::None
Builds to the confidently sincere movie you hoped it would be, after dithering around in tired cutesiness.:::1:::3/5
...delivers some hard-core truths as well as therapeutic humor while treating more than one kind of death.:::1:::3.5/5
Levine has accomplished a tricky bit of juggling here: He's made a film about cancer that's effortlessly affecting.:::1:::4/4
This film could use a lot more affliction and a lot less cure.:::0:::2.5/4
A small winner; the director, Jonathan Levine ("The Wackness"), has a great touch, mordant but light-handed.:::1:::None
It proves that it's possible to be emotional and thoughtful - and funny - at the same time.:::1:::None
What a tightrope this movie is.:::1:::None
"50/50" is a gem.:::1:::B+
More than a cut above disease dramas, 50/50 spins eccentric humor out of savage heartbreak. And targets both the sick and supportive with equal opportunity satirical relish, that taunts without trivializing the human condition as universal borrowed time:::1:::None
The most upbeat cancer comedy ever made, 50/50 is effective as brom, romcom, and more.:::1:::B+
There's a vital difference between, say, the trumped-up day-seizing of The Bucket List and this, a funny, moving, well-grounded take on a potentially traumatic experiend, or at least overlooked.:::0:::2/5
Where is Madea when you need her?:::0:::None
[It] plays like an empty but diverting beach read. Your brain recognizes that the dialogue, for example, doesn't come from any place that remotely resembles relationship reality.:::0:::2/4
Perry sticks with the pedestrian shots and a Lifetime network aesthetic. He doesn't even take advantage of the film's exotic Bahamian setting.:::0:::1.5/4
Terribly shot and crudely assembled.:::0:::D
Perry's films are shapeless, but they're crammed to bursting with melodramatic twists, the kind that make the audience gasp as they chuckle. The movie's like an old sofa, overstuffed and misshapen, but so familiar that it gives comfort all the same.:::0:::C-
It's nice to have things we can rely on in this unpredictable life, and among the most reliable of all are Tyler Perry movies.:::1:::2.5/5
Tyler Perry's winning formula again is on display in the sequel to his crowd-pleasing hit.:::1:::None
Married offers a positive, if melodramatically heightened, portrait of upper-middle-class African-American life, one broadly appealing enough to satisfy even the Nancy Meyers set, if only they'd give it a chance.:::1:::None
Tyler Perry grounds this sequel to Why Did I Get Married? in his trademark blend of comedy, soap opera, and down-home southern sentiment, though he lets up a little on the moral proselytizing, which aids the digestion considerably.:::0:::None
Parental Content Review:::1:::None
For the prolific Tyler Perry, Why Did I Get Married Too? is nothing if not more of the same.:::0:::2/4
'Married Too?' isn't the perfect film about the challenges of being married, but Perry brings enough issues to the table to enlighten and entertain the audience.:::0:::2.5/5
Perry's most obscenely obnoxious, morally bankrupt, and professionally ramshackle film to date. It's appalling in every way, showing a disregard for humankind in a manner that should keep Perry on a therapist's couch, not on a film set.:::0:::F
Since Married Too? is not Perry's first attempt at filmmaking, his reliance on formula becomes disconcerting. In fact, since the execrable Meet the Browns, Perry's conventions have been unacceptable.:::0:::None

Though it has fleeting funny moments, this Russell Brand vehicle is a sputtering Pinto that surprises more when it runs well than when it lurches to a stop.:::0:::D+
Lacking the charm and humor of the original, this unfunny remake is completely unnecessary.:::0:::1.5/5
This feels manufactured, demographically calculated whimsy.:::0:::C
If there's anything worse than a watered-down, big-screen sitcom, it's a watered-down, big-screen sitcom that gets all socially responsible on us at the end:::0:::None
The Arthur remake seems to follow the recipe as best it can, but will leave viewers wishing they had just eaten at home. It has enough one liners to keep the movie moving along, but it lacks the heart and depth that Moore's charm brought to the role:::0:::None
So Russell Brand wrecked his marriage to Katy Perry...over this?:::0:::1.5/4
Slapstick dramedy fans will likely get some laughs out of the Arthur remake but the film is stuck in the same naive adolescence as its titular character.:::0:::2/5
Gives Brand ample opportunity and excuse to trot out his wisecracking, chemically-addled man-child schtick in a sturdy and believable narrative context.:::1:::3/4
In this rehash of the 1981 smash - which featured fellow English comic Dudley Moore in the title role - Brand looks and sounds comparatively bland.:::0:::4/10
There is no real reason for this movie to exist, but with Brand's winning star turn, it's likable and its heart is in the right place.:::1:::B
Russell Brand's a funny guy. But he has real trouble when he tries to spread his dramatic wings into any moment that doesn't land on a punch line.:::0:::2/5
Mirren nearly saves the movie as much as Nolte's bizarre cameos nearly destroy it.:::0:::2/5
Maybe Russell Brand's lot in life is to play raging substance abusers who eventually are redeemed.:::1:::3/5
Whatever was inherently funny about the original film just doesn't work here.:::0:::2/4
One wonders why time and effort was put into this sorry wannabe, considering that maintaining the tone of the source material clearly wasn't of much interest to anyone.:::0:::1.5/4
The problem is that our soliloquising Cockney comic as the "world's only loveable billionaire" (as the poster has it) seems too much like a child stamping his feet, demanding that love.:::0:::2/5
If you're not wedded to Dud's trust fund drunk, there's no reason not to enjoy this sweet and affectionate retread.:::1:::3.5/5
Russell Brand steps into Dudley Moore's old shoes and finds an uncomfortable fit.:::0:::5/10
The movie is as hollow as his playboy lifestyle.:::0:::1.5/5
This rehash of the 1981 comedy seems particularly ill-timed, as it's no longer fun to laugh at irresponsible drunks, especially when they're billionaires:::0:::2.5/5
It's depressing to watch something that starts out with so much promise devolve into genre fodder.:::0:::2/5
Although it's about a quarter of an hour longer, Arthur is surprisingly faithful to the original and brings little of its own to the table.:::0:::2.5/5
This is far from a sophisticated movie but the simplicity of the story allows it to have a lot of fun playing with the outrageous characters and silly sight gags.:::1:::3.5/5
Go-nowhere remake is worse in every way:::0:::None
The screenplay would embarrass Mother Goose.:::0:::None
If you find the Brand brand toxic, you'll probably want to give his wasted wastrel a slap, but Brand's narcissistic self-absorption actually suits the character of Arthur very well.:::1:::None
It's stylishly shot, reasonably watchable, not particularly crude (see Your Highness instead if that's your wish) and doesn't star Jennifer Aniston in the kind of role with which she so often flatlines.:::0:::2/5
A refreshingly good-natured and gender-equal comedy.:::1:::None
In the current age of austerity, it's hard to think of a more unsympathetic starting point for a romantic hero than an infantilised billionaire boozehound who has never worked a day in his life.:::0:::1/5
A pitiable remake of the sloshed "classic" from 1981.:::0:::None
Arthur could have been a caring and heartfelt comedy, but the tone is mixed, and the narrative missteps on all the wrong notes.:::0:::1/5
The original Arthur was a pretty mirthless affair, but the crude remake starring Russell Brand is infinitely worse...:::0:::None
[P]ointless -- and frequently downright distasteful -- remake... Great Recession? What Great Recession?:::0:::None
The biggest sin is that Arthur, who was such a soulful, delightful, oddly life-affirming character when played by Dudley Moore, is here merely a boring drunk. Where's the fun in that?:::0:::2/5
Brand fan? You'll likely enjoy his antics. But Russellophobics would be better off seeking out the original.:::1:::3/5
Arthur was no great shakes first time around; this Brand-new version is a full-on stinker.:::0:::1/5
Everyone concerned must have realised that they were on the proverbial hiding to nothing.:::0:::None
On paper, the remake may have seemed like a good idea - not least given Brand's own womanising and substance abuse past - but the result is a charmless misfire that puts Brand's movie star ambitions into cold storage.:::0:::1/5
Arthur boasts some nice moments, most of them involving Mirren and Brand whose on screen rapport sustains interest through the 110 minute running time.:::1:::None
Arthur 2.0 may not be a great film - and Brand's shtick is admittedly starting to wear thin - but the film contains more laughs than most of the Hollywood product poured down our throats.:::1:::3/5
Far from irritate the hell out of you in this, surprisingly, Brand injects a new infectious fun feeling into Arthur.:::1:::3/5
Steve Gordon's 1981 screenplay won an Oscar nomination, but there's no danger of Peter Baynham's rewrite doing the same.:::0:::1/5
It's a cynical, profit-motivated exploitation of a warmly-regarded character; everything about the film - most ironically, Brand's thoroughly unlikable lead performance - feels calculated.:::0:::None
Russell Brand, the genuinely funny talent upon which this misbegotten remake is hung, brings his manic energy, but neither he nor Oscar-winner Helen Mirren can resurrect Arthur from a laugh-deficient fate.:::0:::2/4
All that's left for Brand fans is to put on the DVDs of his live shows to remember what a great comic he is.:::0:::1/5
Brand improvises his way out of duller spots, but while the man-child shtick is fine in small doses, stretched over a couple of hours, it gets rather trying.:::0:::2/5
Arthur is well-executed tomfoolery slapped on top of sentimental predictability.:::0:::2/5
Director Jason Winer maintains a sprightly comic pace, but the feeling persists that we've seen it all before - and with a great deal more charm.:::0:::2/5
Sometimes a remake is just an insult - to the original, to the audience.:::0:::1/5
Arthur is riddled with cliches, suffers from a trite - occasionally offensive - screenplay, and has flatter direction than any Russell Brand vehicle deserves. [But] I could watch [he] and ... Greta Gerwig flirt for hours on end.:::1:::3/5
A light-hearted but enjoyable remake thanks largely to Russell Brand's charismatic and larger-than-life onscreen persona.:::1:::None
I didn't find this film funny at all. Why does Russell Brand have to be Russell Brand in every film? Is he an actor or not?:::0:::1.5/5
It's hard to see how a remake of Arthur could possibly go wrong. Well, apart from the fact that Russell Brand isn't really likable and alcoholism isn't funny.:::0:::2/5
Brand may be an actor of limited talents, but he is funny and so is Arthur.:::1:::None
Much as I wanted to dislike this movie, I admit to laughing out loud a couple of times, chuckling at Mirren's dry delivery of some choice one-liners and being won over by Brand by the end.:::1:::3/5
Turns out to work surprisingly well, thanks to likeable comic performances and a script that's at least consistently amusing, if never laugh-out-loud funny.:::1:::3/5
The dire script is from Peter Baynham - of Alan Partridge, Brass Eye and Jam. I can't believe he wrote it. I mean I literally can't believe he wrote it - it has executive interventions written all over it.:::0:::1/5
Peter Baynham's script has some good throwaway lines, and Mirren's approximation of Gielgud is a nice touch...:::1:::3/5
A blander, more responsible 'Arthur' with far fewer laughs and, be warned, a painful update on the classic Burt Bacharach title tune over the end credits.:::0:::2/5
Back in 1981 Dudley Moore won an Oscar nod for Arthur. It's safe to say, Russell Brand will not.:::0:::2/4
Although meant as mere entertainment, Arthur has some points to make about the cleansing power of love and its opposite, the destructive power of its absence.:::1:::None
The humour doesn't always fire, but overall the film has its charms - and a sweet innocence. The fact that Russell Brand is irritating works in his favour:::1:::None
Enjoyably sweet, and the third act kicks you square in the emotion-goolies.:::1:::3/5
The laughs come from the ever-dependable Mirren who can do one-liners with the best of 'em (and anything else she cares to with aplomb to the max).:::0:::1/5
A thin, insipid and oddly flavourless brew. Drink it responsibly. Better yet, don't drink it at all.:::0:::2/5
Hollywood in 2011, completely unwilling to make films based on anyone but Christopher Nolan's fresh ideas, goes back to the bar and tries to make that lightning strike twice, 30 years after it luckily struck at all. Guess how it all turned out?:::0:::0.5/5
So much has changed in 30 years. The theme of 'Arthur,' which is a remake of the Dudley Moore vehicle in which he played a lovable drunk, is not that drunks are lovable. It's that drunks have a problem.:::0:::2.5/4
It's still the same old contrived Hollywood formula, and it's not a particularly good version of it, but Brand and Mirren have fun throughout.:::0:::None
Where to begin counting the misdemeanors of this miserable, soulless travesty?:::0:::1/5
If this version fails, it's at least partially because it's been sent on the cinematic equivalent of a suicide mission.:::0:::2/4
Fluffy though it might be, "Arthur" is a heartwarming comedy. That's certainly more than you can say for the typical Hollywood romcom.:::1:::B-
It feels clunky.:::0:::None
The best that can be said is that the results are pleasant -- no, not even that. They're not unpleasant, and that's not the same thing.:::0:::2.5/5
Brand makes Dudley Moore's performance look like pure genius - and it wasn't.:::0:::4/10
Ugh, Arthur is everything that's wrong with remakes wrapped up in a one hundred minute package.:::0:::3/10
It comes down to this: how much Russell Brand can you stomach?:::0:::2.5/5
...a perfectly respectable remake that is too often foiled by its reliance on hackneyed elements...:::1:::2.5/4
Russell Brand gives a career-killing performance.:::0:::None
I hate to say it, but Russell Brand enacted a similar bad-boy-reforms arc last year in Get Him to the Greek, and he was funnier there.:::0:::3/5
It's amazing how a lifeless, pointless remake can provoke pangs of nostalgia about a mediocre movie. Such is the case with Arthur.:::0:::2/4
Russell buys Abe Lincoln's stovepipe hat and wears it for the rest of this movie despite numerous autograph seekers requesting the guitar licks from Welcome to the Jungle.:::0:::D
Abysmal...a serious miscalculation.:::0:::D-
An ill-advised remake of the 1981 classic romantic comedy co-starring Dudley Moore and Liza Minelli:::0:::1/4
Floundering and unfunny, somewhere between the moon and New York City, it lost its charm.:::0:::4/10
...a major disappointment, there are more laughs in the two-minute trailer than there are in the 110 minute movie, and what's funny in the trailer isn't funny in the movie.:::0:::1/10
It's not that Russell Brand has been wholly miscast as the titular character in the remake of Arthur, rather it's that he's been given too much space in which to work:::1:::3/5
A minor guilty pleasure, a freewheeling comedy that offers a fair number of laughs for those who haven't yet grown tired of Russell Brand (a rapidly shrinking demographic, admittedly).:::1:::2.5/4
Not even the great Helen Mirren can calibrate with Brand's clowning. ...This is drab hackwork. And it's not just because Charlie Sheen dwarfs Arthur's childish antics:::0:::C-
A strained Russell Brand is not a funny Russell Brand.:::0:::C-
I enjoy a frivolous film every so often, especially with a talented nutcase like Brand and a terrific actress like Mirren.:::1:::None
A contrived, silly mess with an irritating performance by Russell Brand. Greta Gerwig and Helen Mirren shine, though.:::0:::5.95/10
If you're a Russell Brand fan, "Arthur" has enough going for it in the way of moderate amusement that it's worth seeing.:::0:::None
[An] innocuous, blandly therapeutic remake of a comedy that wasn't exactly edgy to begin with.:::0:::None
I don't buy the notion that this is all a lavish fantasy to cheer us in troubled times. It's too clueless and condescending for that.:::0:::C-
The new, not so improved Arthur drinks less but still brings the funny.:::1:::2.5/4
Arthur may not be much of a movie but Russell Brand is one heck of an Arthur.:::1:::B-
How you react to Arthur will largely depend on your expectations. If you've never seen, or heard of, the 1981 movie Arthur you might find the new movie of the same name fairly...:::0:::2.1/2
It's a sardonic screenplay filled with juvenile characters, and the whole thing doesn't mesh.:::0:::2/4
Apparently, somebody thought it was time for a remake. Clearly, somebody was dead wrong.:::0:::1.5/4
In light of the deplorable track record for Hollywood remakes, "Arthur" is actually a fairly serviceable return to the genially funny traits of the original and borrows some of its best moments.:::1:::None
It would be impossible to top the original "Arthur" but this modern version is a consistently funny and sweet if not overly inspired remake.:::1:::3/5
The problem with Arthur is far more about concept than execution.:::0:::1.5/4
A couple of friends who've recently seen the original Arthur say it doesn't hold up. In spite of great acting, the remake doesn't either.:::0:::3/5
Take off the beer goggles if you think Arthur was a classic. Put them back on if you plan on seeing the needless remake.:::0:::2.5/5
Gerwig doesn't single-handedly save the movie but she does seem to have a calming influence on those around her, bringing out the best particularly in Brand and Mirren.:::1:::3.5/5
Remake of classic romcom has little punch, lots of alcohol.:::0:::2/5
Absolutely awful for about the first 15 minutes; eventually, it rights itself and becomes quite fine; then it collapses during a protracted final act...:::0:::2.5/4
A listless and largely laugh-free endeavor that not only fails to hold a candle to the original but which goes down in history as one of the few comedies to pale in comparison to "Arthur 2.":::0:::1/5
Brand's version resembles a mashup of the Addams Family's Lurch and Beetlejuice's not-quite-dead English cousin.:::0:::D
Couldn't that billionaire Arthur afford to treat us to a better show?:::0:::4/10
There was no need to remake the original "Arthur," its arrival is ill-timed, Russell Brand should never have been cast, and it never should have gone into production with a script this bad.:::0:::1/5
An unappealing recycling of the 1981 romantic comedy.:::0:::1/5
It's difficult to believe in Arthur, to root for his well-being after enduring 100 minutes of tepidly scripted buffoonery and shrill improvisation. Arthur doesn't need love, he needs a ball gag.:::0:::D
What could have been will haunt Russell Brand as Arthur likely receives some of the worst reviews of any film released this year.:::0:::3
Did Arthur need to be remade? The short answer is no but Brand does bring an entertaining charisma to a rather dull and average script. Catch a matinee!:::1:::2.5/5
Brand has a playful charm that wins us over, while co-star Gerwig is the girl next door who never lived next door to you (no matter how much you wish she did).:::1:::3/4
If you get caught between the moon and New York City -- or even just between two movies at the multiplex -- the best that you can do is skip this one.:::0:::None
Funny, sweet and romantic, it works.:::1:::3/4
This "Arthur" is missing a soul.:::0:::1/5
Was the lovable lush ever funny? I mean, honestly?:::0:::1/4
Russell Brand takes on a thankless task and earns at least some thanks.:::1:::3/4
Attempting to fill Dudley Moore's top hat in "Arthur," Russell Brand rapidly descends the rungs of the comedy ladder from "unfunny" to "irritating" to "vulgar" to the bottom one - "Andy Dick.":::0:::1.5/4
With a handful of solid laughs and a modicum of snappy dialogue, it's liable to amuse, if not overwhelm, an audience seeking casual, forgettable entertainment.:::1:::B-
...an utterly disposable remake that will be cycled through its theatrical release, then DVD, then pay-per-view, then cable TV and then finally forgotten,:::0:::1.5/5
The film definitely fails to live up the original in many ways, but still contains enough surprises to pull itself out of the disaster it was headed toward.:::0:::2/5
The plot is entirely predictable even if you haven't seen the original movie, and Brand once again proves his complete lack of range.:::0:::2/5
Fans of the original can sneer all they want, but this is about as good as we could have hoped for.:::1:::3.5/5
I can honestly say that the loud whirring noise you're hearing may in fact be (original writer/director Steve) Gordon spinning in his grave.:::0:::1/5
It's possible that my lowered expectations for this remake played into the fact this Arthur actually worked for me.:::1:::B
Wretchedly unfunny stuff, and apologies should be issued post haste to any surviving member of the original's cast and crew and the families of those no longer with us.:::0:::0.5/4
"Arthur" might be the year's first summer movie, in the sense that if you're stuck in the house on a rainy day with a large group that extends from tweens to grandparents, you could definitely do worse.:::1:::None
The very idea of this movie suffers from a form of myopia that simply can't be overcome. And, of course, all would be forgiven, if only the thing were funny.:::0:::None
Paper and possibilities do not a movie make. I'm guessing even Christopher Cross is cross.:::0:::2/5
The problems of "Arthur" are mostly ones of scale. The set pieces are too big, and the movie becomes too labored.:::0:::2/4
A little Russell Brand goes a long way.:::0:::2/4
There are moments here that are genuinely funnier than the 1981 Dudley Moore original, but the movie as a whole is less cohesive and overly melodramatic.:::0:::C+
There are so many reasons to dislike Arthur that it's hard to pick just one.:::0:::D
A tired story full of pratfalls, barn-broad gags, cartoonish stuffed shirts, and the exact same story beats you've seen in a million rom-coms, right down to the wedding-aisle confrontation.:::0:::C
Of the myriad things the new remake of Arthur gets wrong, missing Arthur's sadness may be the most damaging.:::0:::None
A pale, uninspired, unnecessary redux. Greta Gerwig, bless her, floats effortlessly into the film to almost single-handedly save the day.:::0:::2/4
Does what most bad remakes seem to do, dropping what's essential about the original, keeping what isn't, and wrapping it all up in a glossy, generic, heavily-promoted package.:::0:::1.5/5
It's pretty faithful to the original, which is to say that there's not much there other than a wispy and frequently drunken fairy tale.:::0:::2/4
Never have I needed a drink so badly.:::0:::2/5
It becomes drearily obvious that this movie was the result of nothing more than a "let's find a vehicle for Russell" meeting.:::0:::C
A funny thing happened on the way to this DVD review...:::0:::C
The most hysterical thing about the new Arthur is the instant wave of hatred it has drawn from the nation's 10 million movie reviewers.:::1:::None
Russell Brand fails to capture the appeal of Dudley Moore's mischievous drunken billionaire in this unnecessary remake of the 1981 comedy classic.:::0:::None
The last part of Arthur slogs under an unfortunate burden of sentiment and sincerity.:::0:::None
Throughout, Brand's Arthur looks ready for photo shoots, with his clear complexion, tailored suits, and neatly tended tresses. Moore often looked like his face was going to slide off his head.:::0:::2/4
"Arthur" is paced too slowly for a comedy. It's too flat to serve as a romantic diversion. And it's too light on relevant lessons for a redemption fable.:::0:::1.5/4
A flat but innocuous redo of an aggressively heartwarming film that hasn't aged well since its 1981 release. If you're not expecting much, it's not too bad. And if that sounds like faint praise, well ...:::0:::2/4
Brand can be funny in supporting parts. But he doesn't yet know how to command a front-and-center role, and Arthur groans with the effort from its first moments...:::0:::C
Only Mirren really delivers. Her depiction of Hobson's love for/exasperation with the errant Arthur provides the only genuine moments in this misfire.:::0:::1.5/4
Blobby and a bit of a mess but offers a fair number of laughs...:::1:::2.5/4
[Brand's] snotty, improvised quips are good for a few laughs, though three decades of skyrocketing income inequality have soured the comedy of Arthur's astronomically expensive self-indulgences.:::0:::None
An entire generation has come of age since 1981 and I suspect that only those who haven't seen its predecessor will find any laughs in this rote remake.:::0:::1.5/5
When Arthur works, it can be very funny ... But there's something missing at the heart of this rather sloppily-assembled remake, a bit of Big Apple bite to complement the story's overall fairy tale nature.:::1:::2 1/2 stars
There are a few things wrong with this second go-round - not the least of which is that, in 2011, hopeless drunks are rarely seen as funny.:::0:::2/4
The limp-d--- remake of 1981's Arthur - starring Russell Brand in the happy-drunk role indelibly created by Dudley Moore - sounds promising, but it ends in disaster.:::0:::1/4
when you consider the uphill battle this movie faced, and the lingering legacy it had to overcome, this Arthur is a winner:::1:::3.5/5
The surest way to kill comedy is to protect your audience, in advance, from being offended by it. And that's among the least of the problems with this new Arthur.:::0:::4/10
A symbol of Hollywood at its most creatively bankrupt.:::0:::2/5
It seems like an odd choice for a remake 30 years down the line, as Moore's portrayal is one of his best, and best-known, roles. But if you must, Brand is the man for the job.:::1:::3/5
Why?:::0:::None
If you must see Arthur, choose a theater that serves alcohol. You'll need it.:::0:::1/4
The original "Arthur" was harmless. The new one is charmless.:::0:::2/4
This is Russell Brand light, and at least to me, fits the part.:::1:::3/5
Russell Brand creates a distinctive character based on his own persona, rather than trying to mimic Dudley Moore. He is by turns hilarious and touching, with an inner core of sweetness we haven't seen from him before.:::1:::4.5/5
Like its titular, well-intentioned hedonist scoundrel, Arthur is really quite delightful if given the chance. Romantic and playful.:::1:::3/4
Compared to the 1981 version, this substitutes coarseness for humor and vulgarity for wit.:::0:::D
The story, about a happy-go-lucky drunk who'll lose his fortune if he doesn't marry, hasn't changed, but somewhere along the way it has lost its reason for being.:::0:::2/5
Why resurrect a film that was quaint 30 years ago and can at best be tasteless today? In fact, tastelessness might have been the right way to go.:::0:::None
Despite Mirren's estimable presence, the new Arthur has little of its own to offer. It's the same story, told with much less heart.:::0:::None
I really started to wonder: Why are we sitting and watching this dithering, half-cocked egomaniac?:::0:::C+
So many things are slightly wrong with the remake of Arthur that little feels right, and Christopher Cross' original theme song inspires the key question for everyone involved: Is this really the best that you can do?:::0:::C
Brand definitely carries the first hour with his free-associative riffing and childlike energy...:::1:::2.5/5
This remake seems to exist only to zap the original of its minor pleasures.:::0:::None
Despite some amusing bits and a very capable and handsomely mounted production, the results never truly outgrow diversionary setpiece amusement, and coalce.:::1:::None
...brilliantly manages to blend big laughs with high drama.:::1:::3.5/4
A pitch-perfect blend of comedy and tragedy that will leave you with a lump in your throat, and a tear in your eye.:::1:::9/10
That leaves it to Gordon-Levitt to take on the emotional weight of the film. And while he's always convincing, the surrounding story elements make for a less than resonant experience.:::0:::None
I think it navigates some tricky tonal shifts in ways that are impressive and at times quite moving.:::1:::B+
Will Reiser's semiautobiographical script initially prescribes too artificial a story treatment for its characters but is rescued by a genial, low-key vibe that builds in sensitivity and emotion up through the final reels.:::1:::None
Rises above its difficult subject matter to create a movie that's warm and poignant but incredibly funny as well.:::1:::9/10
A soft and sweet cancer drama that hits with the force of an ill-timed hug, 50/50 is the winsomely told story of a young man blindsided by his own body and the ways in which his inherently lonely struggle upturns his life.:::1:::3/5
Reiser has written his characters with an indelible sweetness and vulnerability, which allows the cast to deliver performances with some depth.:::1:::None
Takes what I believe is one of the most realistic approaches to cancer and cancer treatment you'll see on screen, but remembers to treat its potentially delicate subject matter with a blunt sense of humor.:::1:::3/4
Even hardened cynics will embrace the cliche -- yep, you will laugh, you will cry.:::1:::3.5/4
So this isn't a great re-imagining of the classic fairy tale Beauty and the Beast, but Beastly does have mass tweener appeal.:::1:::6/10
Under-rated.:::1:::3/4
Daniel Barnz's movie certainly doesn't have any inner depth behind its slick surface, but Neil Patrick Harris's nifty wisecracks, Mary-Kate Olsen's spooky glares and the brisk pacing means that Beastly isn't quite as hideous as you might imagine:::1:::None
Hudgens is a likeable on-screen presence, Olsen a complete riot, and Pettyfer teases teeny bits of a performance as a genuinely unpleasant baddie that could be the making of him one day, should the right script come along.:::1:::3/5
Beauty and the blech.:::0:::1/5
... tone deaf (do students today really say "hurl chunks" and "Too cool for school"?), predictably plotted, filled with drippy love songs that would embarrass Bryan Ferry.:::0:::1/4
Some snappy pacing and hints of pain throbbing beneath the cool sarcasm of teens push much of Beastly past its skin-deep pandering to a teen demographic. Still, this 21st-century fairy tale doesn't wilt, but it's not quite refreshed, either.:::0:::None
It's basically programming a generation of young girls to yield to the will of a patriarchal society and grow up to become biddable Stepford Wives. This evil must be stopped.:::0:::1/5
Beauty And The Beast except with the lusty, gothic menace that makes that story interesting replaced by moany teenagers and crap acoustic guitar music. Or, in short, Dawson's Freak.:::0:::1/5
Undermines its central message about substance over style by sacrificing characterisation for glossy visuals.:::0:::None
Beastly doesn't quite cover it. Not even monstrous, gruesome or grotesque come close.:::0:::1/5
It's not nearly as bad as you've probably heard, thanks to a mercifully short running time and decent performances throughout, but a sloppy script denies Beastly the hormone-infused gravitas it desperately needs.:::0:::2/5
Beastly has some groan-inducing lines and acting to match.:::0:::2/5
Fails to convince on every level, thanks to an ironically charisma-free performance from Alex Pettyfer.:::0:::1/5
'Beastly' is a special brand of hogwash: a fairy tale that preaches inner beauty while refusing to obscure the looks of its doomed hero.:::0:::1/5
A tween-baiting update that sullies the elegant fairytale with privileged brats in penthouses. Beastly is a crass, spirit-sapping bore.:::0:::1/5
In every aspect, from story to tone to characterization to visual aesthetic, it's laughably perfunctory, as though everyone involved were too embarrassed to give it more than a half-ironic token effort.:::0:::D-
Maybe the next time they tell this story it'll star the cast of Jersey Shore and The Garbage Pail Kids. Why shouldn't it?:::0:::0.5/5
Somewhere inside 'Beastly' is a gorgeous, intelligent film, straining to get out of a ridiculous subplot and dopey set-up.:::0:::2/4
Beneath it all, however, is a movie with a good heart.:::1:::2.5/4
"Beastly" is a poor representation of its source material and creates a monster out of it its inherent themes.:::0:::D+
Undeveloped characters, undeveloped performances, undeveloped emotions and a mess of a script that could have benefited greatly from an extensive rewrite. Or at least some singing crockery.:::0:::1.5/4
A clueless, pointless inanity that's destined for the DVD discard bin, while Disney's 1991 'Beauty and the Beast' remains on the top shelf.:::0:::2/10
Another sad example of the Twilight effect.:::0:::None
... all strained wisecracks and moony teen angst ...:::0:::2/5
The one thing that I could call a high point is Neil Patrick Harris as Kyle's blind tutor.:::0:::None
Definitely appealing to teen girls, anyone else will only accompany them if they have true inner beauty.:::1:::2.5/5
Thoroughly solidifies the fact that CBS Films' head is firmly lodged up its cathode ray tube.:::0:::1/5
Worth getting excited for the fact that it rings in a brand new subgenre: the Post-Twilight Emo Fairy Tale. Excited? "Terrified", I meant to say.:::0:::3/10
This is Beauty and the Beast for the Twilight generation; they've paid for abs and sparkles, and they insist on getting their money's worth.:::0:::1/4
Disney did it better but this is an acceptable re-telling of the old Beauty and the Beast legend.:::1:::6/10
Beastly falls flat as a love story, and what we're left with are a few interesting ideas presented in the most patronizing way possible.:::0:::None
Beastly plays as an apologia for bad boys and the saintly girls who find them irresistible.:::0:::D
Stunningly bad.:::0:::D-
Beastly starts off promising, but it turns ugly fast.:::0:::2/5
Beastly is such an excruciating morality play that it feels more like a punishment to the audience than the characters.:::0:::None
Lackluster romance is heavy on lessons about superficiality.:::0:::2/5
Teens convinced that a pimple will kill their social life will find Beastly bracingly honest. It's the cynicism, not the phoned-in uplift, that works in this JV Grand Guignol.:::1:::C
For a fable about a magical curse, "Beastly" is strangely earthbound. And once it starts, it just seems to go on sappily ever after.:::0:::1.5/4
There are flashes of genuine wit and charm that, while they cannot support the rest, hint at what was intended and not realized.:::0:::None
At one point when Hudgens' character points out that she prefers substance over style, one can only wonder what she would have thought of BEASTLY.:::0:::5/10
Resistance to this sort of commingling of the classical tale with the high school milieu is, as ever, totally futile, and to its credit, Beastly doesn't try so hard to fit within the framework of the fairy tale that it bends itself all out of shape.:::1:::2.5/5
To redo The Beauty and the Beast and introduce a movie version of classic literature to a texting addicted, reading challenged generation, at least do it right.:::0:::1/5
Imagine Beauty and the Beast rewritten by a pack of teen girls high on Twilight and Gossip Girl, and you get an idea of what you're in for with Beastly.:::0:::1.5/4
An adequate updating of the "Beauty and the Beast" tale for a sliver of young film fans:::1:::None
No one erred by choosing to mothball Beastly for eight months. It was only in the mistaken decision to release it that the ugly came roaring out.:::0:::1.5/10
Beastly gets one timeless fact right: For hatchet faces, fatty cakes and Frankenskanks, high school can definitely feel like a curse.:::1:::2.5/4
Meant to cash in on the craze for fantasy films about hormonal teens started by a certain chick-lit vampire series, Beastly merely shows how Twilight got it right.:::0:::1/5
You have to admire the bravery of the filmmakers, who went ahead and made a movie despite not understanding the subject matter. It's also pretty impressive that anyone could miss the point of Beauty and the Beast.:::0:::D
...Beastly benefits substantially from an uplifting, thoroughly satisfying conclusion that's arrived at without the assistance of a fake break-up...:::1:::3.5/4
Watching Beastly isn't nearly as disturbing as reflecting upon Beastly. So, if there's an opportunity to immediately dive into a nap after a viewing, perhaps there's a good time to be had.:::0:::D
More than lives up to its name with ultra-campy performances, high-glucose direction (Daniel Barnz), laughable dialogue, cheesy effects and a back-lot simulation of a Manhattan street that wouldn't pass muster on an after-school special.:::0:::0.5/4
How ridiculous, corny, and obvious is all this?:::0:::C
I'm not a 13-year old girl, so I couldn't care less about Pettyfer's six-pack abs, so I was focused on what a horrible actor he is with some of the klunkiest, most ridiculous dialogue:::0:::1/4

I'm a half-century too old for such tween swill as that which is regurgitated in CBS Films' Beastly," another in the ever-expanding clones of Twilight wannabes...:::0:::1/5
It would be disturbing if it weren't so incompetently hilarious.:::0:::1/4
Oh, yes, the script is a little ham-fisted, plowing through exposition and establishing character with a steam shovel, but in a tale like this, sometimes being obvious and cutting to the chase can be a virtue.:::1:::3/4
[A] tin-eared, corny attempt at fairy-tale interpretation.:::0:::None
A slipshod teen sudser starring 20-year-olds playing 17-year-olds penned as 12-year-olds.:::0:::1.5/4
In an era of bullies and mean girls, "Gossip Girls" and "Pretty Little Liars," it's nice to have such a tenderhearted fairy tale.:::1:::B+
A pallid, formulaic teen romance that might have benefited from a little snark.:::0:::None
Beastly is just as superficial and obsessed with looks as the characters and the mindset it rails against, which would seem like a bitter, frustrating irony if it merited the emotional reaction to care that much.:::0:::None
Beastly manages to show you all the ways it might have worked by missing every available mark, sometimes by the gaping expanse between Alex Pettyfer's ears, sometimes only by the feline curl of Vanessa Hudgens' smile.:::0:::5.5/10
Like Pettyfer, Vanessa Hudgens is blessed with amazing looks to go along with her limited acting.:::0:::2/4
There's just not enough substance to make Beastly anything more than another cheesy teen romance movie.:::0:::2/5
Roses and love bloom, and you might giggle yourself sick, but this is the kind of cornball entertainment that rainy afternoons were made for. Throw in a cozy sofa too. Beastly will size down well on your television.:::1:::3/5
It takes guts to transform heartthrob Alex Pettyfer into a disfigured hero for the bulk of Beastly, a contemporary retelling of Beauty and the Beast. It takes even more guts to do it differently than the book's fans might expect.:::1:::B-
It's dogged by awkward dialogue, a ridiculous plot and lackluster performances, especially by the leads, Alex Pettyfer and Vanessa Hudgens.:::0:::None
"Beastly" is not the best or the worst teen movie I've ever seen, but given the talented cast (especially Harris), I would have loved to see them tackle a more realistic reboot.:::0:::2.5/4
A sly and pleasant-enough young-adult programmer that is more likeable than not.:::1:::3/5
An intolerably sappy "Beauty and the Beast" for the Clearasil set.:::0:::2/4
Beauty and the Beast Lite. Might appeal to 11-year-old girls.:::0:::2/5
Everything and everyone looks very pretty, with even Kyle's disfigurement looking like it would make a cool T-shirt logo; nothing, and nobody, makes any sense.:::0:::2/4
Sure, Beastly's underlying message is a worthy one, but by the time the film gets there the audience's ability to empathize will be sorely tested.:::0:::1.5/4
Beastly is tolerable enough for a March release. Yes, that is damning with faint praise.:::0:::2/4
From conception to execution, this is a misguided effort to update the classic fairytale for a younger generation; if you like the fable, please revisit the 1946 Jean Cocteau film or even the 1991 Disney animated musical.:::0:::C-

the filmic equivalent of the word, "duh.":::0:::1.5/5
Blandly literal and flabbily familiar, the great irony of Beastly is that this filmed version of the classic parable of how beauty is only skin-deep has so very little going on under the surface.:::0:::1/5
Poorly written, amateurishly acted and cheesily made,...this high school morality tale that recasts the old fairy tale for the 'Twilight' audience...resembles a chintzy Afterschool Special with supernatural overtones.:::0:::D
Trite and formulaic, Beastly is an inoffensive snooze.:::0:::None
A brain-dead update of the classic fairy tale whose feeble understanding of its own point runs only skin-deep.:::0:::None
The best thing about this movie -- starring Alex Pettyfer, Vanessa Hudgens and Mary-Kate Olsen -- is that it's only 86 minutes long.:::0:::None
Even Dudley Moore realized-all too late-that a second Arthur was a bad idea. So why have Christopher Cross's words not been heeded? (Once in your life you find her...):::0:::None
Worse than film school formula, Arthur's transparently the product of some powerful Hollywood agents responsible for foisting Brand on American culture.:::0:::None
Dudley Moore had a real moment with the original, and this is just a karaoke version. Brand and Gerwig deserve something better than this, something more uniquely suited to their undeniable appeal.:::0:::None
Eager to please, Russell Brand works hard in this uninspired remake, but he lacks the natural charm and effortless delivery that Dudley Moore had.:::0:::C-
I've got a 40 in my hand, and I'm pouring it out on the pavement in remembrance of the indie sensation that was Greta Gerwig.:::0:::2/4
The original Arthur was a mediocre film with a few laughs, not a classic. It looks like the model of wit compared to the remake that waddles into theaters this week.:::0:::None
The story hasn't changed much, nor have the characters. But the comedy is now crude instead of whimsical and its characters overblown caricatures instead of screwball personalities. A movie has been reduced to a sketch.:::0:::None

Mike Mills treats love and loss with a disarming tenderness and a refusal of sentimentality that make Beginners, his second feature, something of an anomaly among male identity flicks. What a finely wrought, wryly funny, transcendently sad movie this is.:::1:::None
It understands death better than it understands life; it understands memories more than it understands what to learn from them.:::1:::B
Beginners, beyond its pervasive atmosphere of melancholy and loss, suffers from a little self-indulgence. It's your typical indie drama.:::0:::6/10
Plummer, who won an Oscar for this, is that rare actor lucky enough to manage half a century of undiminished dash and elan on screen.:::1:::3/4
Life begins at death. A funny, engaging romantic dramedy about never being too late to find happiness.:::1:::3.5/4
Una historia profundamente humana en la que el director no teme escarbar en sus propios fantasmas. Christopher Plummer se aduena de su personaje de una manera tierna y conmovedora, que le valio el Oscar como mejor actor de reparto.:::1:::3/5
Good performances by McGregor, Plummer and Laurent. A lot of odd characters in this film. The idea of a cute little dog communicating with people by telepathy worked pretty well.:::1:::B
McGregor and Plummer put on a master's exhibition of timing, tone and tenacity.:::1:::4/5
In any other movie, the key character of Arthur, a soulful Jack Russell terrier, would draw all the attention away from the two-legged protagonists, but the performances by the three leads are so superb that everyone is able to share in the glory.:::1:::3.5/4
Like his irreverent film Thumbsucker, Mills tackles dark territory but never strays too far into melancholy.:::1:::4/5
Mills frames the tale with enough melancholy and self-reflection to give Beginners more than its fair share of observational truths.:::1:::3/4
[Director Mike] Mills... gives the film a celebratory passion in the quiet closeness of father and son and the playful first-person storytelling...:::1:::None
A quietly moving, delicately mounted romantic drama that touches the heart with resorting to melodrama or an over-reliance on conflict.:::1:::4/5

Beginners is perceptive, funny and moving.:::1:::4/5
Veers between being at times rather tedious and at others very moving.:::1:::3.5/5
A beautifully understated piece of filmmaking and a playfully inventive style of storytelling are combined to great effect in Beginners.:::1:::3.5/5
It does get a bit too cute stylistically, but the easy chemistry between the three leads ensures this adds up to a gentle and often touching charmer.:::1:::None
"A powerful homage not only to one's parents but to the power of community.":::1:::None
Mike Mills wants his own experience to be an example of a universal truth about all the things he went through when, like Hal (Christopher Plummer), his father, came out of the closet as gay, after a 45 year marriage and on the eve of terminal cancer:::1:::None
A story about the meaning of life, exploring what's real, what's important and most importantly what can be sustained:::1:::None
A deeply-felt call to boldness in all its forms, whether it's romantic, parental or septuagenarian love.:::1:::3.5/5
I saw Beginners after hearing from some people that it was too twee and from others that it was funny and moving. I kind of agree with both points of view.:::1:::3/5
There are some potentially 'quirky' situational landmines that the writer/director skirts around, but skirt he does, never letting the gimmickry of a scene get in the way of its emotional truth.:::1:::4.5/5
If this is style over substance filmmaking, then I don't think my tear ducts could handle substance over style.:::1:::None
One can only regret this writer-director's decision to cram so much material into the mix that some fine understated performances, and much of the film's emotional impact, are obscured along the way.:::0:::None
Beginners is immensely moving, funny and involving, the acting beyond reproach...:::1:::None
Mike Mills' new film has all the caricatures of an 'indie' production but the skilled filmmaker knows how to keep each just in check, and hold firm to a central narrative.:::1:::4/5
Affectionate personal pic.:::1:::B
Beginners is both touching and life affirming, qualities that many movies aim for but few truly achieve.:::1:::None
It's one of those movies I can't be sure you'll be tempted by, but I'm certain that if you are, you'll like it very much.:::1:::4/5
Funny, cute and humane, Beginners is a small gem of a film.:::1:::None
McGregor remains a likeable screen presence but, yet again, he seems to be in a never-ending search for a good script and a big hit.:::0:::2/5
McGregor, in one of his most assured performances, helps anchor a film that could have seemed very fey and far-fetched indeed. He underplays beautifully.:::1:::4/5
True romantics will fall under its spell.:::1:::None
Decently acted but so uneventful and underpowered that it will stretch the patience of mainstream audiences.:::0:::2/5
There is a sense of captivating innocence ... that gives Beginners a refreshing vitality and sense of hope amidst a challenging story of embracing change ... to find purpose.:::1:::4/5
An oddly charming concoction.:::1:::4/5
It is tonally elusive, cerebral and subdued, but this is a film with a healthy, if self-conscious IQ. It could be an excellent date movie.:::1:::3/5
Plummer gives a textured portrayal as Hal, but it's the character of Oliver, sensitively played by McGregor, that rings truest, even when he takes advice from a subtitled dog.:::1:::3/5
Beginners drones along in a state of melancholic navel-gazing.:::0:::2/5
One of those movies that I wanted to like more than I actually did. I did like it, but something about it just didn't ring the gong.:::1:::4/5
Beginners is a frustrating watch as it could have been so much better.:::1:::3/5
Writer/director Mike Mills, who based much of the film on his own experiences, is the real star here.:::1:::4/5
Beginners is well acted and has the occasional inspired moment, but its overly self-conscious quirkiness never quite gels with the emotional drama and the end result is disappointing.:::0:::2/5
It may seem a little too quirky at times, but the film does speak eloquently to a very human malaise.:::1:::3/5
With good performances and characters, Beginners is an enjoyable, amusing and occasionally poignant watch.:::1:::3/5
Mike Mills has taken a particularly confusing and painful part of his own life and turned it into a moving expression of acceptance, compromise, and the struggle to overcome obstacles.:::1:::4/5
If Beginners were a comic, it would devote way too many panels to McGregor and Laurent gazing wanly at each other.:::1:::7/10
Life-affirming, endlessly witty, and beautifully realized cinematically, the seamlessly flowing Beginners is nigh perfection.:::1:::None
Mills allows one half of his story to subtly shape the other in a way that makes for a more coherent and rewarding tale than its disparate elements suggest.:::1:::4/5
Oliver flits from depressed to charming and back again as the script requires, ultimately feeling less like a character than a grand contrivance.:::0:::46/100
In Beginners, the Jack Russell terrier named Arthur proves to be damned cute. Unfortunately, the movie around him is not cute, it's coy.:::0:::1.5/5
Inventive and enriching, affirming that a disarmingly personal, empathetic remembrance has universal appeal.:::1:::8/10
The film is not about a straight man's struggle to understand how his father is gay; it's about learning that happiness is always possible if you're brave enough to keep your heart open.:::1:::3.5/4
If few things are more tragic than lives wasted in regret and denial, then the converse is true: Little is more life-affirming than the discovery of dignity and meaning.:::1:::3/4
"Beginners" is warm and revealing and bittersweet, if a trifle all over the place stylistically and thematically.:::1:::3/4
This is a huge step up for director Mills.:::1:::8/10
Beginners pays tender tribute to that imprinting process, but also, quite dazzlingly, makes a person sincerely believe in the possibility of rebirth.:::1:::4/5
A strange and beautiful film.:::1:::4/4
It's really the acting here that distinguishes the picture, elevating the material and counteracting Mills' tendency to wallow. Plummer, McGregor, Laurent, and Keller are all excellent. (Full Content Parental Review Also Available):::1:::None
"Beginners" is a delightful film - gentle, playful, creative and ultimately happy - though it's a tricky journey.:::1:::4.5/5
This is obviously deeply personal material, which makes one wonder why [Mills] felt the need to cloud it with indie confetti.:::1:::3/5
Mills is making this one for himself, and anyone not in perfect alignment with the movie's glacial tempo of contemplation will likely become nauseous by the end of this lengthy, cutesy, empty march to the end of life.:::0:::D+
Excruciatingly faux-naive and sentimental...:::0:::None
Filled to the brim with C-level indie quirk that's too self-absorbed to even bother to be funny.:::0:::C-
The source of Oliver's sadness is so complex, it's never properly explained, but McGregor succeeds in convincing us it's real. And his scenes with Plummer are convincing and loving.:::1:::3/5
Wwhile there's plenty of melancholia, there is also sweet wonder and celebration in writer-director Mike Mills' semiautobiographical tale of a straight son coming to terms with his own love's possibilities after his father comes out of the closet.:::1:::3.5/4
In his follow-up to Thumbsucker, writer-director Mike Mills continues to evoke a state of perpetual adolescence: the only fears given real weight are of not being liked and of having to behave like a responsible adult.:::0:::None
Beginners finds life both ripe with possibility and ensnared in the past. But then every morning is a beginning, right? If only we could remember that.:::1:::B+
The soap-opera-style plot is draped in heavy folds of sadness, but the acting rescues it.:::1:::None
It's way less Lifetime movie than it sounds, promise.:::1:::4/5
It's an embarrassment of emotional riches -- some pure and crisp, others cloying. This is a film that delights one moment and, the next, gets bogged down in its morass of feelings.:::0:::2.5/4
An affecting film by Mike Mills that makes a virtue of its own awkwardness.:::1:::3/4
It's a quiet little gem.:::1:::3.5/4
Cuts the whimsy with melancholy...its case of the cutes isn't terminal.:::1:::3/4
I understand if you can't bear to see one more story of a moping single guy who can't commit, but consider making an exception for "Beginners.":::1:::B
It's a movie about untangling roots in order to grow.:::1:::3/4
Watching the film is like spending two hours consuming fat, sugary doughnuts of self-pity.:::0:::1.5/4
It's warm and perhaps a little too heartfelt, but it's grounded in the three central performances.:::1:::3.5/5
Plummer turns out to be nearly the only reason to see Beginners, which is on the whole an impossibly dreary film.:::0:::5/10
An effective portrait of a damaged individual uncertain about the meaning of love and commitment and the two key relationships in his life that teach him lessons about both.:::1:::3/4
Mills weaves emotional storylines together -- and anthropomorphizes a canine -- without stumbling into sentimentality. It feels true, lived-in, every single moment.:::1:::7.5/10
One of my favorite films in 2011.:::1:::9/10
A surprisingly accomplished mix of romance, comedy and drama.:::1:::B
You know you're in the hands of a superbly gifted filmmaker when he can pull off a talking dog.:::1:::4/4

Meaningful yet told with a light hand, touching yet a little undernourished.:::1:::2.5/4
Mike Mills' wistful, wonderful "Beginners" feels a lot like life - it'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry (well, me anyway) and, by its end, you'll feel as if you've learned something.:::1:::3.5/4
Beginners is the story of adults who are beginners at love but who are slowly, scene by scene, moving forward in their journey.:::1:::3/4
Mills has crafted a meditation on a huge chunk of life, and he and his cast have made a moving and lovely thing of it.:::1:::A-
Tenderly told and exquisitely performed, this is a gentle wonder, with characters we root for and emotions we believe in.:::1:::B+
"Write what you know," the standard advice goes, and filmmaker Mike Mills (Thumbsucker ) knew he had a compelling family story to tell.:::1:::A-
Many cherish this film. To me the cuteness feels pushy.:::0:::2.5/4
It's a hopeful fable with deep optimism and a cheerful style that kids itself.:::1:::3.5/4
This is a bright-looking movie with a long face that seems to have learned nothing about life from death but cliches.:::0:::2.5/4
At 81, Christopher Plummer gives an Oscar-caliber performance (and one of his very best) as a late gay bloomer in this touching romantic comedy.:::1:::B+
What a delicately and charmingly off-center movie.:::1:::3/4
As it turns out, nothing drastic happens nor are they drowned in darkness, but Mills does evoke a mood of melancholy and poignance, and suggests with rueful fatalism how the burden of memory jostles with the delight of falling in love.:::1:::3/4
Touching, and it has a tender side to it.:::1:::None
Charmingly quirky and cheekily audacious, the story of a young man and the changes caused by his elderly father's late-in-life revelations is crafted with sweetness and originality.:::1:::4/5
Beautifully cast and expressively told. It has the stamp of the exquisitely personal about it.:::1:::None
Engages the ambiguous and contradictory building blocks of human existence with wisdom, wit and thoughtful humility.:::1:::A-
Plummer's turn as Hal the movie just seems to radiate importance.:::1:::8/10
Beginners is all about human ambiguity, contradiction, shades of gray, and the inherent imbrication of the joy of having something and the terror of losing it.:::1:::4/4
Beginners isn't bad, exactly, but Mills focuses much less on the father-son stuff than on Oliver's off-and-on liaison with a pretty French actress.:::1:::B-
The sort of movie you never really stop wanting to love, even as it flits about and tests the boundaries of your attention. Warm, full of life and tidbits that illuminate life and love in elliptical fashion.:::1:::3/5
BEGINNERS somehow manages to be playfully quirky, with hilariously deadpan dialogue and many cute moments... and at the same time, it's absolutely heartfelt.:::1:::4/5
...the film belongs to the irrepressible Plummer who radiates an infectious joy of life and whose spirit watches over all.:::1:::A-
All the gimmicks in the storytelling ... can't camouflage the fact that the story itself was never quite worked out.:::0:::2/4
Sweet moments of subtle comedy and straightforward family drama mix perfectly with Mike Mills' trademark artfulness in Beginners.:::1:::5/5
Chock full of honest, believable, gripping emotion.:::1:::4.5/5

Laurent and McGregor are the year's most appealing screen couple, their scenes together so realistic they seem improvised.:::1:::4/4
A buoyant and disarming drama about sons and fathers, death and dying, living and loving and all the ways we find ourselves starting over, hoping to finally get it right.:::1:::4/5
Delicate business is being transacted in this touchingly personal and altogether extraordinary film from writer-director Mike Mills. Beginners is one from the bruised heart.:::1:::3/4
he performers are charming, particularly Ms. Laurent and Mr. Plummer, with his killer eyes (still seducing after all these years) and a voice that echoes in your ears.:::1:::3.5/5
Director Daniel Barnz casts his own spell of bad dialogue, soppy montages, and ringing cell phones as a plot device to ensure that the fairy tale retains no traces of the beautiful or bestial.:::0:::0.5/4

Here is Kristen Wiig's star turn. She co-writes, co-produces and headlines Bridesmaids, playing a woman who's, I dunno, roughly 26 percent comedically psychotic, but not so loony that she goes over the edge from sympathetic to repellent.:::1:::3.5/4
Bridesmaids produces frequent waves of hilarious vulgarity as it tells a sweet, endearing story about a woman suffering through a pre-mid-life crisis.:::1:::3/4
Bridesmaids is grossly funny.:::1:::None
The result is a very funny movie, part indie comedy and part frat-girl raunch (it was co-produced by Judd Apatow), that manages to get at some of the sly truths of female friendship.:::1:::4/5
At 125 minutes, Bridesmaids is unusually long for what is supposedly a raunchy comedy, and that's because the story steadfastly builds characters instead of knocking them down.:::1:::3.5/5
Bridesmaids won't be the defining moment of Wiig's career, but it serves to prove that the actress has the potential to carry a movie. She just needs a comedy worth carrying.:::0:::2.5/5
This is one smart script, brought to life by director Paul Feig and working on many levels. Where it sometimes works best is in the gutter.:::1:::None
Bridesmaids is being touted as a female version of The Hangover. That's an unfair bar to set, given how easily these ladies sail over it.:::1:::3.5/4
The star and co-writer of Bridesmaids, Kristen Wiig, puts herself and her female co-stars through the comedy wringer.:::1:::3/4
Kristen Wiig is brilliant.:::1:::8.3/10
Bridesmaids is likely to be a hit with both women and men, being half formula chick-flick, half raunchy comedy of humiliation. It's hilarious -- and too bifurcated to be satisfying.:::1:::None
Onetime Saturday Night Live castmates Wiig and Rudolph make Annie and Lillian's friendship believable. Which is why Annie's shenanigans are sad -- and hilarious.:::0:::None
Over the past couple of years, the R-rated comedy genre seemed to stale a bit, suffering a slight affliction of monotony. Seems all it needed was a woman's touch.:::1:::A-
A terrific comedy, zany, ribald and fearless in just about every way you'd want a comedy to be.:::1:::A-
Bridesmaids is a reminder that fresh content is still alive and well, especially when it's delivered by a group of talented actresses.:::1:::10/10
This is "Her Hangover," a smarter and sweeter stumble to the altar that never quite gets to Vegas, and doesn't seem to mind.:::1:::3/4
There's a full spectrum of emotions on show: how many comedies with a gag involving projectile vomit and diarrhoea can say that?:::1:::5/5
El humor de Damas en guerra se parece por momentos al de la comedia masculina mas guarra, escatologia incluida, aunque tambien hay lugar para los sentimientos y hasta el romanticismo.:::1:::3/5
It shows the dark side of people to a surprising extent for a comedy. It isn't exactly a black comedy or a dark comedy, but it does explore the way that friends can sometimes become jealous and sabotage each other.:::1:::B
Kristen Wiig, between her screenplay and fearlessly funny performance, gives nothing less than a tour de force.:::1:::3.5/4
Bridesmaids is a very funny movie, with interesting characters and great performances, but the film's pacing issues make it more of a chore to get through than expected.:::1:::7/10
I like that Bridesmaids aspires to be more than just a dumb comedy, but that doesn't mean it needs to belabor its point for what feels like eons.:::1:::57/100
Paul Feig's Bridesmaids ends up living in the memory like most weddings do; you went, you had a pleasant time, and unless somebody mentions the happy couple, you never think about the experience again.:::1:::3/4
I laughed almost without pause; at several points I made horselike snorting sounds that hurt the insides of my nose.:::1:::4/5
Whether it says something incisive about female friends and their inability to truly feel comfortable and rise above petty jealousies and competition, Bridesmaids never achieves the wolf pack camaraderie that The Hangover executes so naturally.:::1:::2.5/4
There are things to like here and the idea is a noble one. But in execution, "Bridesmaids" is a typical chick flick just with some extra rude words and vomit.:::0:::2/5
At 125 minutes, 'Bridesmaids' is long for a comedy, but it earns its running time by fully developing its characters and their relationships ...:::1:::B+
The movie won't change your life or grab a fistful of Oscar nominations come next winter. But it will make you laugh, hard and often, and it proves that sometimes girls just want to have fun.:::1:::None
... a girl-bonding romp filled equally with outlandish bridal showers and alcohol-fueled slapstick aggression, grand romantic gestures and furtive sex, high couture and low blows.:::1:::None
A bridal-shower blast of brassy hilarity and a cast of ferociously funny females.:::1:::4/5
The girls show the boys how it's done in Bridesmaids, an achingly funny mesh of gross out gags and heartfelt sentiment led by the new queen of comedy, Kristen Wiig.:::1:::4/5
Bridesmaids turns the gross-out comedy genre on its head and emerges bigger and better than its predecessors. It boasts unforgettable breakout performances and is the most important comedy of the year. And the best.:::1:::4.5/5
It's bawdy and a bit rowdy -- the comedy equivalent of a Lady Remington shaver in that it's just as good as the original Remington for men, only a bit smaller -- and pink.:::1:::3.5/4
Wiig's brand of comedy is loud, proud and just gosh darned funny.:::1:::5/5
Never does Bridesmaids ever aim for truly biting commentary, opting to settle instead for a series of poop jokes and scenes of social awkwardness.:::1:::50/100
Is it funny? Yes, at times, and its female-centric theme will appeal to many women. I just hope they have the patience to trudge through the slow spots and story detours. Bridesmaids, which might as easily bear the title Women Behaving Badly:::0:::None
It's one I intend to re-visit over and over if only to bask in Wiig's understated sexual appeal...:::1:::None
By filling the plot hole of Lillian's cluelessness with explosive diarrhea, the film undermines the whole "Apatowian Female Comedy" idea.:::0:::4/10
Bridesmaids achieves, through the laughs, a kind of poignancy and empathy.:::1:::None
At its best, Bridesmaids does that wonderful thing: tell the truth, indelicately.:::1:::4/5
Indeed pretty much a rom-com in the end - but hugely enjoyable, fresh and rude, both touching and funny, all the way.:::1:::4/5
The comedy to beat this year.:::1:::4/5
It's something old, something new, something borrowed and (cough) something very, very blue.:::1:::5/5
There is real depth to the characterizations and friendships. It is so funny because it is all so painfully real.:::1:::5/5
As it turns out, fart and poo gags ARE universal, as demonstrated by the mostly female audience completely losing it during some of the more off-colour scenes.:::1:::4/5
Sharply written and winningly performed, it delivers more laughs than any movie released this year, but also, the longer it goes on, develops into a surprisingly poignant evocation of self-scuppering loneliness.:::1:::5/5
The full horror of being a bridesmaid is shown, but Wiig persuades you there is something genuinely loving and sisterly to be found at the end of this incredible ordeal.:::1:::4/5
Bridesmaids strives a little too hard in places to show that women can do outrageous gross-out comedy too - but it remains the best chick flick in years.:::1:::None
By treating funny women as normal people, Wiig has crafted a game-changing comedy that's even better than The Hangover.:::1:::5/5
Really, bottom line: it's the best thing Apatow's put his name to in years.:::1:::3/5
Impressively directed and brilliantly written, this is a consistently hilarious and superbly acted comedy that finally gives Kristen Wiig the lead role she deserves.:::1:::5/5
Bridesmaids features some genuinely funny laugh out loud moments...:::1:::3/5
Move over Tina Fey, there's a new queen in town.:::1:::4/5
An effortless blend of bad taste and good humour with a wholly believable, often very touching emotional core, all centred around one of the finest star-making comic performances in recent memory.:::1:::4/5
A guaranteed good time, be you lady or gentleman.:::1:::4/5
It is artistically dishonest and embarrassingly naive to grant the status of "classic" to something only newly born. For a film to be called a classic, it must first stand...oh hell, who am I kidding? Bridesmaids is an instant classic.:::1:::8/10
A confident, self-assured comedy with nothing to prove. Fresh, occasionally foul-mouthed, and funny.:::1:::None
Wiig is pitch-perfect ... THE best unisex night out at the cinema you'll have in ages - this is the best proposal yet, and an invite you shouldn't decline:::1:::5/5
Finally, a female ensemble comedy that balances realistic characters with smart laughs and side-splitting farce.:::1:::4/5
One of the funnier comedies (of the) year (certainly better than The Hangover Part II), but the flat patches make the film... feel a tad long.:::1:::3/5
Completely and utterly honk-like-a-goose hilarious.:::1:::5/5
Bridesmaids is just fall-down funny.:::1:::4/5
I suspect that Wiig is funnier when she's not so frenetically intent on finding 101 ways to make a fool of herself.:::0:::1.5/5
The real problem is that Annie veers dangerously close to being unlikeable although Kristen Wiig's performance is so winning that she just about gets away with it.:::1:::3/5
It also made me laugh so much I had a coughing fit and saw stars -- and I can't remember the last time a film of any "gender" made me do that.:::1:::5/5
Despite its flaws there's no denying that it is actually very funny and that Wiig gives a powerhouse performance full of nuance and wit.:::1:::None
While packed with hilarity, the laughs are always grounded in Kristen Wiig's heartfelt and utterly relatable performance.:::1:::None
Stars Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph and Rose Byrne have long deserved vehicles to showcase their talents, and here they're finally afforded the opportunities their schlubby male contemporaries were offered a long time ago.:::1:::4/5
As the star and co-writer of Bridesmaids Kristen Wiig finally gets to display her full range and the results are brilliant.:::1:::3.5/5
Not the chick flick it sounds like, Bridesmaids is The Hangover with skirts... hilarious and a bit of a miracle at a time when a major studio tries to force-feed audiences such cookie-cutter dreck as a PG-13 remake of Arthur.:::1:::A-
With its often raw humour, rough language and soft heart, Bridesmaids is not a frilly girlie movie, more a busty, raunchy strut-it film:::1:::None
It's funny and it's charming, largely due to Kristen Wiig's great sense of timing and the smart comic script she has penned with Annie Mumolo:::1:::None
I'm sure many will see it for its gross-out moments but I was more impressed with how the film captures the fragility of its imperfect characters.:::1:::A-
The funniest movie of the year. Unlike 'Hangover,' the film doesn't rely on sexism, homophobia and racial epithets to hit a punch line.:::1:::A
The film veers a bit wildly between silly playfulness and extreme rudeness, but it keeps us hooked by maintaining believable characters.:::1:::4/5
Bridesmaids delivers sweetness and sass.:::1:::3.0/4.0
It's uneven, unwieldy and overlong, but if it's yucks you're after you'll find them in abundance in a side-splitting comedy that lifts the veil on every wedding's unsung heroines.:::1:::4/5
It's a pleasant, funny couple of hours at the movies with a few great moments.:::1:::None
While undoubtedly formulaic, it's head and shoulders above most of Hollywood's recent comedy output.:::1:::0.81/1
See? Women can be funny, too. And raunchy, brazen and, sometimes, profound.:::1:::3.5/4
Bridesmaids falters long before the alter.:::0:::2/5
The label is Apatow but the trademark raunch plays second, maybe third fiddle to a thoughtful examination of personality conflict.:::1:::B
Kristen Wiig deserves some kind of award for her dexterously funny and touching performance:::1:::3.5/4
The movie is uneven and lurching, but it provides many laughs.:::1:::None
...Bridesmaids would've been far, far better off had it been trimmed down to a more manageable running time.:::0:::2/4
Apatow continues his assault on gentility and good taste with this roll in the gutter that degrades women. The sad part is that there is a good, sweet movie lurking here behind all the vulgarity.:::0:::1/10
The film features at least four major comic set pieces that are quite funny, and Wiig is at the center of each of them (Parental Content Review also available):::1:::None
Kristen Wiig proves she can lead an ensemble comedy that's as raunchy as anything her male counterparts produced.:::1:::3/4
This movie is funny both as physical gag-based comedy and character-built, smart-person comedy in a nonstop, laughing-over-dialogue, smart-stupid, sweet-gross, heartfelt-raunchy way that's perfectly in keeping with the Judd Apatow brand.:::1:::4/5
Taffeta + Digestive Trouble + Feelings = Everyone wins!:::1:::4.5/5
... brings to mind Renee Zellweger films about ugly ducklings that long to be seen for their inner beauty. Big difference: In "Bridesmaids," the poufy swan poops in the street.:::1:::3.5/4
Bridesmaids is far from a seamless comedy masterpiece, but what does work eventually outweighs what doesn't quite fit together.:::1:::2.5/4
I liked Bridesmaids well enough -- with some reservations -- but I found it to be neither groundbreaking nor terribly funny.:::1:::3.5/5
Something even rarer than an American film with a woman as protagonist: an American film comedy that is absolutely and genuinely funny.:::1:::8/10
Kristen Wiig is funny, sweet and pathetic while her life falls apart, the ensemble works well, it's a comedy unafraid to get disgusting and then get dramatic, and just about every scene works.:::1:::B+
Despite all the hype about how gross and profane it was, this movie still entertained with a sweet story about friendship.:::1:::7/10
I can die happy, because I got to hear Don Draper say, "Cup my balls.":::1:::3.5/5
Cringe-inducing and often very, very funny.:::1:::None

...one of the most moronic, ineptly made and oft-times revolting movies to be released this year.:::0:::1/5
The great American mainstream comedy of the year.:::1:::5/5
Bridesmaids is not a movie for those looking for a pleasant, uneventful night out at the movies. Yes, it's touching. And yes, it resonates with a heart of gold. But it's also awkward, raunchy, and disgusting. Just like real life.:::1:::5/5
Bridesmaids moves with poise and confidence, making the hard business of earning honest laughs look easy.:::1:::3.5/4
The Apatow formula... now with women!:::1:::None
The best female-driven, R-rated comedy of all time. Yes, even better than 'The Sweetest Thing' and 'Outrageous Fortune.':::1:::8/10
Unfortunately, "Bridesmaids" bears the hallmark of Apatow's more recent, less successful efforts by being overlong (two hours and five minutes is way, way too long for a comedy like this) and having an uneven tone.:::0:::None
An estrogen-fueled adventure featuring madcap hilarity ranging from the scatological to the sublime!:::1:::4/4
I must take the time to single out Melissa McCarthy, who plays Lillian's future sister-in-law Megan. McCarthy, who stars in the current CBS television program "Mike and Molly," is a fireball and steals every scene she's in.:::1:::4.5/5
...in the first rank of Apatow movies; it may be the best so far. But more importantly, it's the first great Wiig movie. Let's hope there are lots more.:::1:::87/100
Too many of its strained comic bits were more of a miss than a hit.:::0:::C
Take that John Belushi!:::1:::3.5/4
Judd Apatow is one of its producers, but let's be quick to steer most of the credit away from him -- and even director Paul Feig -- and place it where it clearly belongs: at the feet of Kristen Wiig.:::1:::3/4
Kristen Wiig is a comic genius. Her performance as Annie, a thirtysomething woman whose life is in a tailspin, is ridiculously funny. We're talking virtuoso stuff here.:::1:::B+
"Bridesmaids" is a great first step for Apatow in finding his feminine voice, and an even better launching pad for the hilarious Kristin Wiig.:::1:::B
Bridesmaids busts through the party movie glass ceiling with a steel-toed stiletto and a tepid magnum of Yellow Tail.:::1:::3/4
Bridesmaids is about as far from a dopey Kate Hudson/Katherine Heigl rom-com as you can get. It is smart where those other pictures are dumb, perceptive where the others are cliched.:::1:::3.5/4
Bridesmaids is a stiletto-sharp, raunchy, no-holds-barred yuk-fest that stands as a worthy female counterpart to the likes of Wedding Crashers and The Hangover.:::1:::None
This crude and raunchy comedy co-written by and starring "SNL" regular Kristen Wiig takes an honest look at female relationships and modern romance. This will be the top destination choice for girls' night out gatherings as the..:::1:::2.5/4
Bridemaids may make Kristen Wiig the first female'SNL' alum to ascend to the A-list.:::1:::3/4
...strives to prove that gals can be as nasty as dudes, and when it comes to raunchy yuks, they are, until those darned realistic human emotions get in the way.:::1:::B
It's not mean-spirited and doesn't hate its characters. Also, it understands the key lesson of the Farrellys and "American Pie" and Apatow's previous work: this sort of comedy works when it has heart, and fails when it doesn't.:::1:::4.5/5
Bridesmaids takes chances, colors outside the box, and breaks the unwritten rules for what a female-driven comedy can and can't do.:::1:::B
it just felt like Bridesmaids had something to prove:::0:::2/5
Is this the female version of The Hangover? No - Bridesmaids is much funnier and way more heartfelt and human than that film.:::1:::None
Director Paul Feig has taken Wiig's and Mumolo's terrific script and given us the first, big comedy hit of the year. And that's not something to be taken lightly.:::1:::None
Features Kristen Wiig in a true tour de force that should elevate her to elite status among comediennes.:::1:::None
The film's central friendship gives Bridesmaids a heart as big as its laughs. It pays particular attention to the details and realities of maintaining long term friendships, with special attention to the specifics of friendships between women.:::1:::8.5/10
Wiig has terrific audience rapport, a prerequisite for comics, and a squiggly way of seeming totally reasonable and altogether daft at the same time.:::1:::B-
The only question is: Will Kristen Wiig ever be this good again? The answer is, let's hope so. Bridesmaids rocks. Hopefully, a movie star is born.:::1:::B+
Cringe-inducing, uneven, juvenile, overlong and painfully unfunny. It's a witless blend of crudeness, rudeness and lewdness which sets a new low for American comedy.:::0:::2.892521821/10
As much a coronation as a wedding, with Wiig emerging as a successor to Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett as the queen of knockabout comedy.:::1:::3/4
A film about women and marriage may be virgin territory for [producer Judd] Apatow but the results are the same. The film is flat-out funny and is worth saying "I do.":::1:::4/5
Wiig and company have impeccable comic timing and the humor almost always comes from pain. It's very funny, has a great cast, and will probably hold up to repeated viewings.:::1:::3/4
... hilariously funny, with an outlandish surprise around almost every corner.:::1:::4/5
Think of it as a cinematic bouquet -- catch it.:::1:::3.5/4
Crude but sincere comedy about friendship and confidence.:::1:::4/5
In the end, Bridesmaids is touching and funny and a tiny bit sickening. Just like a real wedding.:::1:::3/4
On its surface, the film marries gross-out comedy and romantic comedy and will make you laugh out loud. Right underneath that is a truly wonderful movie about female friendship that's quite unlike anything else out there.:::1:::4/5
Bridesmaids is an infectiously funny and bittersweet look at how life can change even the strongest of friendships.:::1:::4/5
The warring impulses within Wiig set a wonderfully skittish tone for the painfully hilarious new movie Bridesmaids, a screwy tale of female friendship and wedding planning from hell.:::1:::None
Prepare yourself to hear this comparison often: Bridesmaids is like a female version of The Hangover. But don't ever expect those words, or any variation of them, to roll off my tongue.:::1:::3/5
Star Kristen Wiig (and she really should be a Star with a capital S after this breakthrough performance) finds the humanity usually missing from not just the chick flick but the modern comedy in general.:::1:::3.5/5
[T]he kernels of a truly smart, truly honest, truly brilliant movie are here, and they get lost in what has become the standard Hollywood humiliation comedy...:::0:::None
An instant R-rated classic that could give the upcoming Hangover Part II a run for its money.:::1:::4/5
In general, the movie is so funny and bracingly honest that you can forgive the few moments where the momentum flags.:::1:::3.5/4
Whatever your opinion of the film is you'll definitely come out of it with a new respect for Wiig's comedy and acting skills.:::1:::7.1/10
Overall, the movie is a winner that should propel Wiig to a big-time movie career.:::1:::3/4
A bawdy, riotous godsend for folks who wanted to like The Hangover but just couldn't bring themselves to root for such an annoying box of a**holes.:::1:::8/10
Whether in a throwaway SNl skit or an overlong, uneven comedy such as this, Kristin Wiig has a knack for transforming something lackluster into something entertaining:::1:::2.5/4
Hands down, Bridesmaids is the most consistently funny comedy of the year.:::1:::4.5/5
It's not a movie for people looking for a decorous night at the movies. It is a film, though, for folks eager for some good dirty jokes, some refreshingly real female characters - and, just maybe, a new comic voice.:::1:::3.5/4
Not only is it funny, it has enough regard for its characters to acknowledge some real emotion without overdoing the pathos.:::1:::3/4
One of the great comedies of the 21st century.:::1:::4/4
Last week Something Borrowed showed just how bad a chick flick can be; this week Bridesmaids takes a similar setup and shows how good it can be.:::1:::3/4
Sweet, goofy and unapologetically crass, it's a broad farce built on a solid foundation of human psychology.:::1:::4/5
Director Paul Feig takes the film in a laid-back, absurd and often improvised direction. Such looseness suits it -- while the plot may meander, it provides plenty of room for Wiig and her talented co-stars to cut loose.:::1:::3.5/4
After one bad and surprisingly misogynistic comedy after another written by women, here is finally one that doesn't alienate either sex and should easily garner a standing as one of the funniest films of 2011.:::1:::3.5/4
I laughed harder than I have in quite some time.:::1:::3.5/4
If this is only a chick flick, then call me a chick.:::1:::None
It's the smaller, more observant moments in "Bridesmaids" that make it worth savoring.:::1:::3/4
Bridesmaids has so many funny moments that it can be forgiven for its excesses.:::1:::7/10
Kristin Wiig is sharp-yet-sweet in this shockingly scatological comedy, filled with bawdy, uninhibited babes.:::1:::7/10
Bridesmaids boasts the kind of wit that works on either sex. It's the more personal moments that truly linger.:::1:::4/5
By the time two hours had dragged by, I felt a lot like I had sat through a five-hour wedding.:::0:::1.5/4
Kristen Wiig is the best sketch comic alive, and "Bridesmaids" should finally make her a movie star.:::1:::3.5/4
Kristen Wiig has always been the bridesmaid, never the bride. Which is no longer a negative, as the emphatically unbridled Wiig takes the wedding cake to delicious new lows.:::1:::8/10
It's stunning that an R-rated female-driven comedy has been made at all, let alone that it's often uproariously funny and centers on believable characters.:::1:::B
It's [a] subtly pained undercurrent of Bridesmaids that keeps even the film's bawdiest material on the level.:::1:::3/4
It's nice to give the women a chance to play what is by and large a man's game; the problem is that the territory the movie covers, on both the bridal side and the gross-out side, is well worn.:::1:::3/5
A destined comedy classic that knows how to be crowd-pleasing without sacrificing itself to empty-headed callousness or shoehorned distastefulness. Let's not mince words, either: Kristen Wiig is brilliant.:::1:::3.5/4
Melissa McCarthy steals the film...She is fierce, she is fearless, she is wildly hilarious, and she raises the bar for the guys over at atelier Apatow.:::1:::B+
That rarest of treats: an R-rated romantic comedy from the Venus point of view.:::1:::None
It's Hangover raunchy, yet this ribald comedy is also surprisingly perceptive when it comes to confronting middle age, maintaining friendships and finding one's way in the world.:::1:::3/4
After shining on SNL, Kristen Wiig finally has a lead role worthy of her comic talents. And wedding prep gets the absurdly humorous treatment it deserves.:::1:::3/4
Surrounded by a hilarious cast, Wiig has definitely found her breakout role.:::1:::A-
Bridesmaids is just full of awkward goodness that had me laughing out loud throughout the movie.:::1:::4/5
In an age of doggedly unambitious comedy, one marvels at the finesse these first-time screenwriters and director Feig bring to marrying raunch, romantic comedy, and the tested but ever-true bond between women.:::1:::4/5
A film of great hilarity, humanity, idiosyncrasy and grade-A, eyebrow-singeing raunch.:::1:::3.5/4
Bridesmaids has a couple of X chromosomes up its sleeve, and you're wrong if you think that's merely a cosmetic difference.:::1:::B+
Kristen Wiig is an indisputable goddess of comedy. This rowdy fem-friendship movie she stars in and wrote with Annie Mumolo is infused with the Wiig brand of wicked mischief.:::1:::3/4
"Bridesmaids" is bust-a-gut funny, a high-adrenaline string of slapstick gags and verbal hysteria.:::1:::4/4
Resembles an "SNL" sketch: a good idea that starts out strong and goes on too long.:::0:::2.5/4
Cue a prolonged scene where we are treated to women vying for one toilet vomiting on each other while another evacuates from the other end in a sink. Laughing yet?:::0:::C
It definitively proves that women are the equal of men in vulgarity, sexual frankness, lust, vulnerability, overdrinking and insecurity.:::1:::3.5/4
Bridemaids sputters, coughs, and lurches, but it's a winning shambles, buoyed by a sharp, balanced comedic ensemble and some truthful observations about how close friends adapt when their lives fall out of step.:::1:::B
Hallelujah and praise the Lord for Paul Feig's Bridesmaids, a movie we've been awaiting for what feels like forever.:::1:::None
Bridesmaids is a chick flick in the way that a Rolls-Royce is a ride.:::1:::None
In an age of increasingly bland, formulaic rom-coms that seem to star the same three actresses, "Bridesmaids" is almost a revelation.:::1:::B
Think of it as The 40-Year-Old Nonvirgin in taffeta. Or the Kristen Wiig movie that her fans have been waiting for.:::1:::3/4
"Bridesmaids" is a classic Apatow factory product. There are about a thousand jokes - 70 percent of them are funny - and the movie is 10 minutes too long.:::1:::B
such an ebullient blast of fun that the resulting critique will sound like over-the-top gushing:::1:::4.5/5
Bridesmaids obviously strives to seem modern, but too often it mistakes crassness for freshness.:::0:::6.5/10
Bridesmaids is a groundbreaker. Usually it's dudes suffering from explosive bowel movements, getting drunk and disorderly, and spitting out the one word you'd better not call any woman. Not exactly a banner for feminism but equal time is overdue.:::1:::B
Funny, and subversive...:::1:::3/4
This might be a turning point in feminism and comedy, provided that both sexes can embrace it.:::1:::None
The movie is smart about a lot of things, including the vital importance of female friendships. And it's nice to see so many actresses taking up space while making fun of something besides other women.:::1:::3.5/5
[It's] a female-centered ensemble comedy that's ultimately about the importance and power of friendship. And, yes, it's funny as hell.:::1:::3/4
In every scene she's in, Wiig expresses on her face what no dialogue can. I want more of the fat chick.:::1:::None
All the flab dulls the sharpness of the best moments:::1:::3/5

Real life trumps 'reel life' in this fantastic, sweet, personal, human story about this true eccentric character.:::1:::4/5
There's a whole heap of Americana to wallow in here, but it's testimony to the director and subject that Buck still trots along at such a lick.:::1:::4/5
An unforgettable film about an extraordinary man.:::1:::3/5
A straightforward film but one in which Brannaman's gift and modesty shine through.:::1:::3/5
Singular in style and impressively reflective of its protagonist's nature. Universal in theme, but may struggle to find a wide audience.:::1:::3/5
Entertaining and emotionally engaging documentary with a powerful, important message delivered by an immensely likeable central character.:::1:::4/5
If you have even a passing interest in horses, you may find yourself smitten with this meditative doc.:::1:::3/5

Imagine the Dude from The Big Lebowski if he had been raised on a dude ranch.:::1:::5/5

I was entranced and intensely moved by this marvellous and unforgettable documentary:::1:::None
Meehl seems entirely smitten by her subject matter...and her blind adoration is a double-edged sword, imbuing her film with tremendous warmth but also nullifying any hint of objectivity.:::0:::None
As we see in Cindy Meehl's terrific documentary Buck, the rugged, plain-spoken Brannaman comes by his knowledge the hard way.:::1:::4/5
Cynics beware: Darned tootin', we're home on the range here, where seldom is heard a discouraging word and don't nobody be yappin' that Buck is too good to be true.:::1:::3/4
Interviews with horse people, Brannaman's very funny, elderly stepmother and director Robert Redford help round out the doc, but all we really need is time with Brannaman, and Meehl doesn't disappoint.:::1:::3.5/4
A bit stretched as far as its point is concerned.:::0:::2.5/5
The result is a portrait that expertly mirrors its subject: Buck is shaped with the same economy, restraint, and unfussiness as the man, to unexpectedly inspiring effect.:::1:::A-
Beautifully photographed..."Buck" shows life at its most simple level.:::1:::5/5
Following the exploits of real-life cowboy (and inspiration and advisor on The Horse Whisperer) Buck Brannaman, Buck is a warm and sweet-natured, uncomplicated doco tailor made for people who like a) horses and b) being made to smile.:::1:::3/5
The guy's a star: the magic charisma that works on horses, no matter how disturbed, shines out of him in person, too.:::1:::A
Buck Brannaman is so genuine that you'll want to go out and get a horse just to attend one of his clinics.:::1:::5/5

Stirring low-key and no-nonsense documentary on renown horse trainer Buck Brannaman.:::1:::B+

Idyllic, inspirational, uplifting film:::1:::8/10
It's a serene quality that has the same calming and inspiring effect on a movie audience: After spending 90 minutes with Buck, I'd probably walk into a horse trailer on his say-so, too.:::1:::3/4
Both Buck and 'Buck' endorse sensitive care for the voiceless, whether they be horses or cowed children.:::1:::3/4
It is perhaps a measure of the success of a documentary to be able to interest you in a subject that you'd not normally gravitate toward.:::1:::4.5/5
... makes you want to be a better person,closer in calmly authoritative spirit to Buck Brannaman. When he strides on screen, there's something mystical about this Wyoming cowboy, whose saddle posture could model for a Frederic Remington sculpture.:::1:::A

... by the time its 90 or so minutes have flown by, we feel like we've made a new friend.:::1:::4/5
In Buck, director Cidy Meehl captures a man who has dignity, a certain grace, and is self-effacing. Meehl makes a wise choice in keeping Buck from being contrived and just a feel-good experience. She keeps it authentic and human.:::1:::2.5/5
It's mesmerizing to watch him do his magic with problem horses, but the film becomes a bit of a one-trick pony after a while.:::0:::2.5/4
Brannaman's story is intriguing enough to survive the rather unimaginative construction of the movie that contains it.:::1:::3/4
Unfortunately, "Buck" follows too closely its hero's example: It is laconic to the point of sleepiness.:::0:::2/4
"Buck" is an extraordinary and fascinating story about an individual who believes you can accomplish more through simple kindness and understanding.:::1:::3.5/4
The movie never takes itself too seriously, maintaining a light tone with a few stabs at humor. The camera work is outstanding with great shots of a variety of horses in the great outdoors.:::1:::2.5
One of the most valuable things a film can do is to take you to a place or introduce you to a character you haven't encountered before.:::1:::3.5/4
It's a small story that trades in big emotions, and Meehl makes it worthy of the full-scale approach.:::1:::3/5
As a manual for handling animals - and people, for that matter - Brannaman's common-sense teachings broaden his story's appeal.:::1:::2.5/4
"Buck" is an absolute must-see for horse-lovers out there, but there also is plenty to enjoy for the non-equine-adorers as well.:::1:::None
On the surface seems to be about a fairly narrow subject, but proves to be about universal human truths.:::1:::B
Meet Buck Brannaman. You'll be glad you did.:::1:::None
Meehl's documentary features plenty of interviews with cowboys and ranch hands who've had their lives changed by Brannaman, but it lacks the literary or cinematic magic of either version of The Horse Whisperer.:::0:::2.5/5
It's well and good to hear Buck and others tell his story, but the film wouldn't come to much if you didn't feel the connection between his present and past in every frame.:::1:::None
You don't have to be a horse nut to fall for "Buck," one of those rare documentaries whose subject is so inherently fascinating that a fictional character could hardly compete.:::1:::3.5/4
Beautifully but simply wrought by director Cindy Meehl, this deft documentary is a poignant reappraisal of what it means to be human.:::1:::3.5/4
Documentaries have a wonderful way of making us care about people and things way outside our own experience, and "Buck" is a prime example.:::1:::3/4
Never has the special relationship between people and horses appeared more magnificent and even lyrical on film than in "Buck.":::1:::3/4
Brannaman has firsthand experience with the cycle of abuse and his backstory elevates "Buck" from simple profile to something deeper and more heartfelt.:::1:::B+
The character who emerges in the breezy, somewhat meandering "Buck" is plain-spoken, heartfelt, compassionate, witty, and wise.:::1:::B+
Brannaman is a fascinating character, but Buck is so tightly focused that only avid horse lovers will find it appealing.:::0:::None

Buck has the air of a beautiful little mystery; even knowing the uplifting outcome, you wonder at the strength that brought him to this place.:::1:::None

Buck Brannaman is pure soul, and so is this film. Whether you own a horse or not, ride or not, Buck has some mighty life lessons in store, and they are presented in a purely gentle and inspiring way.:::1:::4.5/5

It celebrates a communion between man and animal that runs deeper than any division.:::1:::A-
I don't know why, but I just can't get all worked up over Dan (Buck) Brannaman, subject of the documentary "Buck.":::0:::2/4
one of those rare films that not only satisfies but effects change in the viewer -- provoking a humble desire to live a more dignified life.:::1:::4.5/5
What a relief in times saturated with news of the worst of humanity to see something of the best.:::1:::4/5
It keeps you fascinated, even enthralled; elicits astonishment, even wonderment, and makes you grateful for the chance to meet someone remarkable.:::1:::None
Ultimately a plea for compassion and kindness for both horses and humans...:::1:::8/10
Holds your attention and heart for a tight 88 minutes.:::1:::3.5/5
All one needs to do is see the old footage Meehl's included of a wild horse being broken to realize how much more sense Brannaman's methods make.:::1:::B+
Perhaps Brannaman's art is too subtle and instinctive to be captured on camera, but it's a shame Meehl doesn't do a better job of capturing exactly what makes him, by all accounts, a miraculously successful trainer.:::1:::B
A warm and tender slice of Americana packed with genuinely earned tears and laughs, but never feels completely at home on the big screen.:::1:::3/5
A deeply humanistic film -- rendered with grace, compassion and an unfussy aptitude -- that makes a persuasive and heartrending case for the boundless capability of human healing.:::1:::5/5
Even if we can't live his cowboy life, Buck Brannaman's world is well worth visiting.:::1:::3/5
A fascinating look at one man's approach to life through horses, hard work, and compassion.:::1:::4/5
This film's effectively wrought communion between once-spooked man and animal is more than enough for any entertainment. It rides easily into your heart.:::1:::4/5
Despite these odds, Brannaman grew into a preternaturally gentle adult who channels hard-earned patience and compassion into his work.:::1:::None
This is going to sound corny, but here goes: "Buck" will make you want to be a better person.:::1:::None
An engaging and moving tale of a cowboy who has figured out how to keep life moving smoothly, simply by listening to what it's telling him.:::1:::None
An extraordinary documentary about a horse-whisperer whose spiritual messages and healing techniques are good medicine for all.:::1:::5/5
... a rare documentary as intellectually and philosophically rewarding as it is emotionally moving.:::1:::4.5/one
Doesn't entirely avoid affectation, but overall it's a touching story of two generations, father and son, each striking out on a new path.:::1:::B
The material with Plummer is so spectacular -- exuberant, poignant, vastly entertaining -- that it swaddles the rest of the film like a warm blanket.:::1:::B+
...a small wonder to behold. Mills fashions the set-up for an overwrought, thoroughly depressing character study into an oddly charming comedy.:::1:::None
While the picture sometimes groans under the 200-pound whimsy of Mills' filmmaking, it's also often touchingly direct.:::1:::8.5/10
For all the death and psychotherapeutic gamesmanship going on, this film is a comedy:::0:::3/5
On paper, it all could have been too cloying or self-conscious, but writer-director Mike Mills finds just the right tone every time. He also draws lovely, natural performances from Christopher Plummer and Ewan McGregor.:::1:::None
Beginners is not culturally astute.:::0:::None
Played with just enough whimsy to be funny and just enough reality to be bittersweet, Mike Mills' Beginners is a film with a light touch dealing with heavy matters.:::1:::None
This overloaded soap opera is so obsessed with sadness that it becomes a turnoff.:::0:::None
Mills delivers another film full of poise and poignancy that's emotionally-devastating, but also an enjoyable experience.:::1:::8/10
That deceptively delicate surface masks a movie with an unflinchingly tough heart.:::1:::4/5
Even the cliches in this warm mood piece seem unpredictable and without contrivance.:::1:::3/4
It's strongest as the story of an artist who, in his own way, has only begun to come out.:::1:::None
... the humans in Beginners never shape up into idiosyncratic, flesh-and-blood folks who get under our skin and engage our deepest emotions.:::0:::2.5/5
An unusually gratifying film about a playful 75-year-old man's zest for life and its effect on his serious and lonely 38-year-old son.:::1:::4/5
Arthur might have stolen this one were it not for a cast that inspires you to empty out your bag of superlatives.:::1:::None
Plummer ... creates an inspiring, fully rounded man in late bloom, and McGregor responds with a performance to match.:::1:::A-
(Review included within an interview with writer-director Mike Mills.) Christopher Plummer and Ewan McGregor...deliver excellent performances. A touching movie with truly universal appeal. One of the five best GLBT-themed narrative films of 2011.:::1:::B+
A too-quirky dramedy that warns: Life is not forever.:::1:::B
Virtually every moment of introspective tenderness mustered up by this trio ends up undermined by Mills' super-precious execution.:::0:::None
...the pervasively uneven atmosphere is essentially heightened by the ongoing emphasis on off-the-wall elements.:::1:::2.5/4
Deeply poignant and disarmingly personal.:::1:::None

Few recent movies have been this perceptive about such immediate human conflicts, much less this funny.:::1:::3.5/4
Running a mere 80 minutes, "Carnage" still feels longer than it should.:::0:::6/10
Statically filmed by Polanski the film version lacks punch and zest.:::0:::None
A veteran of stage-to-screen adaptations, the filmmaker in exile turns to Yasmina Reza's God of Carnage for his latest and shortest feature, but on this occasion, the translation harvests little from its perhaps meager source.:::0:::None
An intriguingly verbose film about adult arguments, which aren't that different from playground jousts.:::1:::4.0/5
This is an actors' movie, although it's not always pleasant. Waltz has the most fun, and is the most enjoyable to watch. He also exchanges dialogue with Winslet that best sums up the story's absurdist nature: "Why are we still in this house?":::1:::3/5
[Polanski] has crafted a bizarre little film that runs only about 75 minutes, uses one location, and only four characters who spend most of the film sitting/standing around talking or shouting at each other, yet the film is engaging and entertaining.:::1:::3/4
Carnage is ... very accessible, really enjoyable and, thanks mostly to a brilliant cast with an undeniable talent for comedy, really rather funny.:::1:::4/5
Given the powerhouse performers involved, this thing should have gone off like a powder keg, but [director Roman] Polanski apparently directed the film by text...A terrible film.:::0:::1/5
Carnage is neatly directly, sharply scripted and outstandingly performed drama. It's voyeuristic, it's relevant and it's hilarious.:::1:::4/5
A delightfully uncivilised car-crash of a meeting.:::1:::4/5
I thought the highlight of the film was after the guests eat Foster's homemade fruit cobbler, Winslet vomits over hubby and Foster's precious coffee table books.:::1:::B-
Carnage is ... more of a curiosity than a major experience - but it's fun and funny, and sometimes that's enough.:::1:::3/5
Parents and married couples, especially, will get a lot out of the biting commentary in Carnage. Not a cinematic triumph but a good way to flex the frontal lobe of your brain for a bit.:::1:::3.5/5
Each character seems to be rushing through their arguments and it's as if every single word has been over thought.:::0:::B-
The only thing worse than watching good actors turn in bad performances is witnessing a good director go with the motions, which is exactly what Polanski does here.:::0:::2/5
Although the play isn't quite as successful or penetrating on screen, it works as an entertainingly vicious doubles tennis match between two pairs of terrific actors.:::1:::3/4
Polanski hasn't had this much fun in years and neither, by the looks of things, has his cast. A wickedly dark delight.:::1:::9/10
The screenplay develops beautifully as layer after layer of civilised behaviour is pared back. The awkward interaction of parents about their boys switches gear to become a hostile interaction of couples about their inner demons and relationship struggles:::1:::None
It's fascinating, confronting and often extremely funny in the way only real life situations can be:::1:::None
Foster and Winslet have to endure total mental breakdowns and disintegrate their characters' closely guarded personas. Although it hardly needs to be said at this point in their decorated careers, they're fantastic.:::1:::3.5/5
full review at Movies for the Masses:::0:::1/5
The characters' all-round unpleasantness, and the film's merciless mirth-making with their failings, keeps things buoyantly, bleakly funny.:::1:::None
The work of a master, this wickedly funny film is beautifully orchestrated and controlled.:::1:::None
It's ghastly but utterly riveting. Reza is merciless in her dissection of social hypocrisy and she finds a ruthlessly efficient accomplice in Polanski.:::1:::None
A short and trifling thing.:::0:::2/5
The film is well able to make us think exactly how we might have behaved in similar circumstances.:::1:::4/5
It's an acting tour-de-force, the tension heightened by the claustrophobic setting...:::1:::None
Roman Polanski's sharp, short and stagily-shot adaptation of the Olivier Award-winning play God of Carnage by Yasmina Reza.:::1:::3/5
It's difficult not to feel that this would be more enjoyable watched in a theatre.:::1:::3/5
Short and bittersweet, it actually feels a little too brief at less than 80 minutes - and I doubt the characters would get drunk so quickly - but far better that than it dragging on.:::1:::4/5
Tensions mount, tempers fray and platitudes are thrown out of the window but Polanski's comedy of spite is hilarious, cathartic and perfectly-portioned.:::1:::4/5
A tightly wound, enjoyably cynical little chamber piece that features four indecently entertaining performances courtesy of Kate Winslet, Jodie Foster, Christoph Waltz and John C Reilly.:::1:::4/5
Polanski directs with an alertness and mordant wit we haven't seen from him for decades.:::1:::4/5
Some serious injury here, but not carnage.:::1:::3/5
One suspects that Alan is the closest thing to Polanski's spirit on-screen, and indeed it is Polanski himself who is the God of Carnage here, overseeing a deliciously brutal assassination of bourgeois dishonesty.:::1:::4/5
Polanski's theatrical film is a breath of comedic fresh air at the box office, and a highly entertaining must-see.:::1:::5/5
When it comes to being stuck in an apartment, Polanski still knows how to make an audience squirm.:::1:::3/5
Polanski's craftsmanship makes this chamber piece one of his more accomplished films.:::1:::None
Under Polanski's direction, the subtle switching of allegiances and steady erosion of airs and pretensions make their middle-class meltdown a joy to behold.:::1:::5/5
Brief, brutal and barmy.:::1:::4/5
Roman Polanski and Yasmina Reza have adapted Reza's award-winning play God Of Carnage into a short, sharp, spare flick.:::1:::3/5
A shot of pure, exhilarating cinematic malice.:::1:::4/5
Is it outrageous to expect a Roman Polanski movie titled 'Carnage' to have a little more bite?:::0:::2.5/5
An extremely black comedy of physical confinement and social breakdown from a man well acquainted -- in his life and his art -- with the shifting boundaries of accountability, culpability and freedom of expression and movement.:::1:::3.5/4
A four-way of furious awkwardness played with consummate skill.:::1:::3/5
The purging never ceases to illuminate the edges of jagged language and its impact on parents who thought they could avoid acting like kids.:::1:::3/4
The comedy is bitter and uncompromising.:::1:::5/5
A good chance to reflect on the considerable mechanical skill of the numerous people involved, which is a perfectly fine and not terrifically edifying way to spend 80 minutes.:::1:::6/10
...an overly neat, smug movie that, like the helicopter parents it pretends to satirize, is all about reassuring rather than instructing.:::0:::83/100
Polanski masterfully orchestrates all the mind-game mayhem, although he above all filmmakers constantly reminds us how important it is to separate the artist's personal life from his public offerings.:::1:::3/4
The scenery may be thin, but Waltz chews it with wolfish abandon.:::1:::3/5
The script is full of mean-spiritedness, insensitivity, hypocrisy and projectile vomiting, all of which was frightfully hysterical on stage. Though it should have been an easy transition to film, especially directed by Polanski, it fails miserably.:::0:::None
"Carnage", with a modest budget of $25 million, may well find its audience if for no other reason than the cast that Polanski has assembled.:::1:::None
Where previously we felt as trapped in Polanski's apartments as his characters, in Carnage we only ever peek in through the window.:::0:::4.9/10
Roman Polanski keeps things moving at a quick pace, so Carnage rises above its inherent cinematic limitations.:::1:::3/4
A pistol-shot paced comedy-drama featuring four outstanding performances. Loved it!:::1:::B+
Fortunately, Roman Polanski has a dream cast to lean on in his brainy but talky comedy of manners.:::1:::3/4
Carnage is confined chaos and unusually short at 87 minutes, ending with the abruptness of a curtain dropping. It's very possible to wonder what all this hostility means when it's over, and not have an answer.:::1:::B+
We could watch these people bicker for hours.:::1:::None
Given the Oscar pedigree of the people who made it, one can't be blamed for expecting a bit more from it, but there's definite value here, particularly in a pair of great performances.:::1:::3.5/5.0
As funny as 'Bridesmaids' and almost as gross...:::1:::A minus
The acting is sublime but you feel like you're eavesdropping on something that shouldn't really concern you and that you ought to tune out.:::1:::3.5/5
The actors seem to have fun, particularly Foster, working against type as the thoroughly unlikable Penelope. But "Carnage" isn't nearly as bloody as it thinks it is.:::0:::C+
A&nbsp;slow disintegration of the thin veneer of social niceties, revealing the human animalism underneath. Like Reza's equally popular Art, God of Carnage isn't as deep as it would have you believe, but both plays are catnip for actors.:::1:::3/4
[A] near-total waste of time and talent.:::0:::1/5
One of those movies that tears back the curtain of civility to reveal what people truly think and feel, which leads to plenty of hearty laughs and some shocks.:::1:::4/4
What are supposed to be transgressive observations about the holy state of parenthood and matrimony instead come across as self-satisfied and shallow as the pieties Reza intends to puncture.:::0:::1.5/4
If we grant that "Carnage" is a low-impact exercise in stripping away the social veneer, it's nonetheless brisk and enjoyable.:::1:::3/4
Intelligent and quite funny -- sometimes savagely so.:::1:::3/4
As you watch "Carnage" you begin to feel trapped. You want these diatribes to end, but your curiosity is so aroused that you can't wait to see the next escalation in these battles of words.:::1:::3/4
In real life, hyper-controlling metropolitan parents would not waste this much time on people they loathe.:::0:::2/4
The astonishing Waltz steals the picture, possibly because he's the one with a rational perspective (despite his telephonic obsessiveness): He sees the whole exercise as pointless. Ultimately, so do we.:::0:::2.5/4
Foster is particularly impressive in a stridently unattractive role, as the pinched, angry liberal who's orchestrated the meeting but doesn't get quite the apology she wants.:::1:::None
A sly and ultimately devastating story about the thin veneer of civilization and its uneasy co-existence with the savage spirit within us all.:::1:::B+
Skillfully acted by Jodie Foster, John C. Reilly, Christoph Waltz and Kate Winslet, [it's a] compact verbal slugfest.:::1:::B+
Taut as a snare drum, Roman Polanski's claustrophobic Carnage is a tightly wound piece of filmmaking that crackles with tension.:::1:::3.5/4
An odd little chamber piece, "Carnage" plays out like a very tense meeting from which you can't wait to depart.:::0:::2/4
You may recognize the arrogance and anxieties, the class resentments and domestic bile, from your PTA's most recent talent night. More likely, they're as close as the nearest mirror.:::1:::3.5/4
Drives home an oft-observed truth with wit and style. It's thin, but then so is a knife between your ribs.:::1:::A-
A brilliantly discomfiting comedy of frustration.:::1:::3.5/4
Think Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, but then think fun.:::1:::3.5/4
"Carnage" is subtly different from the play "God of Carnage," but the appeal remains the same: watching sharp actors yell at each other while civilization breaks down in a Brooklyn condo.:::1:::2.5/4
This has black comedy potential, but "Carnage" is less gruesome fun that it might have been, and for a surprising reason - the performances.:::0:::2/4
The entire point of  Carnage  is to poke fun at the fragile civility of the upper-middle class - they're all animals inside! - but how much more fun would this material have been if the story hadn't been about polite white people?:::0:::2.4
"Carnage" is an accident waiting to happen.:::1:::3/4
"Carnage" becomes a lesson in how to handle a willfully claustrophobic assignment with panache.:::1:::3/4
The point isn't the plot, it's the performances. Here four familiar actors seem ideally cast for their roles.:::1:::3/4
When cold apple-pear cobbler is enough to undo Jodie Foster's mother of the victim when everyone's still trying to be nice, there isn't anywhere else to go but down.:::0:::2/5
As befits someone with jail time hanging over his head, Roman Polanski does his best work in close quarters.:::1:::3/4
It doesn't have any real bite, nor does the verbal sparring between these four supercilious dopes amount to anything out of the ordinary.:::0:::C+
Great material, and it's got a really great sense of momentum.:::1:::None
Embattled filmmaker Roman Polanski has always been drawn to the dark sides of humanity, so it's no surprise he'd be drawn to the play "Carnage.":::1:::67/100
A film that makes its audience feel as trapped as its characters.:::1:::3/5
A deeply uncomfortable yet very funny film, featuring a quartet of standout performances.:::1:::3.5/5
A comedy? Lazy, tedious Polanski. It's all about putting on and taking off coats. Moviegoers will not rush out to the theater after seeing this.:::0:::None
The thin veneer of civilization cracks fast in Carnage, a darkly funny comedy of manners about how we live now.:::1:::4/5
...a criminally undercooked piece of work...:::0:::2/4
The stage play origins are obvious in the stodgy, one set shoot that makes the film feel claustrophobic. At least "Virginia Woolf" went outside for a while.:::0:::C
Despite the efforts of an impressive cast, the film starts out stale and then just gets tedious.:::0:::2/4
Carnage is a comedy of claustrophobia and revealed truths, and Polanski knows both all too well.:::1:::3/4
"This is getting to be, like, who cares?" says one character toward the end of "Carnage." They couldn't be more right.:::0:::2/4
Enjoyable enough on the surface, but it's essentially meretricious--so much, in fact, that you'll be a bit ashamed at having had a fairly good time watching it.:::1:::B-
...can be funny, but it's contrived and relentless.:::0:::C+
Carnage smacks us in the face with our own contradictions.:::1:::83/100
Seeing these four actors launching Reza's zingers at each other at high speed is pretty much worth the price of admission all by itself, and one thing you always know about Polanski is that he won't waste your time.:::1:::None
Thanks to a few nice comic turns and a crisp final 10 minutes, this comedy of bad manners just barely manages to rise above its own calculated chaos.:::1:::7/10
Amusing as some of this is, after a while I wanted out.:::1:::B-
Carnage seems to be a pretty good movie, but I have no way of evaluating it without comparing it to the play on which it's based, God of Carnage, which I saw on Broadway with a perfect cast...:::0:::2.1/2
Even as you admire the film's construction, it's hard to shake the thought that a lot of talent got thrown away on the wrong project.:::0:::None
The film version of Carnage hasn't just lost God from its title, it's lost the laughs from the play that brought it life.:::0:::2/4
For a great 4-character stage-to-screen adaptation see Jack Goes Boating. Or revisit Virginia Woolf. As for Carnage? Bloodless.:::0:::4/10
Eventually, the characters - and the film - find their belligerent groove.:::1:::None
Talky play-based film examines parental woes; some swearing.:::1:::3/5
Tedious and self-congratulatory. Wears out its welcome after about a half hour.:::0:::2.5/5
A great deal of Carnage's appeal lies in watching talented actors flip out on each other in close quarters.:::1:::None
Polanski is a master at shooting this sort of thing. Anyone who's seen his nimble adaptation of Death And The Maiden knows he can turn a static drama into a pulsing, unnerving endurance test.:::1:::4/5
A movie like this is an actor's dream, and all four players turn in excellent work.:::1:::3.5/4
If the original drama seemed designed to make patrons feel smarter than they were, its new director does the same favor for the playwright.:::1:::3/4
This awkward adaptation of the stage play comes off as an acting exercise but little else.:::0:::2/4
Polanski's tremendous skill with creating dramatic tension ensures that we're in for a gripping as well as a very funny ride.:::1:::3.5/5
While the talented quartet play these hypocritical sorts with finesse, the story grows tiresome, its cynical point made early and often.:::0:::2.5/4
This kind of material is never going to warm anyone's heart, but done as well as it is here, this pitiless verbal farce can provide bleak satisfactions of its own.:::1:::3.5/5
One of those instances where staying close to the enclosed action of the stage version is the perfect cinematic choice.:::1:::None
You're always aware that you're watching filmed theater.:::0:::None
For those who enjoy a tastefully decorated thunderdome of dehumanization, Carnage is captivating kick to the face.:::1:::B+
I was put off by the acting, or more properly by the spectacle of good actors dutifully following leaden direction, and equally by the writing, which is as thin as the veneer of civilization it purports to peel back.:::0:::None
an actor's playground, with Winslet and Foster practically leaping off the screen with the fearsome ridiculousness of their performances:::1:::4.5/5
The craftsmanship is obvious - there's no flashiness here, just lots of micro-control. But the picture is less artistic than it is artisinal.:::1:::7.5/10
Often very funny and bitingly incisive. Yet, like a visit to friends you don't really care for, you kind of can't wait to leave.:::1:::3/5
As a portrait of anxious, status-conscious Brooklyn parents living in a chiaroscuro of self-righteousness and guilt, "Carnage" misses its mark badly.:::0:::2/5
Overall, it's not really the actors or the director who are to blame. It's the lousy material. The saving grace is that it's only 80 minutes. But even that felt too long.:::0:::None
Roman Polanski's agreeably, then gratuitously, nasty adaptation of Yasmina Reza's play God Of Carnage.:::1:::B-
Polanski has earned the right to pursue his career-long demons of confinement and anarchy even in a minor film like this. But Carnage is not the word for what he's perpetrated here. Minor irritation is more like it.:::0:::None
No one makes sense in Reza's world of glittering mockery.:::0:::C+
Carnage is satisfied to be an absolutely virtuoso piece of cinema craft, and to give its excellent cast multiple opportunities to show off their comedic chops, which are considerable.:::1:::4/5
Scathing and funny and cynical about contemporary society and the hypocritical way we live now, Carnage may not be the dream movie I expected, but it has a dream cast of pure, unimpeachable ensemble perfection.:::1:::3/4
It is not simply about the breakdown of civilized behavior. It's about the very untwining of the ties that shelter civilization from the dominance of self-interest.:::1:::None
The whole enterprise feels slight, not exactly undercooked so much as lavished with unearned commitment.:::1:::3/5
Not even Polanski can find grit in its silly provocations.:::0:::None
Even as it successfully evokes the single location as a pressure cooker for heightened behavior, its take on the psychological and emotional side effects of such an airless situation never transcends the obvious.:::0:::None
A nasty spat between two couples over the course of an evening may not sound like a fun flick, but like any act of carnage, it's hard to turn away.:::1:::3.5/4
Carnage suffers from a common problem that afflicts many stage-to-screen adaptations: too much artifice and contrivance.:::0:::2.5/4
This acid-drenched four-hander never shakes off a mannered, hermetic feel that consistently betrays its theatrical origins.:::0:::None
Rarely have actors worked so hard to pull off such thin material, despite Roman Polanski expertly doing everything expected of him in the driver's seat.:::0:::None
The actors (all likely to be in awards contention) are clearly enjoying themselves.:::1:::4/5
Doc about the real-life Horse Whisperer holds fascination both inside and out of the corral.:::1:::None
Even when Meehl hits on first-rate footage of a fascinating practice, she insists on undermining its strength by reducing it to little more than a device for the delivery of a simplistic, shopworn message.:::0:::1.5/4
There's much to like in this character study documentary.:::1:::B+
Much of the movie - too much of it - is just Buck in the corral, riding, working with ropes and flags, conditioning a horse to behave.:::0:::2.5/4
Opens up a world to city slickers who may have never seen a horse whisperer in action.:::1:::B-
For those who dreamed of the west as a child, Buck is a lovely little slice of Americana: as filling and heartwarming as a slice of cheddar apple pie.:::1:::None
Its emphasis on spectacular landscapes populated by barns, corrals and rolling grass, and on values like family and community, holds a mirror up to lives rarely chronicled with such sympathy in American nonfiction film.:::1:::3.5/5
First feature for Cindy Meehl is confidently assembled, with attractive contributions from the two cinematographers and composer David Robbins.:::1:::None

You keep wanting "Colombiana" to go all the way in one direction, or all the way in the other. Instead, it just sits there, content to give Saldana a lollypop.:::0:::C-
Colombiana contains some thrilling scenes as well as an interesting sense of twisted humor, but there's not enough here to really keep us engaged.:::0:::6/10
Laugh out loud exploitation...See Zoe shoot. See Zoe kill. See Zoe strip (PG-13 style):::0:::1.5/4
Colombiana is caught somewhere in the middle of an engaging character drama and a brainless action extravaganza.:::0:::2/5
With a tighter story and structure, most of the film's problems could have been easily fixed, resulting in a film that doesn't feel like a build-up of superfluous events.:::0:::2.5/4
Ranks as one of the more eco- and econ-friendly projects of recent memory, what with producer/co-writer Luc Besson recycling many elements from his prior successes.:::0:::2.5/4
The action set pieces are elaborately staged and sometimes exciting, but the dull script, overcooked direction and wonky editing damage this otherwise enjoyable B-movie.:::0:::5/10
"Colombiana" never even considers that what Cataleya has devoted her life to doing might not be entirely justified and that what she does might make her just as evil as the people who wronged her.:::0:::D
A fast-paced tale of revenge, 'Colombiana' is a better-than-average actioner made all the more interesting by its female lead. Zoe Saldana ('Star Trek' and 'Avatar') follows the path of 'Hanna' and 'Salt' as a tough-as-nails assassin.:::0:::2.5/4
The latest disappointing actioner from producer Luc Besson...:::0:::1.5/4
click for full review at Movies for the Masses:::1:::3/5
Overall, the movie has enough clever chases, break-ins, and escapes -- not to mention a sweet, small tragic romance -- to make it worthwhile, but this isn't one of Besson's stronger efforts.:::1:::3/5
Colombiana has one true asset -- the seminude sight of its star, Zoe Saldana -- and milks it for everything it's worth.:::0:::1/5
A cynical mash-up of Besson's Leon and Nikita, though without their depth of character or emotional warmth.:::0:::2/5
It's as slick as an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, as fast-moving as hurricane Emily and as memorable as an episode of The A-Team.:::0:::None
Half the dialogue between these dirtbags is devoted to her near-invisibility, and all of it's awful: "She's like mist," apparently.:::0:::2/5
You'll find yourself laughing, then realise that it's not meant to be funny.:::0:::2/5
Even the talented Saldana can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear - much less a dog's dinner.:::0:::2/5
Colombiana is every bit as slick and silly as you'd expect, but Saldana pulls off her far-fetched assassin with panache, whether wriggling through a police station's air ducts in a latex cat suit or dispatching a crook with his own pet sharks.:::1:::None
Occasionally enjoyable in a silly way, but I have to say Besson's preoccupation with the little-girl-becomes-killer trope is looking a little unwholesome.:::0:::2/5
Saldana has star quality and action chops but the script is laughable and boring.:::0:::2/5
Colombiana wants to be Bourne with boobs, but its connect-the-dots narrative and silted script means it can't quite reach those bone-crunching heights.:::1:::3/5
In Colombiana, a basic formula is reduced to a few broad strokes: she's skinny, she's lethal, she's desperate.:::0:::None
Columbiana piles on so many ludicrous events, puzzling plot points and fake accents that it loses any chance to be a halfway decent pulp mix of beauty, bullets and bad guys.:::0:::2 out of 5
A far-fetched disappointment considering it was co-written by Luc Besson, the director of Leon.:::0:::2/5
It makes virtually no sense if you think about it, and the writing and direction are mostly incoherent. But it's also guilty good fun.:::0:::2.5/5
The movie delivers slam-bang action, so much so that we're reminded that movies have to MOVE to carry us along, and with 'Columbiana,' we're along for the ride, baby.:::0:::2/4
Tiresome and unconvincing.:::0:::2/5
With no sense of humour and long lulls between action, director Megaton appears primarily concerned with coming up with as many different ways as possible of getting Saldana down to her skimpies.:::0:::2/5
Poorly directed and badly written, this is a disappointing and increasingly bloated thriller that fails to sustain any actual thrills, despite a decent early set piece and a solid turn from Zoe Saldana.:::0:::2/5
Colombiana fofana, Zoe Saldana banana. C'mon, sing it with me! C'mon! It makes more sense than the movie, and it's more entertaining to boot.:::0:::None
Colombiana never successfully builds off the emotions established in its strong opening.:::0:::None
The promise of the borderline-priceless early scenes with Amandla Stenberg as the 10-year-old Cataleya aren't quite fulfilled by the more predictable set pieces with the adult assassin.:::0:::2.5/4
... predictable from first frame to last.:::0:::2/5
Colombiana, despite its many explosions and some howlingly wooden dialogue, is an eminently forgettable actioner.:::0:::1/5
The movie is like a lady who can't choose between two suitors: the campy and fun one, or the serious and cliche one.:::0:::2/5
Often improbable, sometimes ludicrous, but frequently exciting.:::1:::None
A generic time killer that doesn't leave any kind of lasting impression.:::0:::2/4
Gets off some fire-flashes of interest but nothing more sustained. The romance subplot is rote and there are some ludicrous moments. Ultimately, it seems hollow-point.:::0:::None
If you go into "Colombiana" expecting a glorified student film you will not be disappointed.:::0:::C-
We could be talking up Zoe Saldana as the next Angelina Jolie. But she's going to need a stronger vehicle than this to end Angie's reign.:::0:::None
Director Olivier Megaton has mastered the art of balancing absurdity with conviction, both in his montages and his choices on the soundtrack.:::1:::3/4
Possibly worth seeing if you are 13.:::0:::None
Saldana is in a Jolie mood and shows what a tough gal she can be. What we never get is enough knowledge of her character.:::0:::5/10
There's bad acting all around, but you can't fully blame the performers. The dialogue needed a writer to come in and punch it up - the lines sound like placeholders.:::0:::None
Wrapped in B-movie trappings from its cliched script and implausible scenarios to less than thrilling action, the best thing Colombiana has going for it is the lovely Ms. Saldana, who deserves much better than this.:::0:::2.5/5
Colombiana isn't the last word in action movies, but it's a fun ride.:::1:::2.5/4
Megaton blows things up, demolishes a fruit market, and throws in some parkour foot-chases as if he's completing a checklist.:::0:::2/4
Colombiana isn't completely dreadful, if you ignore the holes in its Swiss cheese of a plot.:::1:::2.5/4
It works well enough as a revenge movie, thanks to some good performances, some good action sequences and some Mission Impossible-like tactical operations.:::1:::B
When shortly into the film, Cataleya is escaping from a jail cell through an unsecured ventilation vent large enough for a person to easily fit through and that leads to the outside, I knew we were in trouble.:::0:::1.5/4
Luc Besson's pulp-fiction assembly line churns out another adequate ass-kicker with Colombiana, which boasts many of the French producer-director's favorite tropes.:::1:::2.5/4
Oozing female empowerment, acrobatic Zoe Saldana is the new action star to watch.:::1:::6/10
It desperately wants us to feel for Cataleya's lonely lot in life, especially when it trots out Johnny Cash's cover of "Hurt." But if it can't even spell the word "personal" correctly in its end credits, how can it possibly understand the definition?:::0:::1.5/4
We all love a steamy pile of frivolous nonsense now and then, but it has to move quickly or we lose interest, like a joke that stops being funny.:::0:::C
The star's dangerously low weight is only the start of its problems.:::0:::C-
. Presumably slapped together in a whirlwind of utter indifference while Besson was otherwise preoccupied, "Colombiana" is a bitter bon-bon of a film that even the most dedicated members of his cult will find difficult to swallow.:::0:::None
There's a reason this clunker is being buried at the end of August and wasn't screened for most critics -- it shouldn't screen for most audiences either.:::0:::1.0/5.0
The film is undercooked as a script, but Zoe Saldana commits to it with such ferocity that she makes it feel like everything matters, even when the script doesn't lay out a case for what that is.:::0:::C+
Columbiana is stupid, listless and too shy to be any fun. When you fail to make a well-armed, underwear-clad Zoe Saldana interesting, it seems almost intentional.:::0:::D
There have been some successes in the last few years following Besson's formula of stale dialogue, light character and strong action. But there have been far more misses than hits. Colombiana doesn't even stand out among those.:::0:::5.5/10
Thinly textured and technically proficient, with a cartoonishness that takes it out of the real world.:::0:::C+
It turns into the same silly stuff we've seen before, a dish of revenge served not so much cold as reheated.:::0:::C
Breaking no new ground, "Colombiana" more or less plays it straight.:::0:::None
Deprived of details, Megaton expects us to subsist on action alone, but it's not enough to fill the void left by the absence of story.:::0:::2.5/5
Focused primarily on the sex appeal of the actress, trusting that particular feminine posture will distract from a wobbly picture that consists of a series of vicious sketches bound together by a vague interest in revenge.:::0:::C
The best way to describe the action packed film 'Colombiana' is to say to that it's mindless, unpretentious, very stylized, and entertaining. It's your typical B film brought to the big screen by the power and influence of Luc Besson.:::1:::2.5/4
If you like stylized fights, spent shotgun shells hitting the floor in slow-mo, and things done blown up real good, Megaton's your man and this is your film. (Full Content Parental Review also available):::1:::None
escapism as exaggeration:::0:::2.5/5
Luc Besson keeps ralphing up scripts about beautiful lady killers, but that doesn't mean you have to keep seeing them.:::0:::0.5/4
Zoe Saldana makes being an action hero look so easy in "Colombiana," you have to wonder why more actresses don't try it.:::1:::3/5
Luc Besson has decided to make one for the girls.:::0:::2/4
Put Zoe Saldana in a catsuit and have her slithering around air conditioning ducts while techno music pumps and, basically, you've most of my attention.:::0:::C
A waste of time, talent and resources on a movie that would feel more at home in the direct-to-DVD aisle of your local big box store than on a multiplex marquee.:::0:::None
There's little to no care paid to anything outside of three or four action sequences -- and those will look just as good on home video. In five weeks.:::0:::2.5/5
After opening weekend, 'Colombiana' will more than likely be buried in the shallow grave of other femme fatale action duds like 'Aeon Flux,' 'Catwoman' and 'Elektra.':::0:::C
Colombiana is often preposterous but never boring.:::1:::B-
This is a showy flower of an action film. Saldana doesn't get much of a chance to emote, but her action skills blossom.:::1:::2.5/4
There are some early comic moments that have you laughing along with the movie, but eventually the clashing tones and preposterousness just have you laughing.:::0:::2/5
All killers should look this good doing their dirty work. It'd be a better world.:::1:::3.5/5
Genre action at its most generic, a thick pudding of all the usual rooftop chases, martial-artsy slap-ups, and improbably huge weaponry.:::0:::None
Is Saldana the new Schwarzenegger, only leaner, meaner and much better looking in spandex? I think so.:::1:::3.5/5
A movie so addicted to the crack pipe of delirious cinematic badness that it has real potential as a camp classic.:::0:::None
What leaves me deeply uncomfortable is the purely cinematic postscript Polanski tacks on to Yasmina Reza's play... It suggests that any moral outrage that erupts over a wrongdoing is wasted energy and anger...:::0:::None
Though repetitious, this photographed play is brutal, witty, funny and scary.:::1:::B+
Totally overrated- just like the play.:::0:::4/10
Involving portrait of two couples meeting to smooth out the rough edges of a mutual problem who wind up letting loose all the anger, disappointment, and hatred inside themselves.:::1:::4/5
A taut, laugh-out-loud comedy with four powerhouse performances.:::1:::None
Yes, this is an adaptation of one of those plays where loathsome well-to-do socialites of various flavors come together to methodically reveal just how loathsome they are.:::0:::C
This brutally edgy, biting comedy is slick, simmering and scathing - with a suitably ironic conclusion.:::1:::7/10
A vast improvement over its source material. The movie is tighter, less literal/pretentious in its staging, and--most importantly for a comedy--funnier...Christoph Waltz is a particular standout. One of the ten best films of 2011.:::1:::A-
In the mayhem-for-minutes stakes, few films can dream to live up to the sheer economy of Roman Polanski's deliciously acid-tongued 79-minute chamber piece.:::1:::3.5/5
Carnage is one of the funniest and most intelligent films of the year.:::1:::5/5
Foster, Reilly, Winslet and Waltz (four Oscar wins among them) share a preternatural gift for imbuing even the quietest moments with extraordinary, unconventional feeling.:::1:::3/4
Relatively light-hearted for a Polanski film (no one dies), Carnage is fun verbal warfare cleanly filmed.:::1:::4/5
Nobody makes a trapped-in-a-house-slowly-going-insane movie quite like Roman Polanski.:::1:::B
Great cast... all in the wrong roles. By singling out the characters and isolating them instead of letting them breathe as a group, Polanski kills the rhythm of the piece.:::0:::None
Polanski's interest in the play makes sense, but the real star of the show is the casting director.:::1:::None
... All is not as it seems and 18-year-old Scotch effectively loosens tongues and emotions. The movie is wickedly funny and Polanski clearly had a blast shooting it on a Paris set dressed to look like Brooklyn.:::1:::None
Offsets its familiar thematic arguments with deliciously nasty wit and fractured, tension-wracked visual framing.:::1:::B+
Brief, explosively funny, and sardonic as hell "Carnage" is what you might get if you condensed three of Woody Allen's early films into a 75 minute one-act. This movie is a kick.:::1:::B+
Fast, furious and often funny.:::1:::3/4
Roman Polanski ensures that Carnage's images, like its words, cut through us like a knife.:::1:::3/4
A quick and witty character-based piece showcasing four unquestionable talents.:::1:::7.5/10
Artistically, this farce is a minor film from Polanski whose ineffective effort to open up the play sacrifices its wit, tension, and tempo. Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly are miscast, but Winslet and Waltz are good.:::1:::C+
Snappy, nasty, deftly acted and perhaps the fastest paced film ever directed by a 78-year-old, this adaptation of Yasmina Reza's award-winning play God of Carnage fully delivers the laughs and savagery of the stage piece...:::1:::None
The acting comes at full throttle while the pacing cranks up the tension in agonising, incremental degrees.:::1:::4/5
It's well-acted and giddily enjoyable, if slightly less so once the characters start to analyse their descent into barbarism.:::1:::3/5
Celebrates an old-fashioned, underrated cinematic pleasure: the chance to see an ensemble cast of fine actors sparring with each other, and at the top of their game.:::1:::4/5
:::0:::None
:::0:::None
This high-stakes drama is infected with too many characters and a silly subplot.:::0:::2.0/5
This is a movie that will pound your pulse without having a pulse itself. It's quite proud of it.:::0:::C+
"As slick and polished as this "real" version of "28 Days Later" is, it's an utterly heartless affair.":::1:::2.5/4
What we end up with is a film that is not particularly bad, just one that seemed unnecessary since it's a story we've already seen many times before.:::0:::2.5/4
Contagion may be a case of feverishly good filmmaking (and an excellent, if slightly more high brow, addition to the disaster movie genre), but ultimately it will leave you with little besides an admiration for Soderbergh's artistry.:::1:::7.5/10
A drama of this magnitude deserves memorable, nuanced characters. [But] as a reminder that a single gust of panic can bring down civilization like a house of cards, it works.:::1:::B
Before Contagion is anything else, it's a master class in filmmaking - shooting, editing, making a movie move.:::1:::5/5
Soderbergh's detachment actually creates an effective air of understatement when working in tandem with the contrasting warmth and commitment of his cast.:::1:::3/4
If you're a hypochondriac or paranoid (or both), don't watch this film.:::1:::3/5
A bit emotionless and clinical, but Contagion is a pretty spot-on blow-by-blow of what it would be like if a real viral epidemic were to break out.:::1:::8/10
The fiercely intelligent Contagion outdoes its genre competition precisely because it doesn't dumb itself down for our sake.:::1:::4.5/5
Soderbergh, who is as skilled as they come at uplifting routine templates, gives the infection movie uber-A-list treatment.:::1:::2.5/4
At the heart of Contagion is the fear of a disease that can send the world into anarchy, a scenario which seems extreme but is actually dangerously realistic.:::1:::3/5
A first-rate cast, excellent acting, and a reasonably taut pace help a somewhat lackluster and sometimes melodramatic story line over its more-predictable soft spots.:::1:::6/10
No one becomes a zombie as in 28 Days Later but the trajectory here is about the same and 10 times more frightening because of its true-to-life, very probable scenario.:::1:::None
A supercharged cross between an episode of CSI and a World Health Organization infographic.:::1:::4/5
The disease/pandemic movie has grown up.:::1:::B
Steven Lederberg's realization of Scott Burns' original screenplay is more interesting for its statistics and protocols than gripping drama as the world comes to terms with a virus that threatens to remove one-in-twelve from the planet.:::0:::3/5
I'm not making this up: I had a coughing fit during 'Contagion.'Luckily, I was sitting at the very back of the theater, so I was less likely (I hope) to add to the tension unfolding on the screen.:::1:::3.5/4
Contagion is a reminder that we're hardly in as much control of the globe as we think.:::1:::4/5
As soon as you hear Gwyneth Paltrow cough, you know where you're headed.:::1:::None
Todo luce muy cool, demasiado para un film en el que la gente muere como moscas y en el que se pretende alertarnos sobre una inminente crisis global. Pero no hay tiempo para desarrollar interes emocional por ninguno de los personajes.:::0:::2/5
A paean to death by bat droppings mixed with a bit of pork.:::1:::7/10
A methodical exploration of the threat of pandemics and how we share space with our fellow human beings. If you aren't chilled by the potential, you should be.:::1:::3.5/4
Star-studded and well-directed pandemic story that offers style at the expense of thrills, any emotional connection, and at times, logic.:::0:::B-
In an exemplary cast, Matt Damon stands out as Paltrow's seemingly immune husband, as does Elliott Gould in an understated cameo.:::1:::3/5
It's Purell for the disaster movie movement. You may find yourself wishing for a little more grime and viscera.:::1:::3/5
[T]errifyingly credible... Foremost a detective story, with a science-positive bent...:::1:::None
This is slick, watchable stuff performed by an all-star ensemble...:::1:::None
Contagion's not the feel-good movie of the year, but it's effective, compelling and smart and will have you twitching at every cough you hear for days afterwards.:::1:::4/5
A surprisingly clinical work.... it asks each of us: what would I do, and would I be proud of it?:::1:::None
A concise and complex screenplay that is circular in structure and rarely lags as it canvasses the natural unravelling of society and the glue that bonds humanity together:::1:::None
Soderbergh keeps a cool head throughout, refraining from the tear-jerking storylines and cheesy emoting you typically get in disaster movies. You might not be groping for tissues, but you'll definitely be reaching for the anti-viral gel by the close.:::1:::None
In the end it feels a little like a Fincher wannabee, rather than boasting its an identity in itself.:::1:::3/5
A stunningly-made film guaranteed to send hypochondriacs into a frenzy.:::1:::4/5
Tension is palpable from the opening frames.:::1:::None
There is only one voice in Contagion and it is a rather empty one.:::0:::None
For the most part the star cast inject this with everything it needs to take root in your brain and have you edging away from anyone who coughs on the bus.:::1:::3/5
Steven Soderbergh's well-researched, convincing, courageously bleak drama about how a lethal virus could decimate the human race.:::1:::3/5
More likely to cause an outbreak of yawning, heavy eyelids and a compulsion to keep checking the time.:::0:::2/5
The all-star disaster-movie genre is taken out of the 1970s and given a stylish and largely persuasive 21st century makeover by director and cinematographer Steven Soderbergh.:::1:::3/5
Contagion presents a frightening reality, and leaves you with something to think about.:::1:::3/5
An intelligent, emotionally driven ensemble film that we have come to expect from Soderbergh.:::1:::None
The film wraps up tightly and somewhat too quickly, but it's a delight to experience Soderbergh at the top of his game.:::1:::3.5/5
It's terrific. I was really impressed with this film and I think it's one of the best things he's done actually.:::1:::4.5/5
This almost documentary-like film is dramatic without being melodramatic. I was impressed with the almost existential approach of Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Z. Burns.:::1:::4/5
Think of Wolfgang Petersen's magnificently entertaining 1995 virus-on-the-rampage adventure Outbreak, take out the drama, excitement and involving characters, and that's Contagion in a nutshell.:::0:::1/5
The film addresses its grim subject in a cool, matter-of-fact way.:::1:::3.5/5
Contagion is what happens when a disaster movie gets sent to the headmaster for bad behaviour.:::1:::4/5
While Contagion would never be classified as entertaining or enlightening, it does make an impact.:::1:::3/5
Ever the cerebral essayist, Soderbergh isn't in this for edge-of-your-seat thrills - his approach is more cold sweat than burning fever.:::1:::3/5
The movie fights for something important: the right of stars to look worse than we do.:::1:::3/5
Another Soderbergh studio job well done.:::1:::3/5
Simultaneously gripping and emotionally engaging thanks to pacey direction, a smart script and terrific performances from a fine ensemble cast.:::1:::4/5
Lean and fast-moving, Soderbergh ratchets up the tension without straining credibility while the days tick away and the body count rises.:::1:::4/5
A highly watchable film, terrifying in its realism. We can just imagine these events panning out.:::1:::4/5
A chilling, meticulously researched thriller...:::1:::3/5
A level-headed take on a topic that's often an excuse for madness and melodrama.:::1:::3/5
Compelling and terrifyingly real, Contagion balances its multitude of characters, scenarios and fascinating ideas with steadiness and lethal efficiency.:::1:::4.5/5
Though the 'case study' approach may not be satisfying for all, Contagion offers a fresh look at the way in which our fragile ecosystem teeters on extinction, without resorting to overblown theatrics or skyscraper-demolishing pyrotechnics.:::1:::4/5
Adopting a clean, chronological and punchy approach, Soderbergh holds a steady eye on panic and chaos. It's a disaster movie with a brain and conscience.:::1:::4/5
A starkly effective ensemble drama which could well do for the sniffles what Jaws did for great whites.:::1:::4/5
Plays like a humorless send-up of all-star disaster pictures:::0:::None
Contagion is, by and large, about as enthralling and compelling as a typical episode of CSI: Miami.:::0:::2/4
Soderbergh applies his brainier brand of filmmaking to the global outbreak thriller genre, and the result is a hugely gripping blockbuster that never talks down to its audience.:::1:::4/5
If you're looking for some kind of poetry-some exalted dramatic arc that lifts this narrative out of the ordinary-you won't find it here. Contagion is...gripping from start to finish.:::1:::None
Shot with documentary grimness, the movie's relative realism is less dramatically persuasive than the go-for-broke B-movie hysteria of such hydrophobic predecessors as Romero's 'The Crazies' and Cronenberg's 'Shivers.':::1:::3/4
Elliot Gould!? What, were George Segal and Ryan ONeal unavailable? Was it "free cheese day" at the celebrity shelter?:::0:::C-
Contagion shows us that "working together" is still possible, still necessary. And in a world as divided and partisan as ours, that's an encouragement we need to receive.:::1:::3.5/4
This is sophisticated, 21st century filmmaking, with a probing techno score - yet there is an unmistakable '70s disaster flick feel about it.:::1:::B-
Contagion is a movie about flawed people doing their jobs, and doing them well, under unspeakable conditions.:::1:::8/10
... low-key in its approach with an unforced ring of truth ...:::1:::4/5
If Hollywood and B-horror films sensationalize the problem of a global outbreak of a lethal virus, Contagion brings a calm reasoned voice to the subject.:::1:::None
Gets off to a very strong start, but eventually gets bogged down in questionable plotting and weak characterization.:::0:::1.5/5
CONTAGION demonstrates that science fiction can be used in film for a more serious purpose than telling a superhero story.:::1:::8/10
A well-made, effective chiller...I would have admired and respected it better, though, if it wasn't so subtly judgmental toward (Gwyneth) Paltrow's "patient zero" character.:::1:::B
A frighteningly realistic depiction of just how fast a new form of an old plague can take root and spread -- and how all our know-how can be caught off-guard.:::1:::3.5
The rest of this Steven Soderbergh movie is a chilled down, anti-hysterical, smartly-schlocky shout-out to '70s disaster/paranoia films.:::1:::3/5
Watching this film is as uncomfortable as expected, so if you have even the slightest tendency towards hypochondria, you should stay far away.:::1:::3.5/5
Contagion is a clear-eyed vision of a potential, modern horror that shows science in battle. The direction by Steven Soderbergh is deft and sharp. The screenplay by Scott Z. Burns is intelligent and not exploitative.:::1:::3.0/5
It's like Wolfgang Petersen's Outbreak minus the monkey and with more than two functioning brain cells.:::1:::4/5
Soderbergh keeps the incessantly yellow-tinted film lithe and jaunty, moving us quickly amid various subplots while also racheting up the tensions.:::1:::3/4
Writer Scott Z. Burns has fashioned a reality-based thriller that could easily come true..casting is superb, from Fishburne, Cotillard and Winslet to biologist Ehle and snaggle-toothed misinformation blogger Law, who gives my profession a very bad name.:::1:::B
Strong acting, atmospheric direction, and a nail-biting premise add up to a movie whose impact is hard to ignore.:::1:::3/4
Why did Contagion have to be such an antiseptic thriller?:::1:::2.5/4
Contagion has one goal in mind, and it meets this goal fantastically well, but it does virtually nothing else.:::1:::7/10
It seems we have had this plot a million times before and this movie offers nothing new or involving.:::0:::5/10
"Contagion" is a strong film to kick off the end of summer...just make sure you know who you're sharing your popcorn with!:::1:::4/5
For patient viewers, prepare to let this film infect your nerves.:::1:::3/4
A horror film without a safety release valve, because the fears it plants in our brains aren't the kind that can be chased away by the light of day.:::1:::7.8/10
The presence of movie stars helps: their authority is part of what keeps us fascinated by the gruesome fable, juicing it a bit, so that we can actually enjoy it.:::1:::None
It's an adult movie that will make you not want to touch any adults when it's over.:::1:::7/10
Steven Soderbergh's lean, fast-paced medical thriller 'Contagion' doesn't have much heart, but it has plenty of suspense and drama.:::1:::B
A thinking person's disaster movie.:::1:::None
If Sound It Out never really digs its claws into its material, it at least approaches it with a careful level of thought and commitment.:::1:::2.5/4
Offering the best thrills of 2011, "Contagion" will have audience viewers rapidly spreading the word, much like the virus.:::1:::5/5
A portrait of the terrifying fragility of the tangled biological, social and emotional networks that govern our lives.:::1:::B+
Contagion is compelling.:::1:::None
The most gut-grabbing non-zombie pandemic thriller I've seen, and that's aside from feeling a tickling sensation in the back of my throat through the first two acts.:::1:::4.5/5
You'll want to make a beeline for the nearest restroom to wash your hands ... plays like a feature-length public service announcement, a duck-and-cover-your-mouth drill.:::1:::3/4
With so many tales to tell, Contagion just can't possibly deliver on every one of its promises.:::0:::B-
Gripping from start to finish.:::1:::3.5/4
Uneven nightmare disaster thriller.:::1:::B
Soderbergh's Contagion offers little new about fear and horror but his behind-the-camera ability to be fresh -- along with help from an all-star cast -- elevates his thriller from boredom, if only just slightly.:::1:::2.5/5
'Contagion' is an ambitious and well-meaning film. However, despite some fine performances, it fails to deliver the type of thrills and suspense promised in those exciting previews.:::0:::None
Soderbergh's cold style is oddly suited to this kind of story, that of a virus impersonally killing a hefty percentage of all who come into contact with it:::1:::4/5
Unlike slasher films which may or may not raise the hairs on the back of your neck, "Contagion" is frightening because it is totally possible --- it all comes down to the "wrong pig and the wrong bat".:::1:::None
This movie will do for bar peanuts what "Jaws" did for swimming in the ocean.:::1:::None
This is solid, intelligent filmmaking that will have you on the edge of your seat...:::1:::5/5
Contagion is the best movie made to date about an epidemic/pandemic.:::1:::3/4
...only a few of the stories compel and even the reliable Matt Damon fails to make a strong impression. "Contagion" is an OK medical thriller, but there's something off about it.:::0:::C+
An entertaining if unwieldy cross between a PSA and one of those all-star idiocies from the 1970s -- those disaster flicks involving hijacked planes, hurtling meteors or towering infernos.:::1:::2.5/4
It feels very stripped down and authentic and finely crafted.:::1:::4/5
With Contagion, Soderbergh empties his entire bag of tricks and keeps this lean, emotional thriller from turning into an unwieldy, clunky mess.:::1:::4/5
It proves the creepiest movies are also the quietest. Although "Contagion" is a horror movie, it's also a response about a viral apocalypse. The end arrives with tiny coughs ...:::1:::3/4
Along with the stars, Contagion has plenty of scares, though in contrast to Matt Damon and Kate Winslet, they're things you encounter every day.:::1:::3/4
There's something very clinical about the way Soderbergh presents the story. But, just when you think it's going to become some kind of docu-drama, the director slams you back to the ground with human emotion and suffering. Paul Chambers, CNN, Atlanta.:::1:::A-
Contagion becomes a battle between what it is and what it could have been. It satisfies just enough to warrant its existence while frustrating one with its potential.:::1:::3/5
The film resembles its viral subject a little too closely: an intricate, formidable mechanism with no evident purpose.:::1:::None
A smart and fascinating bio-thriller that needs a little more humanity.:::1:::3.5/5
Steven Soderbergh's Contagion, written by Scott Burns, begins on a state of high alert and stays there for the rest of the movie.:::1:::B
I can't call Contagion as a feel-good movie. In fact, you won't want to be feeling anything-or anyone-after seeing this cautionary tale about the spread of a deadly virus. But you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen...:::1:::None
[A] curiously inert new thriller from Steven Soderbergh.:::1:::C+
Steven Soderbergh&#8203;'s viral "who brung it" is a mostly style-over-substance affair.:::0:::2/4
Contagion could have been a blood-curdling scream; instead it comes off as Soderbergh's star-powered science project.:::0:::C+
A very entertaining, well-acted and palpably taut piece of propaganda that leaves too little room for interpretation.:::1:::7.1/10
All-star virus thriller is intense, uncompromising.:::1:::4/5
It's the dark comic moments and the film's sci-fi, B-movie, race-to-develop-a-vaccine subplot that prevent Contagion from being a gloomy two hours in the dark. That and Soderbergh's delight in characters.:::1:::3/4
Seeing Contagion in a crowded theatre is like watching Jaws on a life raft. Bring hand sanitizer. Or bleach. And maybe soap and a bucket of warm water.:::1:::4/5
While the all-star cast and the story, about a deadly virus, sounds similar to 1995's Outbreak, 'Contagion' is more insightful, moving, and disturbing with first rate entertainment.:::1:::3/4
Contagion offers a healthy dose of smart filmmaking while most of Hollywood is serving up cinematic placebos.:::1:::3/4
Contagion is a thrill that gets under your skin and keeps you on your toes. In fact, you may start curling up in your seat just to keep a distance from the person sitting next to you.:::1:::85/100
If Contagion is a "horror movie," as Soderbergh has described it, then you can think of it as the most believable zombie movie ever made.:::1:::None
As an intellectual exercise, it remains compulsively fascinating.:::1:::B
Thanks to Contagion, I used a paper towel to open a bathroom door the other day and now I'm washing my hands more often. One of the scariest movies in years!:::1:::4/5
Contagion is one of the most informative, talk-heavy, films since Inception and The Social Network, but it isn't the most entertaining from a blockbuster standpoint.:::1:::7/10
Killing off one of your marquee actresses appeals to that not-insignificant portion of the moviegoing population that is, shall we say, weary of Paltrow.:::0:::2/5
Even though it deals with a serious subject seriously, this is an entertaining, believable movie.:::1:::9/10
By focusing in on just a few individuals and letting the rest of the story unfold in the background Soderbergh makes a micro experience into a macro one.:::1:::8.6/10
Very effective, mixing science and timely issues into one terrifically compelling drama...[with an effective] emotional payoff.:::1:::3/4
Contagion is just about as exciting as your last inoculation but makes less sense.:::0:::3/5
The movie plays as if the National Institutes of Health hired director Steven Soderbergh to direct a health warning public service announcement that would scare the heck out of everyone.:::1:::3/4
Contagion is an exceptionally well-crafted film, one that feels frighteningly realistic despite the movie star cast.:::1:::None
You'll never hear a cough the same way again.:::1:::B-
If you're the type of person who finds the opening credits montage the most frightening aspect of Romero's original Dawn of the Dead, you will absolutely lose your mind during Contagion.:::1:::A-
Decent, but not completely viral.:::1:::B-
An unusually immersive filmgoing experience, no 3-D effects necessary.:::1:::4/4
The whole thing feels maddeningly incomplete. We get only the sketchiest of characters. (Parental Movie Review also available):::0:::None
If this is an action-thriller, it's one that makes med school look sexier than the Marines.:::0:::2/4
For the most part, the movie is like the virus it depicts: Once this queasily entertaining movie grabs you, it has you in its power.:::1:::3.5/4
The rush of A-listers combined with apocalyptic dread creates its own kind of dizzy pleasure: Who's going down next on this Poseidon Adventure?:::1:::4/5
Contagion may be the most expensive public-service ad ever filmed, but it's also a surprisingly light-on-its-feet action thriller.:::1:::3/4
Steven Soderbergh is given the opportunity to scare us and it is the calm with which he does it that should frighten us all the more.:::1:::3.5/4
It's the most fun you'll have involving something deadly and contagious.:::1:::B+
Contagion is effective because it plays not on our fears of fictional boogeymen and monsters, but on actual threats.:::1:::B
Contagion keeps us at a distance: Rarely has the death of millions seemed so inconsequential.:::0:::2.5/4
It's hard to know just what director Steven Soderbergh was thinking in making Contagion. The movie, about the outbreak of a mysterious and deadly new disease, feels oddly mistimed.:::0:::2/4
[An] intellectually stimulating new drama about the terrifyingly rapid spread of a lethal virus.:::1:::None
Scarier than any traditional horror film you're likely to see.:::1:::8/10
The film plays like a hi-tech version of cheesy 1950s sci-fi fare of the Quatermass or Invasion Of The Body Snatchers variety.:::0:::2/5
Takes great pains to present its situations realistically, and includes a lot of intelligent speculation about what sort of political, economic and ethical questions would be raised by such a disaster.:::1:::3/4
Sobering reality for our interconnected world.:::1:::2.5/4
You will want to bathe in hand sanitizer for a week after seeing Contagion.:::1:::3.5/4
The third act will seem anticlimactic by comparison, but it's tough to fault a movie, especially one about a deadly virus, for being too grounded.:::1:::3.5/5
Frighteningly believable, businesslike, super-smart and never less than riveting.:::1:::3/4
Contagion is more unsettling than 1995's Outbreak or the disaster movies of the '70s.:::1:::2.5/4
Contagion is certainly the most realistic portrayal of a global pandemic I've seen, but that doesn't make it the most entertaining, or even all that intellectually interesting.:::0:::2/5
The most terrifying aspect of Contagion, ultimately, is the plausibility of its premise. Meticulous and low-key, the film reminds us that disaster lies in the most mundane interactions.:::1:::None
Delivers the gripping, tick-tock tale of an epidemic that threatens to destroy civilization, but presents it virtually without comment.:::1:::None
Unnerving imagery and an A-list ensemble boost the disease pic's potency, but Contagion isn't immune to the unfocused, overambitious story, which diminishes its impact.:::1:::B-
Though modern in its style and gloss, Steven Soderbergh's "Contagion" has the feeling - the welcome feeling - of one of those epic disaster movies from the 1970s.:::1:::3/4
If this truly is the beginning of the end of Soderbergh's career, it tells you all on its own how big a loss that will be to the cinema.:::1:::B+
Steven Soderbergh's grim and gripping medical thriller has arrived and it's guaranteed to turn you into a hypochondriac.:::1:::3/4
Hypochondriacs might want to steer clear of "Contagion." Others should find this procedural thriller about the outbreak of a deadly disease to be an informative, disquieting and mildly entertaining experience.:::1:::2.5/4
A tense, first-rate thriller that will have you running for the soap and water once the end credits start rolling.:::1:::B+
More a cinematic autopsy than an affecting drama--a cool, detached dissection of an enormous human tragedy; and while it certainly succeeds as a semi-documentary account, it fails to deliver a strong emotional punch.:::0:::C+
Soderbergh takes the unusual step, for a big Hollywood production, of killing off Gwyneth Paltrow very near the beginning of the story.:::1:::None
I couldn't look away, and neither did I touch my face with my hands.:::1:::B+
A smart, spare and well-crafted adult-oriented drama that never takes the intelligence of its audience for granted with phony scares, goopy gross-outs or a storyline that requires its participants to act like idiots in order to keep things moving along.:::1:::5/5
As ruthlessly effective as the malady at its cool, cool center.:::1:::4/5
Makes unflattering comparisons between the rampaging virus and the toxic spread of unreliable information via the Internet.:::1:::B-
By the time this globe-hopping, movie-star-crammed disaster saga - directed with petrifying efficiency by Steven Soderbergh - comes full circle, you'll never want to touch a subway pole or elevator button or ATM again.:::1:::3/4
All this germ procedural offers is the sight of people behaving badly, willing to do their worst to get first dibs on a vaccine. Sadly, that's no surprise.:::1:::2.5/4
An absorbing, nuanced, and intelligent film about a global pandemic in which Soderbergh shows how the battle against a deadly virus draws out the best and the worst in human beings.:::1:::4/5
Soderbergh himself has modestly likened "Contagion" to a '70s-style, star-driven disaster film. But it's smarter than that, and a lot closer to medical thrillers like "The Andromeda Strain.":::1:::3.5/4
This may not fit any conventional definition of entertainment, but it certainly keeps your eyes on the screen.:::1:::3.5/5
the Traffic of outbreak movies:::1:::4.5/5
"Contagion" will do for hand sanitizer what "Jaws" did for shark repellent.:::1:::4/4
While it's fleet on its feet and steady in its tension, Contagion is an exceptionally dry-eyed movie about mass death, interested more in how the structures we've built to keep order deal with the disaster than how people handle it emotionally.:::1:::8.5/10
As he did in his 2000 film "Traffic," director Steven Soderbergh weaves together multiple perspectives in a seamlessly edited collage.:::1:::3/4
Big ideas and small-mindedness threaten to turn "Contagion'' into unwieldy world-affairs and family-values allegories, but Soderbergh and Burns are moving too fast to think.:::1:::3/4
[It] can't exactly be called a pleasure of any kind, but it is quietly compelling, building the tension as methodically as its characters chip away at the medical puzzle.:::1:::3/4
There's a sense of dread in "Contagion," but it never spreads to us. When Day 1 is finally shown, it makes you want to eat better, which isn't the same as saying this is a great movie.:::0:::2/5
"Contagion" is a thoughtful, provocative and ultimately chilling film.:::1:::None
Taut with energy from start to finish, Contagion's portrait of a global epidemic is just the right mix of scary, informative and emotionally powerful.:::1:::None
I didn't care about any of the characters, especially happy-go-lucky Patient Zero.:::0:::None
Part human drama, part mystery, and part technical babble about viral mutations, and, with that wide breadth of concentration, each element falls short.:::0:::2/4
Running less than two hours but as packed with incredible actors and subplots as an Irwin Allen disaster pic, and yet Soderbergh never lets it get away from him. We always care. We're always interested. We're always terrified.:::1:::4.5/5.0
This paranoia-fest is, at its heart, a straightforward ticking-clock thriller. And it generates about all the suspense you can hope for from a movie with a faceless, microscopic antagonist.:::1:::2.5/4
Much more compelling when showing what it takes to confront a huge, unexpected problem, not merely how susceptible we are to sickness and chaos.:::1:::3/4
determinate accents who are periodically shot, knifed, garroted, run over, blown up and eaten alive.:::0:::None
Along with a spectacularly physical performance by Zaldana, Colombiana features some of the best frame-for-frame shots you will see this year.:::1:::7.5/10
Despite its borderline campiness and arrested adolescent mentality, Colombiana succeeds in delivering the goods as a fun albeit formulaic action flick that's most notable for Zoe Saldana's stone-cold yet still sexy performance.:::1:::3 stars
As a solidly entertaining piece of trashy exploitation its only drawback is a PG-13 rating.:::1:::3.5/5
While most action films fall apart because they succumb to stupidity, Colombiana suffers most because it tries to be too smart.:::0:::2.5/5
The results are so clumsy and over-the-top that they should have just called the movie Panty Assassin and played the whole thing for laughs.:::0:::None
For the most part, it's all big and silly, but at least it's enjoyably staged and crafted.:::1:::2.5/4
Colombiana may not be the brainiest of actioners, but one of the merits of producer Luc Besson's latest brainchild is that fanboys worldwide will come away with a scrap of horticultural knowledge as well as a pretty good time.:::1:::None
There are guilty pleasures to be had in this frenzied B starring Zoe Saldana, who gives an acrobatic performance that makes the overcooked material watchable.:::1:::None
An action-packed distraction for popcorn munchers who found the dialogue and plot points in Transformers: Dark Of The Moon too subtle.:::0:::None
What it had going for it was an uncanny and moving relationship between Gosling and Mulligan.:::1:::None
This is pop art of the highest degree.:::1:::A-
Hands down the coolest film of 2011, Drive is a stylised genre film where the genre is constantly changing.:::1:::4/5
Something under the hood of Drive captured my heart; director Nicolas Winding Refn has admirably crafted a fine piece of retro-noir cinema.:::1:::A+
Neither overblown action movie or intimate character study, Drive is somewhere in between - my approximation of "an arthouse Fast & Furious" wasn't too wide of the mark after all.:::1:::4/5
Nicolas Winding Refn's atmosperic direction, Gosling's sheer presence and a soundtrack that's perfection make Drive a fantastic film.:::1:::10/10
With a titanic infusion of pound-feet of torque, Drive is the best movie of 2011, a raging race that's part F1 and equal part demolition derby.:::1:::A+
If Sofia Coppola were a dude making genre action movies to impress Quentin Tarantino ... those movies would be a lot like this.:::1:::B+
Drive is surprising in many ways, from its quietly spoken first act through its increasingly violent and unexpected trajectory.:::1:::4/5
It's a slow-burn romantic fairy tale that suddenly turns dark and very violent, but director Nicholas Winding Refn is a master at developing suspense and menace, and every frame of this movie is dripping with both.:::1:::3.5/4
A classic tale of revenge, love and madness is given a refreshing polish and shine by director Nicolas Winding Refn. Drive is one of the year's very best.:::1:::10/10
Nicholas Winding Refn's 'neon-noir' heist film Drive winds the speedo back 25 years to honour the spirit of 80s action films, but this fable about fast cars and mob violence isn't afraid to show its feminine side.:::1:::4/5
... celebrates -- one might say revels in -- the pulp mythology of existential anti-heroes and criminal chivalry and street opera tragedy of American movies.:::1:::None
Delivers the thrilling action goods with craft and distinctive style.:::1:::3.5/4
Young directors would do well to take a cue or two from Refn when it comes to telling an engrossing story, because when a filmmaker with real vision is at the wheel, even the familiar can feel fresh, new, and exciting.:::1:::3.5/4
The real star of this film is the direction of cult Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn, making his Hollywood debut.:::1:::None
"Drive" is not the "Fast and Furious" knockoff you might think it is based on the advertising. It is far more artistic and thoughtful than any of those films could ever hope to be. Consider it a thinking man's action movie.:::1:::A
Action and smarts don't necessarily go hand-in-hand. But director Nicolas Winding Refn ('Bronson') deftly blends them in 'Drive,' a phenomenally entertaining movie that employs a haunting soundtrack, clever direction and entertaining characters.:::1:::4/4
A firecracker up the backside of the bloated modern action movie...:::1:::5/5
Drive's most striking movie reference might be the one where you're watching Irene watch the Driver enact an especially awful beat-down. It's a moment that's at once frightening, tragic, and not startling enough.:::1:::None
It's a film that has its finger on the pulse of what's current and in style, and one that has solidified its place as the coolest film of the year.:::1:::5/5
That rare film that can shock both with its uncommonly cool style and chillingly raw substance.:::1:::B+
This isn't a movie about action, it's a movie about fate, coincidence, and penance before the clock runs out.:::1:::None
A deliberately paced hybrid of high and low art, one that burns ice-cold with meticulous steadicam shots and hypnotic slow-motion, effortless coolness and stylish intelligence.:::1:::5/5
Drive works if you succumb to its broad brush strokes of emotion, the plot propelled by vague ambition and greed, the lush cinematography and the dreamy 80s inspired synthesiser soundtrack.:::1:::None
One of this year's most original, entertaining and frankly shocking American movies.:::1:::None
What Drive is trying to do is very clear, but clear intent doesn't forgive a film that's mostly flat.:::0:::3/5
The film then, with its elegant style evoking an eighties neon-drenched aesthetic, succeeds effortlessly at blending striking ultra-violence with the screenplays more ponderous sequences of blossoming romance.:::1:::8/10
If you can make it through one viewing, I dare say Drive is a film you're going to want to watch again and again.:::1:::A-
Ultra-violent, ultra-tedious, bargain-basement rip-off of the classic 1978 Walter Hill film The Driver.:::0:::1/5
Drive, above all else, reminds us why Gosling has been hailed as the new Sean Penn, or even a 21st-century Brando. He is outstanding.:::1:::9/10
It is ironic how much filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn uses the brakes in pacing this noirish art house thriller:::1:::None
A gripping heist thriller with a difference, Drive relies on subtleties, surprises and shocks as it keeps the audience engrossed:::1:::None
A laboratory distillation, but a fairly ravishing one:::1:::None
While you could lean back and nod along to Refn's posturing, the film plays more like an exercise in turn-of-the-Eighties nostalgia, a movie-length strong-silent swagger inspired by the art on a VHS box.:::0:::None
That rarity of rarities, an arty actioner that requires almost no excuses.:::1:::None
Refn's style is to draw out scenes to make a slow film punctuated with strong violence.:::1:::6/10
The film treats the audience with intelligence; it doesn't lay everything out and instead leaves you to do a little legwork too.:::1:::4/5
Terrific, pulpy stuff.:::1:::None
...the film's irresistibly stylish atmosphere [compensates] for its general lack of context and substance.:::1:::3/4
Punctuates its long stretches of cool, carefully calculated menace with splattery spasms of shocking violence.:::1:::3.5/5
full review at Movies for the Masses:::1:::5/5
A more or less conventional Los Angeles-set hot-rod/getaway-driver movie with neo-noir decoration -- albeit satisfying enough on its own terms.:::1:::None
One for fans of Taxi Driver and TV's Dexter, Drive is a film whose considerable style at first obscures just how much it'll get under your skin and stay there for weeks to come.:::1:::4.5/5
From its opening shots, Refn's movie is as cool and controlled as its protagonist... at once unhurriedly stylish and intensely gripping. You'd like to lean back and admire, but the action keeps pulling you to the edge of your seat.:::1:::5/5
High-octane excitement for the art-house set ... Think 'Two-Lane Blacktop' meets Kubrick's 'The Killing' meets Bresson ... Gosling's King of Cool may be the new McQueen.:::1:::3.5/4
Like the novels of Raymond Chandler and the paintings of David Hockney, Drive is both an accurate view of southern California's intoxicating sleaze and glamour and the filtering of it through a European sensibility.:::1:::None
A film that moves relentlessly forward, carrying you along so completely that it's only afterwards, if at all, that you begin to wonder about origins and plausibilities.:::1:::4/5
In proving that less is more, Rifn has sent out a message to Hollywood in this age of austerity.:::1:::4/5
Like watching rats fight in a gorgeously lit bucket, this is compellingly nasty, but for those with stomach for it, Drive is a lot of fun.:::1:::4/5
An artful, impressively made film, and one sure to excite cinephiles, everyday adrenaline junkies, and fans of stylized car chases set to an indie synthpop soundtrack.:::1:::3/4
An unusually upscale, and surprisingly satisfying, action film.:::1:::3/4
The tension is agonising... then rubber burns, the engine revs and we hold on tight. For the next 90 minutes, we don't let go.:::1:::None
Hold on tight and prepare for the ride of your life.:::1:::None
Winding Refn steals with such intelligence and thoughtfulness that there is a boldness and creativity to the film even though hardly a single moment of it is "original" in any way.:::1:::8/10
Gosling gives a laconic, sexy, quietly charming performance evocative of Steve McQueen, as a Hollywood stuntman who moonlights as a getaway driver.:::1:::4/5
Weighted with steely silences and sudden explosions of graphic violence, Drive confronts and dismantles our expectations with a hardened confidence that is all too rare in contemporary Hollywood filmmaking:::1:::4/4
A juggernaut of emotion that tentatively and unknowingly builds up speed then knocks you for six with some uncompromising and ultra-violent scenes.:::1:::4/5
Drive is a masterpiece of surface over depth. Catnip for anyone who thinks cinema is for the eye rather than the brain or heart.:::1:::3/5
Even when the screen goes berserk - a face splintering under a stamping heel, a master-crook attacking a defenceless colleague's features with a knife and fork - director Refn doesn't blink or expect us to.:::1:::3/5
By no means perfect, although it's hard to process the flaws while your insides are singing and you can't catch your breath.:::1:::3/5
Gosling exudes Steve McQueen-esque cool but there's not enough going on under the bonnets of these characters to justify the laboured, pretentious execution.:::1:::3/5
Drive is a movie with power but is still directionless; the acceleration is great, but the steering needs looking at.:::1:::3/5
Stylishly directed and superbly written, this is an achingly cool, pulse-pounding thriller with a terrific central performance from Ryan Gosling. Great soundtrack too.:::1:::4/5
One of the year's best.:::1:::4.75/5
...a wonderfully made movie, with terrific performances enhanced by tension-filled music, unfortunately marred by prolific unnecessary, eye-averting, graphic violence.:::1:::9/10
It's not too cool to use a girlie font in the opening credits, or to let us feel the hero's nerves as he audibly adjusts his leather driving gloves.:::1:::9/10
One of the best films of the year.:::1:::4/5
Expertly directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, nothing seems wasted. Every scene is lean and to the point.:::1:::B
It takes a while for the carburetor-noir thriller Drive to get revved up. But when its enigmatic hero slams his foot on the gas pedal (and a bad guy's face), this movie barrels into a space that modern action movies have long abandoned.:::1:::B
Sure, it's shallow, but it's also slickly compelling, beautifully crafted and so damn shiny.:::1:::4/5
It's rare to feel such a unique tone with such an ordinary idea. Gosling, Brooks and 'A Real Hero' all shine in this great film.:::1:::9/10
A brilliant work of art that's bold, daring and unpredictable.:::1:::5/5
In grabbing our attention, [Refn] diverts it from what matters. The horror lingers and seeps; the feelings are sponged away.:::0:::None
Remember Drive Angry...? (I hope you don't.) This is not that movie... This is Drive Calm. This is Drive Cool.:::1:::None
Stylish to the point of insanity, Refn's film somehow manages the whole '80s neo-noir' thing without being even slightly irritating.:::1:::None
Oh alright, it ain't Shane. But it is about as much shamelessly disreputable, stylish, ultra-violent fun you're going to have at the movies this year.:::1:::4/5
It is the autumn's first golden boy after a summer of lightweight superhero fare, but is truly no richer in thought or spirit than the shallowest comic-book flick.:::0:::2/5
Refn accomplishes the near impossible in modern movies: combining uncompromising art-house style with the real potential for mass-market accessibility, in a pitch-perfect blend of pulp narrative and pure cinema.:::1:::10/10
Provided you have a strong stomach for gore, don't miss this novel cinematic treat offering both an adrenaline fix and a compelling love story.:::1:::4/4
Moody and mystical at the start, this movie explodes with violence which shakes its audience to the core.:::1:::6/10
I think it was a master acting class, honestly...the violence was amazing. It's not going to be for everyone but it's definitely worth seeing!:::1:::A-
Refn's film is by no means a remake of Hill's The Driver but it's a definite kindred soul. Refn is like a jazz artist riffing on a colleague's composition and delivering a product that still manages to be totally his own.:::1:::None
Fascinating cinematography and a riveting performance by Ryan Gosling elevate 'Drive' above many other heist-gone-wrong movies.:::1:::None
Winner of the Best Director prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival, "Drive" is a stylish film that doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it a thriller? A romance? A heist film? All of the above? To be honest, I really don't know:::0:::2.5/5
A unique blend of classical tropes and modern filmmaking.:::1:::B+
so possessed by the motion in its pictures --even its frozen tableaus are alive with the threat of movement -- it immediately joins the pantheon of Cinema's Coolest Movies:::1:::A
The talented Danish filmmaker revs up the action sequences and violence and outdoes the Americans in their specialty of sleazy pulp fiction.:::1:::B+
My hands are a little dirty, too.:::1:::4/4
The entire supporting roster is strong, although Albert Brooks deserves his own standing ovation. The nebbish from Broadcast News and Lost in America has been reconfigured as a slow-burning sadist, and it's a sight to chill the spine.:::1:::3/4
Atmospheric, refreshingly intelligent and suspenseful with a well-nuanced performance by Ryan Gosling. It's one of the most invigorating thrillers of the year because it offers both style and substance.:::1:::9.145/10
An artsy, self-conscious, existentialist stillness reigns - or, more accurately, tedium. Hyper-stylish, it idles in, then stalls out.:::0:::4/10
Ends up taking the overly familiar and manages to send it down a road that ends up feeling new and unexplored. (Parental Movie Review also available):::1:::None
Moody, atmospheric and filled with twists.:::1:::3/5
It is beyond being cool. It is ice cold.:::1:::3.5/5
But while major elements of the core setup are common and generic the resulting film is anything but... Drive is pure genius in a white satin jacket.:::1:::A-
Based on the James Sallis novel, this lean, stylish thriller is confidently assembled to pull us into an outrageous series of events.:::1:::4.5/5
A delectable mix of brooding arthouse and heist-gone-to-hell genre picture.:::1:::4/5
The story is nothing terribly new, but it's presented in a fantastic way, making it one of the most smartly directed movies I've seen this year.:::1:::4.5/5
It's probably not the film that the trailer would lead you to believe that it is. I think it tries to be more than that and I don't think it makes it.:::0:::2.5/5
A potentially silly movie that wins its legitimacy through sheer force of confident, mellow attitude. And Gosling is simply great.:::1:::4.5/5
A hypnotic and mesmerizing mash-up of Friedkin, Mann and Lynch. In case there were any remaining doubts, after having danced around and avoided it for several years, Ryan Gosling is now taking the bullet train to stardom.:::1:::5/5
A thin plot is outweighed by a masterful visual style, a dream cast and some truly great cinematic moments.:::1:::4.5/5
I did not care for the slow pace or the finalization of "Drive" but with Gosling's solid performance and scenes that reminisce of "The Departed" it is worth a quick viewing if you can stand the blood & guts.:::1:::3/5
You've seen this movie before, but you've never seen it like this.:::1:::4.5/5
A daring work. More than once, I got little chills running up my spine from the audaciousness with which director Nicolas Winding Refn tells the tale.:::1:::4/4
For me, Drive is all attitude, punctuated by unpleasant bursts of violence. If that's what passes for cutting-edge filmmaking, or storytelling, we're in trouble.:::0:::None
With style and rubber to burn, this is a candidate for best movie of the year, even when it becomes too pleased with its own remorseless coolness -- with the action-painting blossoms of blood and the acousticophiliac squish of heel to face...:::1:::4/4
The extreme and escalating violence will prove off-putting to some-frankly, I'm surprised not to have been among them-but for the rest, Drive is a needle-punch of adrenaline to the aorta.:::1:::None
A movie with the title Drive should not be left in 'park.':::0:::2/5
In reworking genres without quoting shamelessly, Refn proves himself his own man and a guy quite capable of taking us places we didn't even know we wanted to go.:::1:::3.5/4
Drive is pedal-to-the-metal stuff. Don't get behind the wheel unless you can take the rush.:::1:::B+
While low-budget and uncompromising, Drive is energized by Refn's muscular direction. It kicks Bullitt-like butt even while it explores each character with a thoughtful eye, and allows us to understand each player in the street theatre that unfolds.:::1:::4/5
This is no antic-frantic affair; instead, it's a cerebral game of stop-and-go, hide-and-seek, as the director behind the camera handles things exactly like the guy behind the wheel - with a stylish mixture of cold calculation and cool aplomb.:::1:::3/4
A sublime piece of genre work.:::1:::4/5
The pace of this film is a beautiful thing to behold, as Drive is a patient but taut thriller.:::1:::A
It's refreshing to have a thriller that respects its audience's intelligence and rewards it with a theatrical experience that will stay with you for a long time.:::1:::4.5/5
Nicolas Winding Refn's pulse pounding film, 'Drive,' is met with stunning adoration. If you walked out of a theater and someone asked, "How was the film?", the word "cool" would take on a new meaning!:::1:::4/5
The end result just emanates coolness. If Drive was a high school student, it would hang out with the popular kids, date the prom queen and have a permanent seat in detention.:::1:::4.5/5
At times it is thrilling, while at other moments it is maddening. One thing, though, "Drive" is never dull.:::1:::2.5/4
A 'Bullitt' for a new generation, this is the film that will make a star out of Ryan Gosling for a conspicuously Steve McQueen-like turn as a young Los Angeles stunt car driver who moonlights as a 'wheelman' for thieves.:::1:::A minus
An enthralling piece of filmmaking in the same class as Martin Scorsese's "Taxi Driver," and Oscar-worthy acting that firmly places Gosling in the role of top-tier star.:::1:::4/4
...delivers enough action, suspense, and revenge to satisfy the multiplex masses while introducing them to the bleak, unsettling stillness and deconstructive black humor of Refn's overseas instincts.:::1:::B+
A stylish genre exercise...one might just as well say the L.A. story unfolds at the corner of Michael Mann and David Lynch.:::1:::3.5/4
The first fifteen minutes of Drive may be the best movie I've seen this year.:::1:::None
Some viewers will find the entire film pretentious to the extreme. And that view is completely fair. In fact, it may even be intended.:::1:::7/10
A modern day masterpiece. I wish I could go back and watch it for the first time all over again.:::1:::5/5
Refn has made a movie where the main characters barely speak and take themselves so seriously, that a little levity, at times, might have helped.:::0:::None
It's great: a minimalist, '80s-inspired Los-Angeles-loner-by-night dream of stoplights, headlights, moonlight, window glare, satin jackets and extremely cool knives.:::1:::4/5
Ryan Gosling is everywhere these days, and I couldn't be happier.:::1:::4.5/5
There were moments in 'Drive' that wrapped me up more fully than any movie I've seen in perhaps two or three years.:::1:::3.5/4
Drive is a brilliant piece of filmmaking, one of the very best of the year.:::1:::5/5
Drive is quite simply the best film that Michael Mann never made in the period where Thief, Manhunter and the scores of Giorgio Moroder and Tangerine Dream secreted off the screen and into our veins.:::1:::4/4
For stone-cold, retro action fans who are tired of all these over-edited, underachieving thrillers - well, here's one car chase movie that isn't running on empty.:::1:::3/4
Feels like some 1980's movie you'd find on cable TV after midnight, but director Nicholas Winding Refn knows how to class it up.:::1:::3.5/4
Anyone watching Drive won't be able to take their eyes off Gosling. Playing a Hollywood stunt driver who moonlights as a wheelman for criminals, he rocks like a young Steve McQueen or Robert De Niro.:::1:::3.5/4
Refn seems to be in control of every detail, starting with the niftily retro, hot-pink opening credits.:::1:::3.5/4
Gosling and director Nicolas Winding Refn neatly manage the hat trick of paying homage to those wheelmen of yore while reinvigorating the genre with style, smarts and flashes of wit.:::1:::4/4
It's fun, but the script, credited to Hossein Amini ("The Wings of the Dove"), is short on characterization and long on plot twists and wisecracks.:::1:::3/4
Every individual element of Drive is familiar, but the combination is uniquely intoxicating:::1:::A-
A triumph of mood and atmosphere, a film that leaves you in a sad, thoughtful reverie.:::1:::B+
These are not merely pulsing, pulpy action sequences; they are also illustrative extensions of a vibrant character study.:::1:::3.5/4
It is a volatile situation, and Refn plays that off the minimalist storyline, stripped-down dialog, retro electronic soundtrack, and cool compositions.:::1:::B+
In a year of near-perpetual ennui at the multiplex, "Drive," at long last, is a real, true, passionate motion picture to replenish a doubting cinema lover's soul.:::1:::4/4
It's a film in love with both traditional noir mythology and ultra-modern violence, a combination that is not ideal.:::0:::2/5
The look is artfully stylized, influenced by classic film noir; the mood is dark; the performances nuanced; and the story unnervingly exciting.:::1:::3.5/4
It's fascinating how the simple act of eliminating a lead character's back story can make a movie 100 percent better, at least in this case.:::1:::A
An amazing thriller, a modern examination of heroism filtered through the fairy tale culture of the underbelly of the movie machine that is easily one of the most memorable and effective films of not just this year but the last several.:::1:::5.0/5.0
As the film accrues intensity and awakes the demon lurking inside its protagonist, you can see it as something more than a retro-cool crime story. Rather, it's a parable of good and evil and the nature of man.:::1:::B+
Mainstream audiences will probably be confounded by "Drive," while lovers of gritty filmmaking will defend every exaggerated shotgun wound as art. Know which camp you're in before you enter the theater.:::1:::3/4
For all the movement in Drive, the quiet, deathly still moments are the ones that count.:::1:::4/5
Winding Refn shakes off the theatricality of his last film, Bronson, for a more intimate approach, and his actors are right there with him.:::1:::4/5
The first half of Drive unfolds like a romantic reverie.:::1:::B+
It's apparent from the opening credits that Drive is all about the unexpected.:::1:::3/4
Tasty, if sketchy, modern noir with car chases and bloody action that should turn the trick for genre-seeking audiences.:::1:::None
I can't remember the last time I felt so seduced by a film.:::1:::4/5
A throwback, but one with a stylish new spin...alternately solemn and explosive, it's a wild ride, though like any such enterprise more notable for excitement than emotional involvement.:::1:::B+
[Gosling] and this powerful film, which is ultimately about a moment of grace, deserve each other. He's the medium's most graceful minimalist.:::1:::None
To invest oneself emotionally in the central relationship, or the movie itself, would be akin to investing oneself emotionally in one's car. But when the car looks this good and drives this fast, why not?:::1:::None
"Drive" is somber, slick and earnest, and also a prisoner of its own emptiness, substituting moods for emotions and borrowed style for real audacity.:::0:::2.5/5
Excitingly ambitious. And whenever an untoward lull might seem to impend, Refn knows just when to hit the gas.:::1:::None
"Drive" is a fine and stylish, if ultraviolent, ride, filled with unexpectedly askew camera angles, nighttime lighting worthy of Raymond Chandler, and nuanced performances.:::1:::3/4
Slo-mo and the literal lyrical commentary from soundtrack selections wouldn't work in hands less sure than these, but Refn has created some kind of romantic macho masterpiece with "Drive"...:::1:::A-
Enters the viewer like a sharp unseen blade.:::1:::None
A shamelessly entertaining genre movie from director Nicolas Winding Refn that plays like an exalted episode of Miami Vice or a stealth version of Shane.:::1:::3/4
If deception is indeed an artform, then Drive is its Mona Lisa:::1:::4.5/5
A gripping crime thriller, aching romance and compelling character study made in an indelibly hypnotic style:::1:::5/5
There's a sleek, pulse-pounding, heart-racing machine in Drive, but it's buried deeply under an oppressive package of optional extras. For all of its good ideas -- and there are plenty of them -- the film eventually buckles under an excess of style.:::1:::None
"Drive" is being advertised as a fast, furious movie featuring flipped cars and exploding heads, but be forewarned - it's about 10 times more deliberate than your average Hollywood actioner.:::1:::B
Sometimes a movie knows you're watching it. It knows how to hold and keep you, how, when it's over, to make you want it all over again.:::1:::3.5/4
Drama requires emotions and cool requires their suppression. The tautly paced, peerlessly stylish crime drama "Drive" has it both ways.:::1:::4/4
As taut a film as you're likely to see in theaters this year. And it easily leaves other street-racing movies of its kind in the dust, even classics like "Vantage Point" and "Two-Lane Blacktop.":::1:::3.5/4
All right, first: everybody calm down. Drive is good, it's very good...but for me it lacks the emotional heft to elevate it from "gem" to "masterpiece.":::1:::B+
Gosling delivers a powerful performance in one of the most mesmerizing, unforgettable, and unique films of 2011.:::1:::A-
Refn favors long, quiet takes followed by intense, often horrifying outbursts; the movie has the same personality as the driver himself.:::1:::3/4
Though it easily surpasses most American action flicks, it suffers from the old commercial imperative of making the protagonist a nice guy, something Refn has seldom bothered with in Europe.:::0:::None
Something new and thrumming with life, a movie about detachment that has an intoxicating staying power.:::1:::4/5
The abrupt shifts between neo-noir fatalism and white-knight romanticism could give an unsuspecting viewer whiplash, but Refn has a trusty map and keeps his hands on the wheel.:::1:::3/4
Dangerously cool ... Style and acting this dazzling give a human pulse to the most savage behavior.:::1:::3.5/4
Drive is long on mood and sleek visuals, and the narrative seems merely a slender frame upon which to hang the director's highly stylized dressings. It's a tone poem set against the backdrop of a fairly standard crime-heist-gone-awry frame.:::1:::4/5
This genre film does what it does so well, and with such impressive directorial finesse, you won't mind stepping into the criminal muck and covering yourself in the blood and filth of some ice-cold thieves.:::1:::3.5/4
Before long, and then with grinding relish, "Drive" becomes one garishly sadistic set piece after another.:::0:::2.5/4
At a time when action films routinely pass off freneticness as excitement, Drive is a reminder of how powerful the genre can be when every shot and every line of dialogue has a purpose, deployed for maximum impact.:::1:::A
Here is still another illustration of the old Hollywood noir principle that a movie lives its life not through its hero, but within its shadows.:::1:::4/4
What ultimately makes Drive so compelling is its characters - sketches given dimension and heft by a superb cast.:::1:::3.5/4
...not the best film of 2011, but when all is said and done it will likely be the most alive.:::1:::3.5/4
The film can afford such narrative economy in part because Gosling is so effective, needing little in the way of words to convey the complexity of his character.:::1:::4/5
A beautifully dressed diet plate that nonetheless requires a man-sized proviso: That's still the brilliant Gosling onscreen, and that alone probably merits your money.:::1:::3/5
The most impressive performance here though comes from Albert Brooks who plays the deceptively friendly gangster and I will predict that he will get his first Oscar nomination (and possible win) in over twenty years.:::1:::B
Drive revels in sensory detail; it's a visually and aurally edgy Euro-influenced American genre movie about the coolness of noir-influenced American genre movies about the coolness of driving - especially in L.A.:::1:::B+
Think of "Drive" as the cinematic equivalent of riding in a car that projects a fashionably stylish image. Sure, the gas mileage may be terrible and the engine unreliable, but it's such a smooth, good-looking ride that you'll put up with the annoyances.:::1:::4/5
An ideal role for Gosling, who's always better seen than heard, contributing a near-wordless performance of pure style and stare, posed carefully while Refn fans the Steve McQueen flames...A sensational picture.:::1:::A
Pulsating...very cool. Could have used a little more "driving," though.:::1:::3/4
Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn's coolly beautiful action thriller looks like a slick, Hollywood thrill ride, but it's actually a bleakly funny deconstruction of genre movie cliches that will delight some viewers and infuriate others.:::1:::None
Gosling's amazing, subtle performance - body language, a glance of his eyes - turns this psychologically charged action movie into more than a genre piece.:::1:::None
Drive feels like some kind of masterpiece -- it's as pure a version of the essentials as you're likely to see.:::1:::5/5
Gosling's masculine, minimalist approach makes him mysteriously compelling. Yes, there's the fact that he's gorgeous. But he also does so much with just a subtle glance, by just holding a moment a beat or two longer than you might expect.:::1:::3/4
It is with the utmost respect I compare Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive to some of the seminal movies of the 1970's...because Drive is as heartpoundingly good as it is slim, stark and hard to shake.:::1:::None
Nicolas Winding Refn's sleek heist flick offers more quiet moments than you'd expect with a title like Drive. And some that aren't so quiet.:::1:::3.5/4
The film... has a kind of daredevil control, swerving dangerously close to and abruptly away from self-parody.:::1:::None
This remake could have audiences tapping their feet... as they wait for it to end.:::0:::2.5/5
FEMA can take a day off because Footloose is one remake that won't be called a natural disaster, in fact, it's one hell of a good film.:::1:::8/10
Director Craig Brewer has Southernized the story...made it lighter on its feet.:::1:::2.5/4
It's unlikely that Brewer's Footloose will persuade many remake skeptics but the film does deliver surprisingly enjoyable character drama and exciting choreography.:::1:::3/5
I can easily imagine this FOOTLOOSE being looked back on down the road as the film that launched these names much like how the '84 film is reflected on in terms of Bacon.:::1:::3/4
You either go all the way with it or simply roll your eyes when confronted by its terrible, cynical crassness.:::0:::None
I'm sure there was some great choreography and some great dancing that went into this movie. You don't see any of it.:::0:::None
It's taken me a long time to come to grips with this cinematic weakness - or maybe it's a blessing. I like dance movies, especially if the music is bouncy and it makes the characters happy. That's an infectious film sequence for me.:::1:::3/4
It's as if the filmmakers decided, 'We're sticking with the basic script, but this ain't your mama's 'Footloose.':::0:::B-
The latest Footloose is a step up from recent dance flicks.:::1:::3/5
The characters, the scenes, the dancing, even much of the dialogue are all plugged into a rigidly prefabricated storyline that treats its 1984 predecessor more as holy writ instead of perishable Reagan-era cheese.:::1:::2.5/5
It seems torn by a desire to appeal to every contemporary teenager's rebellious side, but remains too scared to cut loose from the things that made the original appeal to their parents.:::0:::1/5
An unnecessary, though enjoyable, remake of Kevin Bacon's 1984 breakout hit.:::1:::None
The makers of 'Footloose 2.0' can be faulted for actually sticking too closely to the original.:::1:::3/5
While the 2011 version of the film doesn't suck, it isn't as good as the original ...:::1:::2.5/4
Better than I thought it would be, but not as good as I hoped it would be.:::1:::6/10
...the film's overlength ultimately prevent[s] it from becoming the propulsive piece of work Brewer has clearly intended.:::1:::2.5/4
The dancing sequences are terrific - even the line-dancing is tolerable - but what really sells this quality reboot are the dashes of reality missing from the original.:::1:::3/5
If you haven't seen the original and are happy to ignore some of the more mad script decisions, you might get a kick out of it, but otherwise, youre better off re-watching the movie that started it all.:::0:::2.5/5
'I believe that any town where Dennis Quaid can wear pleated trousers should also be a town where kids can dance,' says Ren. 'But first, I will prove my bona fides by racing a school bus encrusted with stuffed animals!':::0:::D
It's a rare remake that improves on the original. But the new Footloose does just that. The dancing is better, the drama grittier, the stars sexier -- and the music and the cast are more energetic and diverse.:::1:::None
The most immaterial remake of 2011, and boy, ain't that saying something.:::0:::4/10
Brewer can ... stage and shoot a dance sequence in a way that the movement can be wholly appreciated, and those scenes become infectiously entertaining.:::1:::3/4
An almost risibly old-fashioned crowd-pleaser...weirdly constrained by Brewer's determination to ape the original so earnestly...so clean-cut and wholesome that the MTV imprimatur attached to it seems like a joke.:::0:::C
This is an unimaginative, near-carbon copy of what everyone recognised in 1984 as a cross between Flashdance and Rebel Without a Cause.:::0:::None
I'm sure there are plenty of people who will say that the original version was so much better than this one and they may be right, but I'm certainly in no hurry to prove it.:::0:::2/4
With his delightful learning-how-to-dance sequence, Miles Teller almost steals 'Footloose' from fantastic dancers Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough.:::1:::None
Footloose is completely harmless, and quite enjoyable at times. Like any good pop song, it's got a beat, and you can dance to it.:::1:::3/5
Utterly unnecessary, ham-fisted remake of a supposed 1980s "classic.":::0:::None
It seems more pandering (and dated) than ever.:::0:::C
I was not impressed by the original and was pleased to find a slight satisfaction in the refreshed model.:::1:::3/5
Footloose is fancy-free, an iconic movie's tribute that could stand on its own two, tapping feet.:::1:::B+
"Footloose" has the look and feel of an OK basic cable movie.":::0:::2/5
In terms of empty-headed exuberance, it's hard to top Footloose.:::1:::B-
There was really no reason to remake it, but if you accept the fact that remakes are inevitable in today's Hollywood, then the new Footloose shows at least how to avoid travesty.:::1:::None
This is a situation where audiences will go into the theater humming the featured songs, and while the movie they see offers no surprises, it does something relatively few fall releases can claim: it delivers exactly what it promises...:::1:::None
'You deal with your pain in extremes,' the minister is told. The line is a key to Brewer's filmography: All the director's movies are about people who deal with their pain in extremes, and the plots chronicle the consequences of their coping...:::1:::3.5/4
Sure, it sings a familiar tune. But it's got a good beat, and you can dance to it.:::1:::3/5
Tweaking the story just a little, the new film brings things up to date while including a few nostalgic salutes to the original - including Ren's bright-yellow VW Beetle and Ariel's red-leather cowboy boots.:::1:::3/5
Remake is surprisingly fresh but still faithful to original.:::1:::3/5
This remake plays like the high school version of a big Broadway stage show. Although that's probably unfair to high school theater.:::0:::1.5/4
Footloose is kind of like eating imitation crab. The taste is there, but it's just not quite right.:::0:::3/5
The movie brings out some touching and heartfelt emotions. You won't be able to resist bobbing your head and tapping your toes. The 113-minute running time passes by quickly as you become totally absorbed in this crowd-pleasing musical extravaganza.:::1:::3/4
'Footloose' remake is almost paradise.:::1:::B
If Footloose had to be remade, this is probably the best version we were likely to get.:::1:::None
While the story is more oddly archaic than ever, we might find ourselves exiting the movie with the overwhelming desire to kick off our own Sunday shoes.:::1:::6/10
The good-looking, athletic cast kick up their heels with gusto and choreographer Jamal Sims melds line dancing with hip hop and street, always harking back affectionately to the iconic moments of the earlier version.:::1:::None
May not make as great a dent in the current generation as the original film had, but it does offer up a commendable amount of energy and heart...:::1:::None
it's a decent offer notwithstanding the fact that it's an unnecessary remake hoping to cash in on the reputation of its earlier incarnation. (Movie Review for Parents also available):::1:::None
A film that's corny, predictable and disposable. But it's also pretty good fun - after you've had a few.:::1:::3/5
Paramount's Footloose reboot never quite cuts loose enough to distinguish itself from the original.:::0:::None
A cheerful if slightly vacuous entertainment, with some intrepid dancing to keep audiences on their toes.:::1:::3/5
By the time four little girls teach a dorky guy to dance to (the original) "Let's Hear It for the Boy" I was a gelatinous blob of pure affection. Bring on "Flashdance" 2.0.:::1:::3/4
Brewer has delivered a largely unobjectionable note-for-note facsimile of Herbert Ross's ode to teenage rebellion, young love and the unfettered joy of movement.:::1:::2.5/4
This new version will quite capably supply the same amount of carefree fun to a new generation. Which is exactly what a clever, if not particularly ambitious, remake sets out to do.:::1:::3/4
I never want to dance again.:::0:::D
Barely fresh considering director Craig Brewer essentially made a carbon copy of the original film just with less chemistry and a leading actor who sounded like Mark Whalberg!:::1:::3/5
Brewer makes good use of the songs from the 1984 film that work, and while the film is too long, dragging out the drama, it's got a real pulse.:::1:::B
You can't really ask much more from something you didn't ask to exist in the first place. I'm not here to tell you to give in or just go with it. But if you do, you'll leave smiling. Sometimes the machine spits out something good.:::1:::4/5
It's the single most harmless teen movie in the recent cinematic landscape, and also one of the most charmingly fun.:::1:::3.5/5
The patent absurdity would be forgotten or at least forgiven if the songs and the moves were any good, but aside from the title track it's a sorry farrago of blandness.:::0:::2/5
A real drag from beginning to end.:::0:::1/5
Footloose drags its heels to the senior prom and, when it finally gets there, shoves in one last punch-up that puts an odd spin on what should be an upbeat display of happy feet.:::0:::2/4
You got to turn me around and put my feet on the ground, so I can walk out as quickly as possible.:::0:::1/4
Following the script of the original as if it were an Arthur Murray dance diagram, Brewer's do-over is at its root a very capable display of painting by numbers.:::0:::2.5/4
A dumbed-down, sexed-up take on a story that was already risque and not too bright &#8230; softens the '84 film's critique of the church, but is also further from its lingering Christian worldview.:::0:::2/4
Whether you prefer the original or the remake will be a matter of taste.:::1:::3/5
There's at least one very compelling reason to see it: Brewer understands how to do music on film better than anyone else working today.:::1:::B-
Every dance sequence in the film is simply spectacular.:::1:::None
The most important thing this version has in common with the original is that the talking parts are too long and the dancing parts are too short.:::1:::B+
While it doesn't excuse Hollywood and their tendency to prefer the established property over a new idea, at least they're getting better at making the reboots watchable.:::1:::3.5/5
Works as a breezy entertainment that audiences will want to flock to on a Friday night.:::1:::2.5/4
Sweet, shamelessly cheesy and surprisingly wholesome.:::1:::None
"Footloose" is still too long and too square to jump up and down about. But it offers a mild diversion for those who still believe "the music is on his side.":::1:::2.5/4
Give credit to Craig Brewer, the filmmaker behind the new Footloose, for realizing a new step was in order.:::1:::B+
All in all, this is a film I attended with rock-bottom expectations, and came out of feeling elated.:::1:::4/5
This guilty-pleasure update has an angsty adolescent energy that's as infectious as anything in Contagion.:::1:::B
A new Footloose with sassier steps and the same contrived story is hardly necessary.:::0:::2/4
Solidly entertaining and, dare I say, toe tapping fun!":::1:::4/5
Stays remarkably close to its predecessor in all the ways that count.:::1:::3/5
It's a vibrant youth musical that will appeal to audiences who haven't seen the 1984 original. And it has enough charm and life to it to compete with the memory of the earlier version.:::1:::3/4
The film's sheer exuberance is frequently enough to overcome its regular moments of dull writing, dubious logic, and cliched plotting and acting.:::1:::B-
The idea of an American town outlawing dancing was a stretch back in 1984, but in the intervening years, it's actually become more believable - which goes some way to justifying this remake.:::1:::3/5
Footloose 2011 is harmless as far as it goes, but on the dance floor and off it never goes nearly far enough.:::0:::2/4
The film's best asset is Miles Teller, so good as the guilty teenager of "Rabbit Hole," as the lead's instant best buddy.:::1:::C+
a pretty good remake of Footloose: good-hearted, sincere, enjoyable, not too stupid:::0:::3/5
Maybe there is something timeless in anachronism. Maybe Brewer has located the heart beneath the hoke.:::1:::None
As in most movies of this ilk, the drama is stuff you sit through to get to the good parts, which are the zippy music and athletic dancing. And they are very good.:::1:::3/4
It's an eruption of joyous, jitterbugging energy and a polished piece of filmmaking.:::1:::3.5/4
Some things never change: The best part of "Footloose" is the dancing.:::1:::B-
Every now and then, we need to be reminded that shaking your booty is something essential. Or, in the case of director Craig Brewer's Footloose update, shaking your rebooty.:::1:::2.5/4
It's as if Brewer is taking a stand for movies that look like movies instead of audience hipness barometers.:::1:::9/10
Wormald lacks Bacon's charisma but Hough has an undeniable star quality, and Teller is a comic delight.:::1:::3/5
Surprisingly enjoyable. Please don't remake Flashdance, though.:::1:::3/5
A boisterous, almost scene-for-scene remake of the 1984 jukebox-musical-dance hit.:::1:::2.5/4
Once you've seen the remake of Footloose, it really doesn't seem like such a bad idea.:::1:::3/5
Brewer has a firm command of the material and a great sense of how to film dance sequences. Can't wait to see what this filmmaker does next.:::1:::3/5
Clearly, Brewer has come to praise Footloose, not to bury it, and so he leaves Dean Pitchford's screenplay more or less intact. The result is one of the more pleasant surprises of 2011.:::1:::None
Sells the concept's inherent silliness with enough lighthearted charm and earnestness to match the surprisingly enduring original.:::1:::3.5/5
The movie plays like a slightly degraded version of the original: the dialogue is a little lamer, the acting a little poorer.:::0:::None
Don't hate Footloose because it's a remake. The dance-movie-love-story-freedom-of-expression thumper is a rollicking good time.:::1:::B+
Somehow "Footloose" never finds its rhythm. The maudlin scenes drag on, and the livelier moments pass by too quickly.:::0:::2.5/5
Finds a victorious sense of pride in dancing your ass off--good clean rebellion if there ever was some.:::1:::3/4
If you can leave your cynicism at the door then this is top-quality Saturday night popcorn entertainment.:::1:::4/5
"Footloose" poses as a bold update, but it's shockingly out of step with the times.:::0:::2/4
It's pretty much the same movie, minus some of the more egregious '80s fashions.:::0:::2.5/4
Whatever limitations the movie has are part of its charm.:::1:::2.5/4
When a film depends on feeling something between the photogenic but antiseptic Wormald and Hough, and you don't, you realize why that film may come up short in ways unrelated to dance training.:::0:::2/4
Brewer's hot-and-bothered remake uncorks the original's raging libido, and it's as seamy and sordid as that damnable PG-13 rating will allow.:::1:::B-
This 2011 version is so similar - sometimes song for song and line for line - that I was wickedly tempted to reprint my 1984 review, word for word.:::0:::1.5/4
None of the changes improves on the original Footloose, even though the two young leads are both professional dancers - didn't the budget allow for anything more than raft swinging and barn hoofing?:::0:::2/4
There is good humour throughout.:::1:::3/5
While there's definite energy in the dance sequences, the hokum outweighs the exuberance.:::0:::2.5/5
What results is something stylish, modern, nostalgic, cheesy, and more than a little Frankensteinian.:::1:::2.5/4
I don't know what Brewer wanted to capture. There are too many close-ups of stomping, swinging feet to suggest he cared about great choreography.:::0:::2.5/4
A pleasant reminder of the past for fans of the first one, and an agreeable-enough experience for everyone else.:::1:::3/5
Craig Brewer's adaptation cleverly gives several nods and winks to the first film, but also has a modern sensibility that every teenager today will understand.:::1:::3.5/5
Wormald and Hough don't look or dance like adolescents letting off steam; their professionalism overwhelms what should be a simple pleasure. The film sometimes has the same problem.:::0:::2.5/5
As far as acting goes, these kids certainly can dance.:::0:::2/4
In most regards (We still miss Kevin Bacon), this is a "new and improved" "Footloose," funnier, sunnier and funkier. Simply put, it works.:::1:::2.5/4
It may not be great art, but it sure as hell knows how to dance.:::1:::8/10
Entertaining, sporadically delightful, but like most reheats, it lacks the essential sense of surprise found in the original picture.:::1:::B-
Brewer adds a gritty texture and shows ingenuity in the ways he inserts tunes from the original. But the basic material is at best a guilty pleasure.:::0:::None
This updated version of the 27-year-old Footloose is competently made and lively enough.:::1:::3/5
Updating the quarter-of-a-century old original with a more racially representative cast and hipper street moves, Brewer also trumps his predecessor with a zinging script and some likeable performances...:::1:::3/5
Hugely entertaining, remake that's obviously been made with a healthy love of the original film and succeeds thanks to a faithful script, terrific dance sequences and strong performances from its cast.:::1:::3/5
Wormald and Hough are both handsome and good on the dance floor, but they come across more like teen stars in training than representations of real youth angst.:::0:::2/4
It's startling how badly the dance numbers and action sequences are staged, shot and cut.:::0:::None
Star-crossed lovers Wormald and Julianne Hough can't match Bacon and Lori Singer, but over-30s will tap feet and the Glee crowd will mime along.:::1:::3/5
A virtual cinematic poison pill to anyone irrevocably divorced from any trace memories of adolescent feeling, and further proof that in life but especially art feeling is stronger than thought.:::1:::3/5
The plot may be straightforward but it's refreshing to see a modern dance film that tackles religion, convention and local law alongside the requisite forbidden romance.:::1:::3/5
This Footloose takes place in the same authentic, sweaty, lived-in South as his Hustle & Flow and Black Snake Moan.:::1:::3/5
While it's true that few viewers will venture into a theater showing this remake for the story, the screenplay should not be a detriment to enjoyment. Less talking and more dancing would have made for a more footloose and fancy-free environment.:::0:::2.5/4
While hewing closely to Footloose's original story and themes, Brewer's film throws the standard high school movie notion of a teenage caste system out the window.:::1:::None
Brewer puts just enough smarts, sweat and swagger into his version of the dance steps making up this film that you can't help but move your feet and hum along.:::1:::3/5
Like the original, it's a bogus melodrama built around ersatz popular music..a tribute to cinematic contrivance, a product instead of an expression of anything remotely real.:::0:::None
Predictable plot, solid music and dancing.:::1:::B
After his sophomore jinx, Brewer is back on firm ground with this retro (but not cool), old-fashioned musical remake, which you can see with your parents and grandparents due to its unabashedly corny and harmless nature.:::1:::B-
There have been far, far worse remakes out there. Harmless, feel-good fun.:::1:::3/5
It feels like a film walking in the shoes of its predecessor with a slightly sassier spring in its step. But at a certain point in the final act, this remake seems to forget why we're all watching.:::0:::None
Is there any thing lamer than rebelling exactly the same way that your parents did? ... This is not to elevate the original Footloose beyond its modest, corny self, but the remake feels pointedly useless.:::0:::D
A lively and rambunctious remake of the 1984 classic about a rebel with a cause who loves to dance.:::1:::4/5
This remake rocks with toe-tapping adolescent angst.:::1:::7/10
Ren now dances with his iPod, the black kids krump in the carpark and the grown-ups worry about the recession. And that's about where the updating ends.:::1:::3/5
Nicely produced, but the converted are more likely to be impressed than the skeptical.:::0:::2/4
Dares to preach its highly controversial message in order to inspire the faithful while risking the ire of critics and non-believers. Its message? Fathers, man up.:::1:::B+
Despite violence, Christian fatherhood drama is uplifting.:::1:::3/5
Yeah, it's still a preach-to-the-choir movie, but this choir doesn't really see itself on the big screen very often, so don't begrudge them a film where the action hero cop stops and prays for guidance before big gun battle. It happens.:::0:::2/5
Sadly, this particular Gospel is not very good.:::0:::2/5
It takes a certain touch to pull it off, and here, the serviceable cast just doesn't have it in them.:::0:::2/4
The many topics raised - gangs, drugs, immigration, absentee parents, poverty - are examined with didacticism and platitudes instead of by mining their inherent complexities.:::0:::2/5
Overplotted and understructured, "Courageous" is a slog to get through at 130 minutes.:::0:::2.5/5
Devolves into over-the-top drama and a suffocating heavy-handedness.:::0:::C
Fails to answer the more pressing question of why religious sagas such as this treat subtlety as a sin.:::0:::None
Courageous literally preaches to the converted, delivering ham-fisted messages of responsibility to the most receptive audience possible.:::0:::D+
Profound without being preachy, "Courageous" never forgets to entertain:::1:::8/10
It has some occasional rough acting, is too episodic for its own good, and could have been trimmed by a good 30 minutes. Even so, it's the group's most accomplished offering to date and that's saying something. (Movie Review for Parents also available):::1:::None
The performances are effective all around with director Kendrick quite moving in the central role of Adam, the veteran officer, who suffers a horrific family tragedy that sets much of the film's plot in motion.:::1:::None
Praise be to Courageous for being upfront.:::0:::2/4
A valiant effort, but Courageous is such a clumsy motion picture, incapable of delivering its critical messages without displaying some of the most cringe-inducing filmmaking of the year.:::0:::D+
If you have a tendency to nod off during sermons, Courageous has a cure for that -- a noisy last act gun-battle with drug dealers that's primetime ready.:::0:::2.5/5
While the film's church-based roots and the tendency toward didactic, schematic storytelling are still in evidence, Courageous is [Sherwood's] most ambitious and watchable film to date.:::1:::2.5/4
Like a pastor so caught up in the moment that he can't see that the air conditioning has given out and the congregation wants to go home, the film travels far beyond its dramatic climax, aiming for an altar call finale.:::0:::1.5/4

not terrible, but not great:::1:::3/5
It's like an amusement park ride operating in the middle of a rave in which The Chemical Brothers provide a no-one-gets-out-alive thrust of unimpeded propulsion.:::1:::A-
Jason Bourne meets Run Lola Run in a movie that brings terrifying new meaning to 'child abuse'.:::1:::3.5/5
"A furious neck-snapping thriller that summons up memories of a dozen other movies and manages to improve on most of them.":::1:::3.5/4
Teenage assassin trained as a killing machine since birth? Unless your movie has Nicolas Cage dressed like Batman with a paedo-tache, you're fighting a losing battle from the start.:::1:::3/5
For a film that is supposed to be a thriller, the thrills are few and far in between. What "Hanna" really ends up being is a missed opportunity.:::0:::2/4
Having already long proven her acting chops, Ronan shows a bright future as a bona fide movie star.:::1:::3/4
While the plot has some minor flaws, the incredible performances, characters, soundtrack and action beats of Hanna more than make up for it.:::1:::8/10
The ingredients are there for success, but as we build toward resolution (or even increased conflict) Hanna fails to develop at a rate to match the sum of its parts.:::1:::2/4
Sometimes a gritty, unpolished, and decidedly European-style thriller is exactly what you're looking for.:::1:::3.0/4.0
As a thriller, this strange, at times hypnotic, fable about a damaged little girl severely disappoints.:::0:::3/5
A sour, empty graphic novel of an escapade from the man who once helmed 'Atonement,' 'Hanna' gets intensely more godawful as it approaches its climax.:::0:::None
'Hanna,' 'Salt' and 'Colombiana' should all merge together for a sequel.:::0:::C+
[Joe] Wright is a natural successor to the late Anthony Minghella, able to deftly mix visual panache with small-scale emotion.:::1:::4/5
This cool, calculated who's-hunting-who piece brings home all the requisite tension, gunplay and fighting with a great deal of cinematic style.:::1:::3.5/5
Joe Wright leaves behind everything he has previously done. He seems hardened and full of fury, perhaps a response at the unfair way his The Soloist (2009) was received. Hanna is stripped-down, fast, and fantastic.:::1:::None
...most of the time Wright simply throws everything he can think of at the screen like the promo director he used to be. Great soundtrack, though.:::0:::2/5
A flashy but disposable exercise in style over substance... [Blu-ray]:::0:::2/4
Hanna is a perfect example of visual filmmaking elevating a substandard story.:::1:::3.5/5
A kinetic action thriller of high quality, Hanna is as visually strong as it is emotionally engrossing, thanks to strong central performances and a welcome change of pace from director Joe Wright.:::1:::4/5
The entire thing - the whole weight of the movie - rests on the remarkable abilities of Saoirse Ronan ... she's an exceptional actor. She's one of a kind.:::1:::4/5
Wright is capable of much better, as is everyone in the cast. He's trying to make a silky Euro thriller with a frisson of controversy. It's more like a never-ending trailer.:::0:::2.5/5
While you enjoy much of where Hanna is taking you, the destination is both bewildering and frustrating and, in retrospect, the path taken is extremely brutal.:::1:::3/5
While the performances are all strong, the real star here is Joe Wright's inspired direction, which transforms this action thriller into a modern fairytale.:::1:::None
Hanna is an intriguing action-thriller that's best described as a cross between Run Lola Run and The Bourne Identity.:::1:::B
The filmmakers struggle to satisfactorily connect the core driver of the story, a half hearted attempt at a sci fi element, into the plot, which leaves the film unable to articulate what it is that it wants to say:::0:::None
A top notch thriller, laced with suspense, action and a wonderful sense of mystery:::1:::None
An extraordinarily visceral and subjective film, brilliantly straddling the divide between art-house and action cinema.:::1:::4/5
The adrenalin rush is fun, but neglecting the character dynamics means that, when the lights go up, Hanna will just be a fleeting memory.:::1:::3/5
Like a lover who brags about his prowess in bed but cannot deliver when the moment comes, the climax is overlong, tedious and deeply disappointing.:::0:::5/10
Funky, random and well shot, this action film about a girl (excellent Saoirse Ronan) trained to be an assassin gets a little overly-stylized and illogical for its own good.:::0:::B-
Folklore undercurrents that prove initially spry and intriguing are soon rendered ... leadenly obvious.:::0:::C+
It's probably not enough for a movie to look and sound nice when it comes at the expense of character, story and basic logic, but it really does look and sound nice.:::1:::None
I loved it. For the entire film, I was captivated by the opposing forces of business versus pleasure in Hanna's life.:::1:::4/5
A fast-paced action thriller where standard operating procedure doesn't seem to apply.:::1:::4/5
Wright proves himself a skilled action director, handling the kinetic requirements of the admittedly fairly routine material with a deft hand, aided entirely by solid performances and a killer soundtrack from The Chemical Brothers.:::1:::3/5
Cate Blanchett's ruthless CIA operative, a woman so driven she even makes flossing look scary.:::1:::None
It's an action movie with brainy aspirations, but director Joe Wright is too literal and broad for the arthouse crowd.:::1:::3/5
The larger-than-life characters, the jarring colour schemes and, especially, the Chemical Brothers' erratic, block-rocking score reflect the world as its protagonist experiences it: beautiful, violent, loud and frequently bizarre.:::1:::4/5
The body count is phenomenal and the overall effect polished, weightless and unmemorable.:::0:::None
Despite having unlimited potential, Hanna doesn't reach the heights of the best in class like Inception, The Fugitive and the Bourne series.:::1:::4/5
Hanna sits between two audiences - arthouse and multiplex - and will disappoint both.:::0:::None
Hanna really is good enough to justify comparisons with similar breathless chase films like Leon and the Bourne series.:::1:::4/5
There's little doubt that Wright has made a technically proficient and often imaginative film, attempting to be an action movie with a mind of its own, referencing fairy tales, reality and super-duper spectacle.:::1:::3/5
Wright has created an adrenaline-fuelled, modern-day fairytale that you will want to see again Hanna-gain.:::1:::4/5
Can this really be a Joe Wright film? Where are the corsets and crinoline?:::1:::4/5
Wright paces his action scenes well, and cinematographer Alwin Kuchler captures every scene as if he painted it himself. A mixed bag of genres, Hanna delivers on them all.:::1:::3.5/5
Fun in places but unfulfilling as a whole.:::0:::2/5
After a strongish start, the film doesn't so much sag as utterly collapse - each audience member will feel like someone who has flung himself into a hammock that isn't tied at either end.:::0:::2/5
The cast is strong enough to keep us engaged even when the plot skips over some glaring implausibilities:::1:::3.5/5
Succeeds in blending the strange, almost fairy-tale atmosphere with some expertly conceived action and unusual, well-sketched supporting characters...:::1:::4/5
Ronan has developed into quite a force to be reckoned with, and proves such a strong and hypnotic lead that she almost outshines her older co-stars, Bana and Blanchett.:::1:::4/5
Like all Wright movies, it's stylishly shot in some interesting locations. It's certainly not a bad film, I just wish it was tauter.:::1:::3/5
A surreal thriller needs a thrillmaker with a gift for the surreal, not the pedestrian talent (here) of Joe Wright.:::0:::1/5
Hanna's not always on target, but you shouldn't take your eyes off her.:::1:::3/5
Pacey, excitingly directed mini-Bourne-style thriller with a strong script, superb action sequences, a great soundtrack and a terrific central performance from Saoirse Ronan.:::1:::4/5
... the kind of deliberately stylish espionage yarn that Ingmar Bergman and Orson Welles might have agree upon, had they been predisposed to such foolishness.:::1:::2.5/4
While the film as a whole may be episodic and wayward, and not always in a good way, the action scenes are uniformly sharp, inventive and gripping.:::1:::4/5
Wright makes sure his story looks great... but it's an empty experience, a Frankenstein story with no heft, indeed with little apparent awareness of the classic tale it is evolved from..:::0:::None
An absurd-sounding concept rendered wholly believable and thrilling by a fearless young actress and a director at the top of his game.:::1:::4/5
It doesn't engage with the morality of the situation she's in, but it provides the audience with a kind of a dark fairy-tale perspective of what the outside world must look like through the eyes of a teenage girl who has never seen it before.:::1:::3/4
Complex puzzle pieces fit together to make an overly simple and familiar picture. It only seems complex because Wright does not play fairly with the viewer.:::1:::6/10
This film channels the haunting fantasy of the Brothers Grimm, with the hazy, colourful power of Lolita, and the thumping action of a Bourne film.:::1:::4/5
Along with makeup and sisterly advice, the regular teenager Sophie provides the trained killer Hanna with a glimpse of what she's missed.:::0:::None
The movie feels alive in a thrilling way, sometimes even a funny way, even when its thrills are cheap, confused, or diaphanous.:::1:::B
"I just missed your heart," Hanna says at one point, as she spears an enemy to death. Not mine, she didn't.:::1:::5/5
The Plausibility Alarm went off somewhere in the film's first scene, and then the thing rang so many times that it finally broke.:::1:::None
Can't be accused of visual dullness, but shouldn't it make a little more sense?:::0:::None
If the trajectory of Atonement director Joe Wright's career went a little off course with his last film, touchy-feely US debut The Soloist, it's now firmly back on track with Hanna.:::1:::4/5
An entertainingly nutty action thriller from the director Joe Wright.:::1:::None
For better or worse, it's impossible to pin Hanna down:::0:::2.5/4
Includes a pulsating soundtrack by The Chemical Brothers and tremendous fight and chase choreography that will absolutely, leave you on the edge of your seat.:::1:::4.5/5
With much more to it than its teenage assassin plot, Hanna is a grim fairy tale about a girl's coming-of-age that's also terribly entertaining. Thrilling to both the eye and ear, Hanna stands apart as a cerebral action movie.:::1:::4.5/5
Wright puts a compelling spin on the conventional action thriller by imbuing the violence with an underlying sense of sadness and pathos.:::1:::3.5/4
An ultra-modern, uber-cool original action adventure infused with elements from fairy tales and video games and choreographed to a thumping Chemical Brothers soundtrack.:::1:::None
It's an adrenalin rush to watch this dynamo spontaneously deal with all the brutal thugs who are given no time to think about their wrong presumptions. For action fans, it's paydirt.:::1:::4/5
If Hanna is all surfaces, [director] Wright at least has the basic decency to make sure the surfaces gleam.:::1:::7/10
If you have a strong personal sense of morality, or if you value human life, you will probably find this a disappointing film.:::0:::C
Provides the thrills of a well-made action picture, but with the potential for being much more squandered.:::1:::2.5/4
Her gentle name is deceiving. 'Hanna' is a cold-blooded killer. Saoirse Ronan plays a teenager who isn't the kind of girl you want to upset in this action-packed thriller that's sort of a juvenile version of 'Run Lola Run.':::1:::3.5/4
To me the film just didn't fit together. It doesn't really come together to make an action film.:::0:::None
Exactly what you might expect with the director of Atonement let loose on an action picture. That's both the good news and the bad news.:::1:::4/5
It tries to be everything to all people, with its young star (to attract to tweenies), copious mayhem (startling at times) and hard-boiled characters but only succeeds in part.:::1:::B
Wright never met a flashy edit or swirling camera move he didn't like.:::0:::C+

Ronan is prefect for the title role but Joe Wright's directing is a little sluggish. And where did Blanchett get that accent?:::0:::5/10
...a well-paced, entertaining adventure...If you can put up with (the violence) this is a highly entertaining film.:::1:::8/10
When the beats and the color saturation fades, we're left with nothing but a very surface, very uninteresting story.:::0:::C+
An effective thriller with a terrific lead performance by Saoirse Ronan and an excellent sound design.:::1:::3.5/4
Not too many surprises here, just a great action flick with a sci-fi edge.:::1:::8/10
Blessed with considerable virtues, including a clever concept, crackling filmmaking and a charismatic star, it ultimately squanders all of them, undone by an unfortunate lack of subtlety and restraint.:::0:::2.5/5
What keeps us hooked is Ronan, a young actress of seemingly limitless abilities, and the tension she creates between Hanna's inhumanly agile body and quizzical eyes, which turn cold only when she pulls the trigger.:::1:::None
Artfully photographed and cleverly themed, the simple story is elevated by director Joe Wright who combines elements of a James Bond adventure thriller, and an innocent coming-of-age story, framing it all within the structure of a fairy tale.:::1:::4/5
Action-packed, this is a humorless pursuit thriller with an enticing impact.:::1:::7/10
Though shooting to be an art film, it never rises above being a moderately diverting escapist action film.:::0:::C+
This is a fairy tale. If you go into this expecting...Judy Blume's Bourne Identity or something, you'll be disappointed.:::1:::4/5
A chase flick that on balance is worth catching.:::1:::2.5/4
This film is bound to give the home-schooling movement a bad name, unless, of course, you're running a home school for assassins.:::1:::B
This guilty pleasure is by far the coolest movie of the year with cross-generational appeal to fans of espionage thrillers.:::1:::3/4
So loosely plotted as to be laughable, this adrenalized fairy tale has the high-gloss sheen of a Bourne flick, but none of the smarts. Consider yourself warned: The more you dwell on Hanna's story, the less there is to enjoy.:::1:::C+
Action cinema for audiences who crave something deeper than what you typically get.:::1:::3.5/4
In Hanna, Joe Wright demonstrates a savant-like mastery of visual film language with a mercenary skill focused on making you feel exactly what he wants. Even when the script itself might not be up to the task.:::1:::7.2/10
Watching Hanna is like watching someone else play a really expensive video game...:::0:::4/10
Does in 15 minutes what Sucker Punch couldn't do in 110.:::1:::4/5
"Hanna" plays out as a visceral fairy tale about a naif discovering a world both fascinating and dangerous.:::1:::3/4
HANNA is the sort of movie that gives you faith in action films as not just ass-kicking or fun rides but as actual cinema:::1:::None
Saoirse Ronan is a talented young actress who tends to be better than the movies she's in. And that tendency holds true with "Hanna," an unsteady thriller that staggers when it should sprint.:::0:::C
Hanna opens with a bang and sustains both its extraordinary energy and its central enigma for quite a while. If, ultimately, there is a little bit less here than meets the eye...:::1:::None
I gave up trying to keep track of the plot and wondered, Just what the hell is going on here?:::0:::2/4
Hanna is far from perfect but, courtesy of star Saoirse Ronan and director Joe Wright, it's one of those imperfect pictures that manages to command and hold our attention straight from the opening frames.:::1:::3/4
This thriller about a teen assassin packs plenty of visual style, but the story rings surprisingly hollow.:::0:::2/4
Wright delivers an electric mash up of genres and styles, a kind of action fairy tale in which the princess is a highly trained killer, the wicked stepmother is a ruthless government agent, and there is no handsome prince or happy ending.:::1:::None
A wild ride, implausible and ridiculous. But, yes, fun.:::1:::3/5
Saoirse Ronan is terrific. So is Cate Blanchett. But chase, chase, chase = No tension, no surprises. No fun.:::0:::3/5
Violent thriller is a high-stakes teen-assassin tale.:::1:::4/5
Bourne meets the Big Bad Wolf in Hanna, a techno-action fable about a teenage girl groomed to be an assassin.:::1:::4/5
If you're looking to find out how to make an action/spy thriller more than just an action spy thriller then look no further then Hanna.:::1:::8.55/10
Marvelous. Cate Blanchett is great as one of the wickedest witches since Margaret Hamilton. One of the ten best films of 2011.:::1:::A-
Like a good fairy tale, Hanna is easy to describe but hard to sum up ... it doesn't succeed at the genres it plays at as well as it could, but it succeeds at being something different brilliantly thanks to a game cast and sure-handed direction.:::1:::7.5/10
The script seems incomplete; the result is a distinctive movie that disappoints, despite a powerhouse set-up, some knockout sequences, a propulsive score by the Chemical Brothers and admirable cinematography and production design.:::0:::2.5/4
It successfully combines artistic pretensions and giddy action thrills in ways that will remind viewers favorably of similar genre mash-ups like "La Femme Nikita" and the Jason Bourne films.:::1:::4/5
Think La Femme Nikita facing down Bullwinkle Moose's Natasha Fatale, with breakneck running a la Run Lola Run. Add in borrowed sets from Fellini, and voila! Hanna is served -- sadly, not as well as it should be.:::0:::5/10
Bad-A**!:::1:::4.5/5
Cate Blanchett sounds like a drunk Dr. Phil.:::0:::1/4
A thinking person's action film with stylish fight scenes and a "Bourne"-like existential core.:::1:::B+
In "Hanna," the ingenious way the film comes together is almost as compelling as the story it tells.:::1:::3.5/4
The forced coming-of-age parable that filmmaker Joe Wright laces with fairy-tale symbolism is heavy-handed from the get-go.:::0:::2/5
A sure-footed action thriller.:::1:::B
The film is never more than an amalgamation of other movies.:::0:::2.5/4
Is it a great movie? No. Nagging questions and plot holes start appearing the minute the endorphins and adrenaline wear off. But it isn't a bad one, either.:::1:::2.5/4
The director's clever use of extreme landscapes and surreal sets keep us immersed in a visually stimulating world somewhere between fantasy and reality.:::1:::3/4
This J.V. "Salt" is effective only for a few minutes at a time, in some occasionally ripping action scenes set to a vivid Chemical Brothers score.:::0:::2/4
It doesn't have much to say and it doesn't leave you with much to think about. However, when the house lights come up, you may notice you haven't touched your popcorn.:::1:::3/5
An intriguing enough remix of well-established assassin-on-the-run routine whose greatest asset is its young star.:::1:::None
...a movie that doesn't understand where its real power lies.:::0:::2.5/5
A painstakingly composed, gorgeously expressive tone poem.:::1:::B-
For all the skill she has ... [Hanna] is ultimately reduced ... to just a little girl who becomes lost in the figurative forest after leaving the literal one.:::0:::2.5/4
It's a feast for the eyes, but we're still hungry.:::0:::None
"Hanna" is, on a certain level, ridiculous. But the way Mr. Wright conjures his images and parcels out his narrative is hypnotic and so seductive that wherever the film is heading we want to follow.:::1:::None
Visually and aurally, "Hanna" is a highlight so far in 2011.:::1:::3/4
...destined to leave audiences utterly divided...:::1:::3/4
A movie that, in the end, is no smarter than any other run-of-the-mill cinematic death fest, just grimmer, bleaker and sadder.:::0:::2/4
Too concerned with looking adult than being mature, and that's a death sentence for an action wannabe.:::0:::2.5/4
This slick thriller features inventive action sequences and terrific actors who offset more over-the-top moments.:::1:::B-
Wright applies an artful eye to carnage; he and production designer Sarah Greenwood exhaustively deploy their love for finding colors that mirror the characters' psychological states.:::1:::8/10
A chase-thriller for the art-house crowd, Hanna is brisk, satisfying and often surprising.:::1:::B+
With an A-list cast and incredible production values, Hanna is a speeding train. Hop on and hold on tight.:::1:::4/5
Little more than an action exercise, but an extraordinarily skillful one, a well-oiled machine that delivers an adrenaline rush of the first order.:::1:::B
Although its camera moves are fluid and its art direction elegant, Hanna doesn't travel anyplace unusual. The point of all its battling is just to battle.:::0:::None
On a purely physical level, Hanna grabs you by the throat and never lets go:::1:::4/5
Between the top-notch cast, cracking fight sequences, and pulse-pounding score courtesy of The Chemical Brothers, Hanna is the perfect appetizer for the summer season.:::1:::3.5/5
"Hanna" is almost a terrific movie, or a partly terrific one, but all its giddy, improvised wonder resolves into nothing more than a ruthless, symmetrical story about a murderous monster.:::0:::None
It's only when Ronan takes over that the film discovers a still, focused center.:::1:::2.5/4
In the end there might not be much to this tale other than titillation, but there's plenty to be said for Ms. Ronan, who was the best thing about "Atonement" and holds her ground against forceful screen presences like Ms. Blanchett and Mr. Bana.:::1:::3/5
Director Joe Wright takes one step further from his early period films with this stylish, head-tripping assassin thriller by way of Snow White.:::1:::A-
The film is an uneven affair, good enough that you wish it had fully succeeded.:::0:::2/4
There's some great fun in the film, and a bit of unexpected wit, and lots of action, much of it ludicrous but some quite engaging.:::1:::B
Hanna rocks.:::1:::3.5/4
Wright has crafted a dreamy-looking and exciting film that works as much as a moving coming of age story as it does a bone-crunching action thriller.:::1:::4 stars out of 5
There is not a single moment in the new film that is not striking or smartly put together or just plain considered. Wright leaves nothing to chance. I don't know that there's a better way to smother a movie.:::0:::2.5/4
Wright's direction starts out realistically enough but gradually deteriorates into what feels like a messy parody of a European art film.:::0:::2.5/4
The film exists in a peculiar no-man's land between Hollywood and art.:::0:::C+
Because they have nothing to gain from this, logic would dictate that they just stay put, but then the movie couldn't turn into a live-action video game with a preteen piling up bodies like Rambo.:::0:::None
"Hanna" presents the problem of the well-made diversion that is, at its core, repellent.:::0:::1.5/4
Ultimately, and just like its titular antiheroine, it becomes its own fantastic and feral beast, undomesticated and slathering bloody good fun all over the audience.:::1:::3.5/5
Ronan's pale blue eyes can seem vulnerable or inscrutable, wistful or deadly.:::1:::3/4
Wright knows enough to fix his camera straight ahead on Ronan's otherworldly face. Despite having already been nominated for an Oscar, Ronan's presence feels like a revelation.:::1:::4/5
Hanna starts out edgy and fresh, but runs out of steam and imagination, ending up, after many obligatory chases, in the same old place.:::0:::None
[Ronan] has a strange sort of expressiveness that keeps Hanna from being a dull, blank slate.:::1:::B
Wright knows how to tell a story; he just doesn't seem to know how to tell this one.:::0:::2/4
This fairy tale may be Grimm, but it's also quite gripping.:::1:::3/4
While the sum of its parts do not add up, Saoirse Ronan shines brightly in this film.:::0:::2.5/5
[A] contrived, overwrought splat of arty hackwork.:::0:::None
Hanna is a fairy tale of lightning speed, gritty action and shocking gravity, all driven by the electronic beat of a hypnotic score by the Chemical Brothers.:::1:::3.5/4
What makes the scenario seem so unique and fresh is the way Wright tells the tale.:::1:::None
A well-done thriller with fairy tale sequences, a surprising secret, and a 16-year-old girl who soldiers into the world.:::1:::4/5
Odd, scatterbrained and sometimes a little too clever, but it's also passionate and captivating, combining a coming-of-age tenderness with heart-stopping action in a way that feels utterly unique.:::1:::4/5
If the late director Krzysztof Kieslowski had made a mainstream film, it might have looked a lot like this one.:::1:::3.5/4
The year's coolest movie so far.:::1:::3.5/4
Wright combines his two genres into a stylish exercise that perversely includes some sentiment and insight.:::1:::3.5/4
Distinctive Heroine separates Hanna from the pack.:::1:::3.5/4.0
The fact that Ronan is this good at this young age is what's truly frightening here.:::1:::None
It's Ronan who carries the film. She got a best-supporting-actress Oscar nomination for Wright's "Atonement," but here she's asked to do much more, and she nails it.:::1:::4/5
A picture-book story about complicated daddies, wicked stepmothers, and daughters who learn to be brave in the dark woods.:::1:::B+
Joe Wright continues to prove himself as one of the more innovative filmmakers working today.:::1:::7.5/10
After two stuffy movies and one that stiffed, Joe Wright seems determined to prove he can direct a popcorn movie with Hanna. If you're seeking a higher-brow version of The Professional and take-your-pick of the Bourne flicks, here it is.:::0:::B-
Hanna kicks ass.:::1:::3.5/5
"Hanna" is kinetic, vibrant, sometimes a completely insane adventure; one of the best times you'll have at the movies this year.:::1:::4.5/5
Despite its 21st-century trappings and proto-feminist protagonist, Hanna strangely reverts to reactionary politics as usual.:::0:::None
A Grimm acid trip...a slow burn of oddity, occasionally hitting a few chaotic beats before it's back on a unique prowl. Original and often fearless, Hanna is an exceptional cinematic wonderland.:::1:::A-
An intriguing, original thriller that owes as much of a debt to the likes of Frankenstein, the Brothers Grimm, David Lynch, and A Clockwork Orange as to The Professional and The Bourne Identity.:::1:::3.5/4
A fast-paced action film that entertains without particularly engaging the viewer emotionally. It follows the formula perfectly and creates excitement when it's meant to.:::1:::None
The result is unbearable junk. What went wrong? Just about everything.:::0:::1/4
Heart missed, but spine tingled.:::1:::None
Imminently watchable, Hanna suggests a thinking-person's Kick-Ass.:::1:::None
Now THIS is kick-ass movie making! With snap and verve, Joe Wright has taken a traditional film genre and stood it on its ear.:::1:::None
The surprising thing about Hanna is that for the first hour and change, it kind of makes you like the bill of goods it's selling...:::1:::3/5
An adrenaline-packed vehicle that delivers a multi-directional sugar rush. It moves so quickly that the bells and whistles blur together.:::1:::None
Brilliantly executed, art-house/action mash-up. Truly unique.:::1:::9/10
[director] Wright's surreal visuals and anti-establishment attitude make Hanna a radically original action experience.:::1:::4.5/5
Happythankyoumoreplease is a charming and refreshing romantic comedy. Radnor is great in the role and provides an uplifting and enjoyable film.:::1:::7/10
Let's hope "The New Zach Braff" learns from the original Zach Braff to strike while the iron is hot and not dither away his potential waiting for that perfect "next project" to come along.:::1:::3/4

Sam and Rasheen's icky pas de deux is coarsely shoehorned into a movie that juggles three tepid romantic mini-dramas.:::0:::1/5
resembles a sitcom -- but the good kind, or at least one you might not flip past immediately on a Monday night:::0:::2.5/5
Familiarity is the problem with Josh Radnor's strangely titled writing/directing debut.:::0:::C-
The territory has been well mined, most famously in Reality Bites and Garden State.:::0:::2/5
It's co-star Malin Ackerman who proves to be more than a pretty face.:::1:::3/4
It's sluggish and trite and irrelevant in a way that suggests that the TV soundstage is a kind of hothouse that Radnor doesn't leave often enough.:::0:::2/4
What will they do? And, more important, why should we care about their trivial hipster quandaries?:::0:::None
According to the rules of grown-up cinema, Happythankyoumoreplease should be irritating as hell. Well, Radnor's worked some magic.:::1:::None
The comedy is called "Happythankyoumoreplease," but a better title would be "Icknogoaway.":::0:::0/4
[A] perky, if undistinguished, emulation of a mid-period Woody Allen relationship comedy...:::0:::2.5/4
These three vaguely intersecting plots have plenty of nice moments among them and performances that shine, especially Mara and Hale's.:::1:::3/5
A case of when bad scripts happen to good actors. Given its similarities to a bygone sitcom, one might call it Friends without benefits.:::0:::1.5/4
There is a sweetness to Radnor's character and to his film. What there is not is a sense of urgency, of a desire to find out what happens next.:::1:::3/5
None of the relationships that drive this awkward dramedy ring true and only a few supporting performances make the effort worthwhile as they highlight the weaknesses at the core of the manipulative script.:::0:::2.0/5.0
[T]he guy learns that kidnapping is all right, as long as you have good intentions and your best friend's sort-of boyfriend works in the legal department of their office.:::0:::1.5/4
It's an observant and heartfelt film, with turns of dialogue that show that writer-director Josh Radnor really can write.:::1:::3/4
Reflects a romantic/shallow view of happiness and clarity (just have it!) muddled by a refusal to really chip away at situations that neither click separately or as a unit.:::0:::2.5/4
Kate Mara gives a breakout performance. She should be a star.:::1:::3.5/5
Radnor shows an assured hand with his cast, and rather than try to force a plot the actor-director defines his film by the characters.:::1:::7/10
It's very unusual that a movie can be both over-ambitious and half baked.:::0:::None
Radnor's script is well-attuned to the lonely disorientation of being young and less than wealthy in the increasingly gentrified, high-end Big Apple.:::1:::3/4
As if this weren't enough baggage for one movie, especially an indie movie, Radnor front-loads the proceedings with further complications.:::0:::B-
Radnor offers an entertaining and not especially self-indulgent ensemble comedy about young love in the big city that spotlights an appealing cast of youthful fringe-of-Hollywood talent.:::1:::None
The glue subtly holding everything together for Footloose is the intelligent and atmospheric direction of Craig Brewer, best known for his superb handling of the cult classic Hustle and Flow.:::1:::3/5
It may adhere to the original a little too closely, but this remake is still an immensely enjoyable ride boosted by Craig Brewer's pitch-perfect musical instincts.:::1:::None
Nothing about this remake challenges the original. What it does do is introduce a new generation to a great story with heart and there really can't be anything wrong with that.:::1:::3/5
Brewer's camera clings to the bodies of the dancers who emit more heat than the burning Southern sun.:::1:::3.5/5
This is a squeaky clean teen movie, really. I was amazed at how people don't know how to direct dance these days.:::0:::2.5/5
The young cast are engaging, especially Miles Teller in the role originally played by Christopher Penn.:::1:::3/5
Not even a rather obvious lack of interest in the adult actors amongst can stop Footloose from finally becoming the film that 1980s nostalgia would have us assume the original is.:::1:::None
Brewer, who previously put his high-intensity spin on Hustle & Flow and Black Snake Moan, displays his coolest moves in the way he smartly unties this Footloose from its 1980s moorings.:::1:::A-
From start to finish, Brewer's remake exudes the look and style of its forebearers: semi-awkward dance choreography, clunky dialogue and an obedience to formula that borders on cliche. But somehow, it works.:::1:::3/5
[W]e have... turned into four-year-olds who want to watch nothing but the same Blue's Clues DVD over and over again...:::0:::None
Footloose is a fun, energetic and sexy remake which successfully remixes its cult classic predecessor to make for an entertaining time at the flicks.:::1:::3.5/5
Foot-tapping fun, sexy dancing, romance and making changes are the mainstays of this likeable, high energy remake of the 1984 classic:::1:::None
Footloose is a solid dance film that should find a new, appreciative audience with a younger generation that doesn't hold the '84 film in as high esteem as audiences over 40.:::1:::B
Will win you over with its refreshingly fun take on a beloved '80s classic as it showcases some fine new talent.:::1:::8/10
Craig Brewer directs films like a man with electricity emanating from his fingertips. It feels like his pictures might, at any point, ignite into a fiery ball of sex ... Footloose is what we talk about when we talk about having fun at the movies.:::1:::4/5
An unlikeable main character and a weak narrative flow turn Hesher into a mediocre film.:::0:::6/10
Fortunately, there's enough humor in all this to counteract the exploitation of weird logic and audacious coincidence.:::1:::3.5/5
Susser cowrote the script, which relies on moments of profanity and impulsive violence to elicit terse little laughs and a melodramatic backstory to signal emotional resonance.:::0:::C+
Powered by a character at once original and representational, Hesher courses with a unique verve missing in many independent productions, hovering somewhere between outright success and 'interesting failure.':::1:::C+
Since [Gordon-Levitt's] one of the most energetic and inventive young actors in the business, you can't take your eyes off him. Unfortunately, the quality of the material makes you wish you could.:::0:::C+
Headbangs straight into your heart.:::1:::4/5
While it arrives decorated with cooler hair and a louder soundtrack, it still sticks to the "Unusual Outsider Teaches Middle-Class People What It Means to Really Live" template.:::0:::2.5/5
Gordon-Levitt ... gets to play the opposite of his usual put-upon nice-guy roles - and he runs with it, to the point of making Hesher downright scary a lot of the time. The rest of the cast keeps up with him, in their less flashy roles.:::1:::None
The strength of Hesher is its acting. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is back to drawing on his natural power as an actor. He's skilled at creating absorbing human trainwrecks.:::1:::3.0/5
... a promising concept gradually morphs into a predictable indie flick.:::0:::4/10
Joseph Gordon-Levitt must be especially glad for this film to see the light of day, because his performance is award-worthy, a complete inhabiting of as unique a personality as you'll encounter in film.:::1:::8.5/10
...darkly funny and refreshingly blunt, giving a big middle finger to conventionality, and offering a rebel yell that's hard to ignore.:::1:::B
Some indie films seem to exist as exercises in strangeness, just to see how far they can go-and how long audiences will watch before screaming and running up the aisles. I stuck with Hesher till...:::0:::1.1/2
Director/co-scenarist Spencer Susser has a definite feel for Hesher and T.J.'s little corner of the world.:::1:::None
Happily, Hesher never lays things out too clearly. Just as you never know where he came from, it's hard to grasp where he's going, or even what he's doing in the moment. But you know he fits somewhere. And that's satisfaction enough.:::1:::B
Like a knock-off of Chuck Palahniuk produced by people raised only on Sundance films, "Hesher" is a mess.:::0:::1/5
Hesher himself [is] a mysterious, magnetic, repellent, and alluring figure... It's quite an astonishing performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt.:::1:::4/5
Gordon-Levitt is a sly and inventive actor, and it can be genuinely fun to watch him having so much fun. But this character wears out his welcome fast.:::0:::2/4
In his feature directorial debut, Spencer Susser establishes a deadpan, lost, grungy quality, the perfect place where a creature like Hesher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) might have evolved.:::1:::3.5/4
[Susser] keeps us on our toes, and even when his choices seem flashier than they need to be, there's a reason for them.:::1:::3.5/4
Rather than a character rooted in some sort of reality -- social, satirical, psychological, take your pick -- Hesher is an abstract notion animated by false energy.:::0:::None
Bad role models sometimes make the most interesting movie characters.:::1:::3/4
Unlike many films that hope to be called black comedy, it does not skimp on either the black or the comedy.:::1:::3.5/4
When the blessed credits finally roll, the first thing Susser shows us is Hesher's tattoo of a raised middle finger. Backatcha, dude.:::0:::1/4
At a future date, when some grad student writes a thesis on 'Wild Men of the Subconscious in Popular Culture,' there will certainly be a special place for 'Hesher.' Just as long as it stays there and is never in front of my eyes again.:::0:::1/5
A dark, weird, and wholly unique comedy that uses a bucketful of obscenity to help the sweetness go down.:::1:::B+
Beyond the fact that Hesher is a character to be despised instead of admired, Hesher is distanced from its characters and their situation in its apathy toward them.:::0:::1.5/4
"Hesher" is about as awful as independent films get, a mix of ugliness and unearned sentiment, with a flat story, repellent and pathetic characters and dialogue that consists of lots of stammering and cursing.:::0:::2/4
Susser, who wrote the film with David Michod, has a kinetic filmmaking style and an impish, crash-and-burn sense of humor that keeps sentiment at bay long enough to let us appreciate the loose, uncomplicated performances...:::1:::3/5
Hesher is a muddle of inchoate feelings that never really grasps the cliches to which it raises its middle finger.:::0:::2/5
As played by the spectacular Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Hesher is the id run rampant. Even when the script edges him into Hallmark sentiment, you can't take your eyes off him.:::1:::3/4
A grim little drama that seems to exist in order to give the talented Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Natalie Portman a chance to look extra-scruffy.:::0:::2/4
As equal parts tough, touching and resolute as the renegade saving-grace of the title, "Hesher" is an uncommonly perceptive cinematic revolution.:::1:::3.5/4
[Gordon-Levitt gives] a fearsome and giddily unhinged performance in a movie that isn't entirely sure what to do with it.:::0:::2.5/4
"Hesher" assembles a group of characters who aren't sure why they're in the same movie together.:::0:::2.5/4
Fit for the scrap heap which provides one of the heavy-handed visual motifs here.:::0:::None
Not even Mr. Gordon-Levitt's unremittingly savage performance can begin to salvage such hokum.:::0:::1.5/5
What does he want? Where does he come from? Director Spencer Susser appears too intoxicated by the title character to risk peering beyond the enigmatic surface for fear of losing some of his mystery, as mystery is all Hesher has.:::0:::D
One by one the wheels start to come off, and before it's over you're working on your own metaphors for when the film fell apart instead of cleaving to those Susser is half-committing to the screen.:::0:::6/10
It's unflinching stuff, and might have worked if there were a reason for any of it. Levitt, Portman and Wilson work hard to infuse the film with some likeability.:::0:::1.5/4
the film really picks up whenever Gordon-Levitt appears:::0:::3/5
Hesher has its genuinely affecting scenes, but too much of the time it feels false and shallow.:::0:::2/4
As director Spencer Susser's movie unfolds, the heart reveals itself to be less and less sentimental.:::1:::B
The performances, especially by Wilson and Laurie as the grandmother, keep Susser's earnest effort afloat. Consider it a promise of things to come.:::1:::2.5/4
Writer-director Spencer Susser and cowriter David Michod generate fresh hells at a surreally rapid clip but cop out with an incongruously sentimental ending.:::1:::None
Joseph Gordon-Levitt is riveting as the title character, an ambiguous, intriguing mentor/menace.:::1:::3/4
Director Spencer Susser doesn't try to make Hesher anything other than a sociopath - a walking, profanity-spewing id - and to his credit, neither does Gordon-Levitt.:::1:::8/10
Artifice is rodeo clowning for the script's flaws, with huge gaps of character development lost to a film that would rather stay on Hesher and his staring contests than tell a full-throated story.:::0:::D+
Hesher's such a mystery that he seems like a device (bong hits with Grandma, really?), and the same goes double for [Portman's character].:::0:::2.5/4
Hesher is funny and off-kilter without being cloying, and Gordon-Levitt gives an appealingly unpredictable performance.:::1:::3/5
Impressive influences all, but Susser's first film feels like an original -- imperfect but often fresh and true, and a worthy showcase for a star on the rise.:::1:::3/5
Hesher, whose arrival on screen is almost always heralded by a demonic speed-metal riff, is a delinquent sociopath with a heart of gold. That's the false, rather cloying conr very far.:::0:::2/5
Takes the themes of mumblecore (twentysomethings looking for love and life direction) and makes them into something more universal -- and, blessedly, less cynical, more full of hope.:::1:::3/4
Josh Radnor populates his irritatingly self-satisfied film with lonely romantics, as well as a wealth of cliches and abysmal aesthetic choices.:::0:::None
This unbearably cutesy and hackneyed movie is a vanity piece starring, and written and directed by, mild sitcom presence Josh Radnor.:::0:::0.5/4
There's a tenor of performance here that claws at sincerity, making the picture's tedious nature palatable for a few stretches, but hardly dispatches the brutal film fest-baiting atmosphere.:::0:::C-
A film whose extreme self-consciousness begins with the title and carries through.:::0:::2/5
Treating their problems like they're the most important crises in the world is what people in their 20s do, but that doesn't mean we have to go along for the ride.:::0:::2/5
HappyThankYouMorePlease features enough well-observed touches to prove Radnor deserved this shot...:::1:::B-
Fun but forgettable.:::0:::2/4
With very little modification, the relationship woes of the six chirpy young New Yorkers in this (happythankyoumoreplease) self-absorbed indie could be reworked into episodes of TV's How I Met Your Mother.:::0:::C+
A hit-and-miss romantic comedy, a little too eager to please but not without its charms...it's only disappointing when you consider how much better it might have been.:::0:::None
Arrested Development's Tony Hale nearly overcomes the gently worthless script.:::0:::None
As it is in any breakout comedy, it is performance that matters. Radnor is charming, while Kate Mara is red hot sexy and in no way the manic pixie dream girl.:::1:::None
Tony Hale's winning characterization of an improbably straightlaced suitor who woos the "quirky" Annie saves the movie from total disaster.:::0:::.5/4
Radnor should be more than pleased with his film debut, and this is how rom-coms should be made, not like the hapless Hollywood offerings.:::1:::4/5
happythankyoumoreplease goes down easy and charming without a bit of weight or meaning.:::1:::None
Extremely accessible and relatable with its cute, hip New York vibe and believable, well-written dialogue that doesn't force out stupid MySpace/Twitter/Facebook jokes in order to remind young audiences of how relevant it is.:::1:::None
Throughout the film we get about 87 montages, characters behaving like shallow idiots and not backing it up with the wit necessary to dare criticize Woody Allen.:::0:::1/4
With the exception of Akerman's Annie, the characters are uniformly annoying, their stories insubstantial and the tone one of smug contentment. Production values are grade-A.:::0:::None
Even though his characters' romantic troubles bedevil them, Radnor fails to make their plight empathetic, unintentionally turning them into whiny and self-involved individuals who don't always seem worthy of the happiness they seek.:::0:::None
This clearly is an actors' movie, and they all blossom in that environment.:::1:::None
The script is intermittently literate and frequently funny, the young cast (headed by Radnor) is highly appealing, and you can definitely imagine this movie finding a niche with a subset of the audience that turned (500) Days of Summer into a sleeper hit:::1:::3/5
They should have just brained the bunny. Would have gotten people talking.:::0:::D+
A miscast Russell Brand and some poor writing make the film nothing but a decent one time watch.:::0:::7/10
A chip off the old munk -- "Chipmunk." And that's not a good thing.:::0:::1.5/4
The story is really all over the place, but it's your only choice for an Easter Bunny movie for miles around, so expect to see this one cycled around again each spring.:::1:::3/5
Harmless but not exactly clever.:::0:::2.5/4
Hop starts out cute, but slowly dissolves into a mundane, droll experience completely derivative of Alvin and the Chipmunks and numerous Christmas movies.:::0:::3/10
It's not brilliant, but you probably already guessed that; this is a film about a mythical rabbit who poops jellybeans, after all...:::0:::2.5/5
Director Hill, who previously combined live action and animation with the second "Garfield" film as well as "Alvin and the Chipmunks," has a way of telling a story seamlessly.:::1:::4/5
Hop is populated with humour that is slow, dated and mindless, an ADD confection of half-baked slapstick and notions of the healing power of Easter chocolate.:::0:::1/5
Hop isn't charmless, but it is inert.:::0:::2.5/10
A mostly silent theater filled with kids is one indication of this failed venture, a clock-watching pace and overall lack of creativity are two more:::0:::D
Santa is SO last year.:::1:::3.5/5
Kids will love Brand's frenetic drumming take on E.B., adults will love that there are a few clandestine adult jokes.:::1:::B
As cute and cuddly as a plush, floppy-eared rabbit despite a character some may find offensive: a Spanish-accented chick named Carlos...plotting to dethrone the Easter Bunny.:::1:::B
Almost every scene's overscored, overtold or overdone to the point of the jokes getting runny. Hop seems to think filling out the formula and being super-duper eager-to-please is enough. Hobbling along, this bunny just ain't funny.:::0:::None
The bunny poops jelly beans, which provides a nice metaphor: The film is slick and colorful, but it's formulaic crap.:::0:::1.5/4
Eggcellent family fare.:::1:::3/5
full review at Movies for the Masses:::0:::2/5
Parts of this movie made me hopping-mad. But, hey, I'm a bunny and I hop a lot. It annoyed my two-legs, too, though, and she never hops.:::0:::2/4
... as sweet and tasty as a candy marshmallow chick -- and about as nourishing.:::0:::2/5
Perfectly pleasant, funny, if unexceptional Easter holiday movie.:::1:::3/5
[A] heavily marketed piece of unfunny.:::0:::D
Hop is the kind of movie that makes helpless critics wish we could stage an intervention. Parents! It doesn't have to come to this!:::0:::D-
Cute-and-cuddly, filled with frantic, family-friendly bunny banter, it's nevertheless derivative of 'The Santa Clause' and 'The Tooth Fairy' - and decidedly mediocre.:::0:::5/10
A clunky, mirth-challenged mix of live action and animation, Hop should be bounced to the back of the family's to-do list in the coming holiday period.:::0:::1.5/5
This was the first time in a long time I can remember really craving a piece of candy during a movie:::1:::None
You know that sense of childlike wonder you experience when you tear away the shiny foil and bite into a huge milk chocolate egg - only it turns out to be carob? Well, Hop is a carob egg.:::0:::None
I wish I could say that Hop is a complex remake of Scorsese's own controversial Easter movie, but it's more likely that any similarity between characters living, dead or reborn are completely coincidental.:::0:::2.5/5
An act of aggression against childhood.:::0:::3/10
The film is bright and breezy and the animation is first rate. Some of the jokes are lame, and it's more a film for younger, and less sophisticated children.:::1:::3/5
For the most part it tries too hard, lurching from one plot contrivance to another and never giving any of its cast (apart from the heroically hard-working Marsden) much to do.:::0:::2.5/5
There's something really creepy about the 37-year-old Marsden playing a guy who's still living with his parents, has no job, no friends, no girlfriend, and no interests.:::0:::1/5
Unpleasant, unfunny and uninspiring...:::0:::None
E.B. is brought to life by Brand, the CGI is seamlessly worked into the live action, and Hop is briskly paced. It's entertaining enough but ultimately disposable.:::1:::None
Very simple but very cute, this one's a sure hit with the littlies.:::1:::4/5
Overall, there's a Teflon quality to "Hop": it does the job, but it doesn't stick.:::1:::None
Adults will pretty much have to check their brains in at the door, sit back, and enjoy the popcorn and snacks.:::0:::5.5/10
For kids it may be a hit but for adults 'Hop' is a flop.:::0:::4/10
It's a perfectly averagely-executed movie for little kids that's marginally about the pleasures of sugar and furry animals. Nothing more, nothing less.:::0:::2.5/5
This is a very bad movie.:::0:::None
Gone are the days of childlike mystery, and in their place we have the childish Hop.:::0:::.5/4
If anyone needed a reason to boycott Easter, this it.:::0:::C-
The film is too concerned with providing inappropriate product placement for Playboy to bother with anything more than the most specious story beats...:::0:::2/5
It's a combination of the worst movies about trouble in Santa Claus's north pole toy factory and a version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory lethally laced with sugar.:::0:::None
The animated critter that is at the center of this mess makes for one odd chick.:::0:::None
Fulfills the "Golden Hasselhoff" rule, which holds that any work of "art" blessed with The Hoff's presence is all the better for it.:::1:::3/4
The bunny-gets-injured, slacker-saves-Easter plotline doesn't pack too much predictability but Brand does his best with the material and it's cute enough for kids.:::0:::2/5
An ultra cute family film catering for the under 12 set, Hop combines live action with the colourful animated world of the Easter bunny as it tells a happy story about families, expectations and dreams:::1:::None
Like the colorful candies of Easter, "Hop" is a pastel distraction lacking any kind nutritional value. Inside its foil wrapping exists an endless array of predictable jokes, aimless subplots and obnoxious characters. It's a disaster.:::0:::D+
Using animation and live action quite impressively, 'Hop' takes one reactionary myth and uses it to reinforce that myth as well as others:::0:::None
The lack of any comparable reality check will make this one an endurance test for most people who aren't five.:::0:::2/5
Most gags are as disposable as last week's colored eggs, but there's likable geniality that keeps Hop tolerable, hinging on your tolerance of Brand's cheeky style.:::0:::C
As fake and forgettable as a marshmallow Peep, "Hop" goes down easy enough. It's the thought of a talented actor stuck on an industry conveyor belt that leaves an unfortunate aftertaste.:::0:::2/5
Just like its sugary setting, Hop is designed to sugar coat everything, and cynically give Easter that commercial feel normally reserved for Christmas.:::1:::4/5
Hop is spectacularly charmless -- there's no spring in its step. The last thing we need is an Easter movie that comes limping down the bunny trail.:::0:::3/10
Though the integration of live action and animation is improving (especially a scene where E.B. cuddles with Fred's sister), it's still a slightly disorienting experience.:::0:::2.5/4
Silly animated/live-action holiday comedy is fun for kids.:::1:::3/5
The real disappointment, though, is Brand as E.B., giving a motor-mouthed G-rated spiel that denudes him of his R-rated personality.:::0:::2.5/5
Hop is just too shrill, slick and sickly sweet for anybody's good. Watching it won't rot your teeth, but it could leave an ugly cavity in your brain.:::0:::C-
Uninspired, bland, charmless and increasingly asinine. Only little kids might be fleetingly amused by the eye candy and sight gags.:::0:::4.89215/10
Hop can't even find anything funny to do with Kaley Cuoco.:::0:::C-
Hop is a hodge-podge of a movie in which stretches of dull subplots and narrative stagnation are broken up by an occasional good laugh.:::0:::2/5
It's like a cartoon root canal for your brain.:::0:::1/4
Colorful and disposable entertainment for the kids. Adults will be intermittently amused but will spend more time checking their watches.:::0:::2/5
Hop is a cheap chocolate Easter bunny of a movie; completely hollow, well beyond its sell-by date, and after it's finished you're left feeling a bit ill.:::0:::D
To put it succinctly: Hop is brain death.:::0:::1/5
[The film is] infused with a demented, genuinely subversive spirit that comes straight from Russell Brand, who voices E.B.:::1:::4/5
A fun and funny mix of live action and animation that puts the hop back into Easter.:::1:::None
Thus we have Hop, which I'm sad to say isn't all that bad, and isn't all that good. It's as if it knew it had the holiday all sewn up and didn't even bother to try very hard.:::0:::2.5/4
Hop integrates animated characters into live-action settings, relying on director Tim Hill to handle the logistics of convincingly blending both worlds.:::1:::None
Flop would be closer.:::0:::1/5
While the world's desperate cries for more sequels to The Santa Clause go unanswered, Universal Pictures brings us the next best thing.:::0:::C
Even the most undemanding of children won't enjoy this sickly confection that would have benefited from better one-liners. Or a dose of myxomatosis.:::0:::1/5
...a dull and aggressively mediocre comedy...:::0:::None
It may be okay for kids under 10 but this anodyne movie will try the patience of the family audience for whom it strives mightily.:::0:::2/5
Marsden has charisma to spare and is clearly game for the many pratfalls, but the more fantastical AND entirely animated sections of the film set in the factory are far superior.:::0:::2/5
Witty scripting spices up a sugary scenario, giving this fluffy family comedy some adult-pleasing bite. It ain't Shrek, but it ain't dreck either.:::1:::3/5
It's supposed to be sweet, but "Hop" is a headache waiting to happen.:::0:::1.5/4
Marsden is working it as he embraces the silliest of moments and makes us laugh.:::1:::3/4
"Hop" feels less like an attempt to tell a story than an attempt to reach out to as many marketing demographics as possible.:::0:::2/4
It will charm the training pants off of the audience for which it is intended -- without leaving parents constantly checking their watches.:::1:::2.5/4
Presented with the opportunity to do the first-ever big-budget Easter bunny flick mixing live action and animation, "Hop" gives us . . . a bunny who poops jelly beans.:::0:::1.5/4
It offers a glimmer of amusement, but only to kids still young enough to believe in the Easter Bunny.:::0:::2/4
"Hop" may not be the best holiday live animation, but its attempt is not terribly flawed.:::1:::3/5
I think mom, dad and the kids will have fun.:::0:::C+
It could be worse. That's not intended as praise -- just a sigh of mild relief.:::0:::2/4
You can practically hear the director shouting that at the actors before he rolls tape; 'It's just a kid's movie. Now dance, you monkeys!':::1:::1.5/5
This Easter, celebrate with a slice of rabbit pie at home while avoiding this film.:::0:::1.5/5
Despite some surface appeal, it is as hollow in the center as a chocolate rabbit.:::0:::C-
There is no denying how much better it might have been with an extra screenplay polish and a greater willingness from director Tim Hill to think outside the box.:::0:::2/4
A soulless and depressing film, with plasticky production design.:::0:::1/5
Kiddies might be eggcited by the critters and candy, but for most peeps, this bunny-buddy comedy delivers a mixed basket.:::0:::C
A fairly undistinguished but pleasant and easy-to-take holiday movie, with slow spots and silly spots and a handful of moments of inspiration.:::0:::2/4
Silly, energetic and mildly amusing.:::1:::3/5
Hop will win audiences over with its goofy charm.:::1:::None
All you really need to know about Hop - a godforsaken mixture of live action humans with animated rabbits - is that it's brought to you by the same geniuses who gave us Alvin And The Chipmunks.:::0:::1/5
Lays one big, though colorful, Easter egg.:::0:::D+
The bunny's cute, but the story's mangy in Hop, a forgettable family film that may play well to young tykes but won't hold the interest of parents or older siblings.:::0:::None
"Hop" is stuffed with humorous moments and clever gags.:::1:::2.5/4
The whole thing raises questions of the type it is almost embarrassing to contemplate; it's almost like "Donnie Darko," for little kids.:::0:::2.5/5
All in all, it's hard to know for whom "Hop" is made.:::0:::1/4
The only thing missing is any real wonder, imagination or comic verve.:::0:::2/5
"Hop" is hip. And sassy, speedy and slick. It's that rarest of surprises, a movie for kids that transcends age barriers.:::1:::3.5/4
Brand does manage to play an obnoxious creature with a kind of charm. He feels like the only person who doesn't need this movie.:::0:::1/4
Anyone bewailing the near-absence of tacky family films inspired by Easter need bewail no more: Hop has arrived to fill the void.:::0:::D+
...almost entirely witless.:::0:::D+
If the filmmakers had just made a movie about E.B. and his clever animated bunny world, they might have delivered a tasty Easter surprise. This one has been sitting in the back of the fridge too long.:::0:::2.5/4
The LA antics are woefully familiar, and not helped by Marsden's mugging.:::0:::2/4
Smaller kids will think E.B. is real, older kids will be bored by the story and adults will think David Hasselhoff must really need the money.:::0:::1.5/4
...the almost willfully brain-dead tone of Hop began trying my patience right off the bat.:::0:::1.5/5
Leap to another theater, and wait for something that's worth your family's time.:::0:::1/4
This is a movie convinced that a rabbit pooping jelly beans is the height of comedy.:::0:::2/5
The ideas are so uninspired and the direction so vanilla that the end result is nothing but a rotten egg.:::0:::2/5
Hop is hopeless.:::0:::1.5/5
A mild matinee ruckus that doesn't feature much in the way of creative invention or comedic might. However, candyholics and fans of David Hasselhoff will be delighted.:::0:::D+
What could have been a painfully childish animated Easter romp is given a shot of deranged humour and an above-average cast of voices and cameos.:::1:::3.5/5
Impressively animated, nicely written and gently amusing family comedy, enlivened by a terrific central performance from James Marsden and a weirdly note-perfect vocal effort from Russell Brand.:::1:::3/5
Skip, jump, run away, whatever! Do anything you have to do to avoid Hop, which treats its plot like a formality and its young viewers like brainwashed twits.:::0:::1/4
Hill mines the same seam of cuteness as in his earlier Alvin and the Chipmunks, with Brand's manic characterisation helping to paper over the cracks of a flimsy story.:::1:::3/5
If you're 12 or younger, you'll think it's hilarious. If you don't? It's going to be a long 95 minutes.:::0:::2.5/5
No amount of enthusiasm can make up for the shaky premise and half-hearted writing.:::0:::1.5/5
You'll laugh a lot at this colourful Easter treat, so hop to it.:::1:::4/5
It goes through the motions provoking a few chuckles, yet wastes Brand's flamboyant way with words by keeping him nailed down to the script.:::0:::2/5
Hill effortlessly blends state of the art CGI with winning animation.:::1:::3.5/5
It's Alvin and the Chipmunks with only one chipmunk, and (if possible) even less fun.:::0:::D
Hop has one of the cutest bunnies you'll ever see and plenty of other eye candy among its computer-generated visuals, yet there's not much bounce to the story behind this interspecies buddy comedy.:::0:::None
The bunny? It burns. Bad.:::0:::None
Dreary, forced, unfunny, juvenile without actually being stupid enough to provoke a laugh. At least it's not in 3D.:::0:::None
Brand is diffident and banal; he continues to lack versatility as an actor, seemingly more comfortable in his own skin.:::0:::2/5
It's a story kids have seen a thousand times, and even recently in a far cleverer, engaging and touching way (How To Train Your Dragon), and Hop brings nothing new or unique to the table.:::0:::2/5
It offers few surprises, and for your cept behind this smug indie dud...:::0:::C
Warts and all, "Hesher" is still a good shot in the arm.:::1:::None
Hesher finds uncommon sympathy for people at loose ends, and although Hesher himself is sentimentalized and backhandedly inspiring, he never softens into an actual role model.:::1:::None
Only the great Piper Laurie delivers dollar value. Otherwise, Hesher is to movies what graffiti is to a rotting fence.:::0:::1/4
Sundancey redemption-trajectory aside, the film is often unsentimentally tough and committed.:::1:::3/5
...Gordon-Levitt and Piper Laurie make for one of the year's most intriguing screen couples.:::1:::B-
Gordon-Levitt has an expressive deadpan, marvelous control of his eyebrows and an air of menace. His lean, leathery physique and flat-footed gait convey purpose.:::1:::None
The movie's piling on of miseries blurs the boundaries of goopy sincerity and cynical marketing; the calculated dose of daring melts into hearts-and-flowers sentiment.:::0:::None
The guitar solos blasting from Joseph Gordon-Levitt's sullen, arson-prone wasteoid's van can't drown out the dominant bleat of indie-therapy whine.:::0:::1.5/4
Dangerous, immoral and just plain wrong at parts, and that makes it fantasy. I don't even think it's wish fulfillment. It's just putting bold concepts on screen and asking audiences to deal with them.:::1:::None
[VIDEO] "Hesher" is an experimental film that attempts to be transgressive. It isn't.:::0:::D
Fascinating in its shaggy, offbeat way.:::1:::B
It manages to succeed with a pastiche of great casting and an unapologetic slant towards being anti-touchy-feely. Until it needs to be.:::1:::3/4
Moviegoers will have to admit the movie is true to itself.:::1:::None
Gordon-Levitt's Hesher is raw destruction and aggro comedy punctuated with a blast of crunching metal.:::1:::3/5
exactly the kind of film I was hoping I'd see at Sundance:::1:::9/10
Hesher is a risky gambit that's pleasingly provocative.:::1:::None
The problem with the script by Susser and David Michod, working from a story by Brian Charles Frank, is that Hesher's uncouth behavior is so aggressively pushed to single-minded, crudely exploitative effect.:::0:::None
"Hugo" is a magical cinematic experience, and a masterpiece so unlike anything Scorsese has made before. Captivating and original, it is the director's most human film yet.:::1:::10/10
Henceforth when people speak of movie magic they will think instantly of Martin Scorsese's mind-blowing 'Hugo.':::1:::A
Scorsese's moving and magical tribute to the pioneers of filmmaking.:::1:::4/5
A children's film for grownups - grownup film buffs.:::1:::3/4
A luminous triumph that may just remind you why our hearts leap when the lights go down in a movie theater.:::1:::A-
Scorsese is a master storyteller and one of the best directors working today. He doesn't need a gimmick like 3-D to prove this. His films speak more than enough for themselves and "Hugo" is no exception.:::1:::3.5/4
It's an ode to cinema; it's everything that modern cinematic audiences take for granted. This film is Scorsese's gift to an audience that isn't old enough to have ever heard his name.:::1:::5/5
If you've become a little cynical about going to movies due to inflated ticket prices, Michael Bay films and chatty audiences, Hugo may restore your faith in the wonder of cinema.:::1:::4/5
a paean to the birth and continual rebirth of movie magic:::1:::3.5/4
One of the year's very best, Hugo is a rousing, moving, poignant tale being told on many more levels than what is seen on screen.:::1:::9/10
...not only pays tribute to the splendors of filmmaking by talking about them but by demonstrating them. It's a picture for film lovers of all ages.:::1:::8/10
the most soulful, most personal fiction film in [Scorsese's] career:::1:::3/4
Hugo is far too charming, welcoming and beautiful to look at to be dismissed as one of those films that critics adore but audiences ignore.:::1:::4/5

On some very basic levels, Hugo just isn't very good.:::0:::2/5
This movie is magic and it honors all those magicians like Martin Scorcese who make dreams we can all share.:::1:::A
Scorsese's unlikely 3D family film takes an agreeably pragmatic stance, that we must embrace the past yet never deny progress.:::1:::4.5/5
A movie that needs to be appreciated for its finer aspects and deeper meaning if it is to be appreciated properly, which is noble enough but could feel exclusive to some.:::1:::4/5
Never mind that the tone wavers and the pace is mostly plodding, the film champions all the right things and the beautifully crafted images (in 3D glory) leave a lasting impression:::1:::None
There are many lovely things in this film it is easy to forgive its small shortcomings:::1:::None
Martin Scorsese takes a left turn into family film territory in Hugo and delivers a movie that celebrates the wonders which the imagination can conjure.:::1:::4/5
An exuberant and meticulous 3D spectacle by one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.:::1:::4.5/5
Scorsese, now in the winter of his career, has tapped into his own childlike passion for film with this late-period masterpiece.:::1:::None
It's not an adventure, but a loving tribute to all the broken things, and those who would fix them.:::1:::4/5
You can practically feel time stop in sync with the audience's halted breath. It's nothing short of wizardry.:::1:::4.5/5
Who knew? The director who put the rage in Raging Bull the fear in Cape Fear and the mean in Mean Streets could make a family-friendly, dazzling 3D film.:::1:::A-
In Hugo Scorsese not only tells an important story about early cinema, but delivers a film that is a passionate and convincing reminder of the essential role art and imagination should play in our lives.:::1:::4.5/5
Scorsese's exuberant, magical odyssey transports audiences to the dawn of cinema.:::1:::4.5/5
The energy that's behind all of [Scorsese's] films is definitely present here.:::1:::None
[Hugo is] movie that will probably appeal more to hardcore film nerds than to nine-year-olds, unless of course that youngster will grow into a movie geek. If that's the case, Hugo will be a touchstone in their cinematic development.:::1:::3.5/4
Being a hardcore cinephile (like Scorsese) might add a layer of enjoyment, but it certainly isn't a prerequisite for walking in the door. A sense of wonder, however, is.:::1:::None

A monument to wonder and excitement for all those still in knee socks or short trousers.:::1:::None
Behind the horrible marketing lies a brilliant movie.:::1:::3.5/4
A lovely, lavishly constructed dreamscape of long-ago movie magic, told with a spectacular flourish of modern-day movie magic all its own.:::1:::4.5/5
Beautifully filmed in 3D it, turns into an education for the viewer on a subject near and dear to director Martin Scorsese's heart.:::1:::9/10
Both a joyful and enchanting adventure tale and a loving tribute to the early days of cinema and one of its neglected pioneers.:::1:::None
Scorsese has pulled out all the stops - and keeps yanking.:::0:::2/4
Unlike any of the other Scorsese films.:::1:::A-
Hugo is an intensely personal statement from Scorsese, one not just about magic, but also the magic of cinema.:::1:::B+
An utterly beautiful film -- both visually and emotionally -- and itself an enchanting gift from Scorsese to film fans everywhere.:::1:::4/4
Hugo may not be entirely successful as a children's film, but as the culmination of a lifetime love of the pure magic of film, this movie is a gift to be treasured and revisited.:::1:::8.3/10
Hugo (3D) is a sumptuously crafted film that underlies Scorsese's aims of touching hearts, taking us to other places and providing us with striking visual memories.:::1:::3/5
...too long, but a sweet story with excellent acting.:::1:::7/10
As much as Hugo is being touted as Scorsese's foray into 3D, Melies' images, flat, awkward, and strangely beautiful, are its most memorable.:::1:::None
Wow. This is now my favorite film of 2011. It is beautiful to look at and a great nod to the nostalgia of cinema from a true master.:::1:::10/10
Is it possible that Selznick's award-winning book is even half as marvelous as the movie [Martin] Scorsese and writer John Logan have made from it? If so, I can hardly wait to read it.:::1:::5/5
Hugo is a moving, funny and exhilarating film, an imaginative history lesson in the form of a detective story.:::1:::None
Achingly beautiful.:::1:::4.5/5
Director Martin Scorsese brings us an enchanting Christmas gift ... a marvelously inventive and inspiring 3-D film that has a heartfelt holiday message.:::1:::None
'Hugo' was an amazing cinematic experience for me, even though I'm not a 3-D fan.:::1:::None
Hugo is a master filmmaker's gift to children. It teaches, in an age-appropriate way, why movies are important and why it's essential that we take care of them. One of Scorsese's best!:::1:::4/4
Opulent, dazzling, enchanting screen adaptation of a beloved children's book. It's family-friendly fun.:::1:::10/10
( ... ) goose down floating around the set takes Scorsese's hard-hitting career into soft new dimensions:::1:::5/5
Leave it to Martin Scorsese to use 3-D not as a gimmick, but as a means of drawing us into a unique and magical environment...:::1:::None
The lesson to be learned is that [Scorsese] should stick to what he knows best, for Hugo won't appeal to anyone, least of all kids.:::0:::2/5
The on-screen craftsmanship is impeccable, from Robert Richardson's stunning cinematography to Dante Ferretti's production design and Sandy Powell's costumes.:::1:::None
Hugo is cinema shining a light reverently up its own fundament.:::1:::3/5
A dreamy triumph for Scorsese:::1:::None
The film demands patience from children and adults alike -- in fact, it's simply too slow for young viewers -- but like great literature, if you immerse yourself in it, the rewards are plentiful.:::1:::3.5/4
As a crazy mix of Cinema Paradiso, Cronos and David Copperfield it's unusually stimulating family fare.:::1:::3/5
The man responsible for Raging Bull, Taxi Driver and GoodFellas has tackled his first family film. Not only that: it's in 3-D, and a must-see for anyone who loves cinema.:::1:::4/5
The heart-shaped story may be the key that sets Hugo in motion, but this rediscovery of the cinema de papa is most memorable for its technical wizardry and astonishing visual trickery.:::1:::None
Scorsese transforms this innocent tale into an ardent love letter to the cinema and a moving plea for film preservation.:::1:::None
Hugo's best moments are those that aren't actually Hugo.:::0:::3/5
It is glorious to be thrown and blown about in this make-believe metropolis. The digitally enhanced shapes and colours suggest Jeunet and Caro reworked by a polychromatic Piranesi.:::1:::5/5
As soon as the lights went up in the theater, I told my viewing companions that I honestly felt that seeing the film was a privilege.:::1:::5/5
[T]here's certainly much to admire here... [but] Hugo feels like two very different films inelegantly spliced together...:::0:::None
It's possible to see the attraction, but when people break into applause over the credits, some are going to be left cold.:::0:::2/5
It's a deeply felt piece of work, something which only Scorsese could have brought to the screen...:::1:::3/5
Beautifully photographed and well acted but the storyline, especially when Kingsley's character takes center stage, is tediously tiring:::0:::5/10
Martin Scorsese unleashes his devotion to the magic of movies with a zeal that is enchanting.&#8233;:::1:::3.5/4
For youngsters with a secret sense of wonder about how the world works, Scorsese is offering a golden key to a limitless world of make-believe.:::1:::5/5
A masterpiece of visual storytelling and a heartfelt homage to the industry that Scorsese has triumphantly made his own.:::1:::4/5
Beautifully made and superbly acted, Hugo features terrific 3D effects and stands as a charming love letter to silent cinema, but it's let down by a weak central plot and the script never quite connects on an emotional level.:::1:::3/5
It might be curtains for celluloid, but Scorsese, a boyish 69, clearly isn't leaving the stage any time soon. He directs every film with the passion of his first. And it shows.:::1:::4/5
Director Martin Scorsese's well-documented affection for all things cinema has never been more evident than in the enchanting and imaginative Hugo.:::1:::3.5/4
It sounds a bit strange to say this about the man who gave us Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and so many other classics of hardcore machismo, but Martin Scorsese's new movie Hugo is delightful.:::1:::4/4
Scorsese's best film since Goodfellas... a celebration of the transportive joy that comes from watching [movies].:::1:::9/10
The charming if overly gilded story of an unwanted teenage boy rescued by art and friendship.:::1:::None
Something very rare: a celebration of past achievement that doesn't succumb to nostalgia.:::1:::3.5/4
This love letter to the movies is something to cherish.:::1:::4/5
Thematic potency and cinematic virtuosity -- the production was designed by Dante Ferretti and photographed by Robert Richardson -- can't conceal a deadly inertness at the film's core.:::0:::None
This is a great director's greatest love story.:::1:::5/5
For all the wizardry on display, Hugo often feels like a film about magic instead of a magical film...:::1:::None
Scorsese uses 3D to submerge viewers into a glittering storybook world, but all of Hugo's beauty can't make up for the sidetracking of the tale of the orphaned boy living in the train station in favor of a film preservation PSA.:::0:::2.5/5
If however, you are not a film scholar or a fan of the period, Scorsese will skillfully turn you into one without you even knowing it.:::1:::5/5
Scorcese does not mess around. This is a magnificent film.:::1:::None
The movie itself runs a bit long at 127 minutes, but "Hugo" is worth every minute for the visual feast it provides.:::1:::None
Hugo is a love affair -- palpable and personal -- between director Marty Scorsese and cinema. It sputters, floats, and soars.:::1:::3.0/5
An infectious ode to the early days of cinema. Scorsese's use of 3D is inspired, although it might be more interesting for parents than their children.:::1:::8/10
A powerful reminder of the magic of cinema and Martin Scorsese's astounding versatility...:::1:::4/5
"Hugo" is a movie that children will enjoy, adults will admire and film buffs will cheer. It is a movie that will surprise and delight you with its wonder and awe.:::1:::4/4
Exquisite - Definitely Oscar Worthy:::1:::5/5
... a phantasmagorical fusion of 'Oliver Twist' and 'Edward Scissorhands' ... but in the end it feels pedantic and, like Melies' robot, proves a wondrous contraption motorized by a spring-driven heart.:::1:::3/4
Hugo is a work steeped in cinema lore, drunk on the fumes of a bygone era yet canny enough to channel its nostalgia through modern innovations.:::1:::3.5/4
Please, please, please don't think you need to be a child to see this incredible movie. Indeed, "Hugo," a smart, classy film that deserves to be watched on the big screen in 3-D, will find a special place with grownups who love movie art and history.:::1:::4
A deeply felt, hugely personal, glorious and heart-swelling ode to the magic of cinema and stories: the way they bring us together, allow us to understand each other, allow us to see our dreams come true.:::1:::None
Probably the first kids film in history to double as a propaganda film for the cause of classic film preservation. And I mean that in the nicest possible way.:::1:::4.5/5
It has its sluggish moments, but Hugo is mostly a delightful tribute to the magic of early cinema, and boasts excellent use of 3-D.:::1:::B+
Martin Scorsese's affecting, gorgeously rendered 3-D debut is one of the best films of this year and any other year.:::1:::4/4
...the best children's movie of the century so far:::1:::89/100
Believe it or not, the director of Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and The Departed has made a family adventure for the ages.:::1:::5/5
I have seen the future of 3-D moviemaking, and it belongs to Martin Scorsese, unlikely as that may sound.:::1:::None
It's a fairy tale for mature viewers, but the airy exterior hides emotional depth.:::1:::3.5/4
One of the most magical viewing experiences of the decade so far.:::1:::5/5.0
Like a labyrinth larded with shards of celluloid sensations past and filtered through the latest in Tinseltown commercial gimmickry, Hugo is an amazing masterwork.:::1:::4.5/5
...an attentively crafted reminiscence of wonderment remembered, rather than wonderment experienced.:::1:::B
The fact that the images are so finely cut with stunning detail helps keep viewers engaged but the pretty pictures aren't enough to carry the film.:::1:::5.5/10
Under the hand of a lesser director, it might have been a plodding bore, but with Scorsese's brilliant use of the tools of the medium, it's a gorgeous, brilliant film.:::1:::4/5
People who think of Scorsese only in terms of crime films sell him short, and they are the ones who will miss out on this thrilling, beautiful movie that believes we each have a place and a purpose, and true peace only comes from finding it.:::1:::A+
Aside from being one of Scorsese's most personal films, it's also one of the least cynical films of this or any other year.:::1:::5/5
Hugo and Scorsese have found a way to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt the usefulness of the 3D format.:::1:::4.5/5
Hugo is a potent argument for films being the realization of dreams. There are real moments of danger, clear consequences, and sympathetic characters all around, so when tears come at the end of the movie, they feel earned.:::1:::3.5/4
Scorsese has created a world of wonder... in his elaborate adaptation of Brian Selznick's illustrated book The Invention of Hugo Cabret.:::1:::None
Hugo is a celebration of film and its power to create magical, dreamlike worlds.:::1:::3.5/5
Hugo is the kind of movie you will fall in love with and want to share with everyone.:::1:::88/100
Scorsese has the perfect vehicle to look at the notion of a contemporary society that tosses out the old to make way for the new, instead of venerating what has come before.:::1:::None
Hugo is a mixed bag but one well worth rummaging through.:::1:::B+
In the film, the title character finds a broken-down automaton, a robot that he works to fix with his father. Hugo the film is not unlike that automaton - stunningly made but hollow and expressionless.:::1:::3.5/5.0
One of the first movies since Avatar that absolutely must be experienced in 3D, it takes a bit longer to pull you into its world but leaves you fully satisfied with the experience.:::1:::8/10
Scorsese films the action with immense brio, his cameras swooping and dashing along platforms and tracks, ladders and walkways, snaking round the clock's intricate gears.:::1:::4/5
Can maestro Martin Scorsese sell today's youth on a Paris-set 3-D steampunk adventure that takes them to film history school?:::1:::A minus
Scorsese has created an exquisite jewel box of a movie, polished and honed to glittering, diamond-hard brilliance.:::1:::4/5
I found Hugo to be unrewarding, despite its impressive look.:::1:::3.5/5
The film is really about Scorsese sharing with us, on a deep visceral level, his extraordinary affection for the medium that's his passion, his profession, his everything.:::1:::4/4
Filled with more passion, emotion and drama than most "Oscar contenders" of 2011, Hugo transcends its fantastical predecessors.:::1:::4.5/5
Spectacular book adaptation is great for tweens and up.:::1:::5/5
tremendous and beautiful:::1:::4.5/5
A movie for grown-up film buffs, but one children can enjoy, so long as they don't mind a history lesson on the founding fathers of cinema, complete with 3-D visual aids.:::1:::3/4
Just as sure as Hugo will make some viewers restless, it's also guaranteed to provide everyone who sees it with an astonishing array of dazzling sequences to remember forever.:::1:::4.5/5
A free-flowing and enchanting celebration of movie-making, finding the way home, and the kind of caring that can transform the lives of others.:::1:::4.5/5
Scorsese and his team have now set the 3D bar so high that filmmakers will have to create a whole other dimension ... just to keep up.:::1:::9/10
Although it brings Scorsese together with people and techniques he hasn't worked with before, it also touches on themes close to his heart: the birth of cinema, and its preservation.:::1:::3/4
"Hugo" is as much a tribute to the medium that gave [Scorsese] life as it is to the magical world Selznick created in his illustrated book.:::1:::3.5/4
An absolute wonder to behold for viewers of all ages.:::1:::None
Scorsese's Hugo is oversized, ambitious and expensive-looking - and still it manages to be lovely, which is the hardest task of all to pull off, even for an alleged movie genius like Scorsese.:::1:::9/10
Scorsese's film is a richly illustrated lesson in cinema history and the best argument for 3-D since James Cameron's Avatar.:::1:::4/4
From Harry Potter, we know children appreciate magic when it comes from a wand. Hugo asks, in convincing fashion, that they see it in a simple flickering light.:::1:::4/5
As befitting both its fetishistically detailed source material and the era in which it's set, Hugo is Scorsese's most visually accomplished film.:::1:::None
Hugo is pure movie magic.:::1:::A
An ode to the making of movies and the sacred art of turning dreams into reality.:::1:::5/5
Quite a charming, engaging and entertaining delight about movies of yesteryear and their effect on those who made and saw them. (Parental Movie Review also available):::1:::None
Exquisite technical achievements that encourage a genuine sense of awe, yet it's a production better valued for its ambition than execution, with Scorsese caught between his ease with gloom and his inexperience with warmth.:::1:::B-
Hugo is gorgeous movie-making that, in the end, feels mostly like an homage to itself.:::1:::4/5
If ever the movie gods were to smile on an adaptation, it would be Scorsese's take on Selznick's bestselling book, a valentine to the cinematic artists whose work the filmmaker has toiled so tirelessly to champion and preserve.:::1:::3/4
It's as if David Copperfield wandered into a History of Film lecture. Maybe it isn't a great idea to wait till you're nearly 70 to make your first kid movie.:::0:::2/4
A state-of-the-art affair, an epic adaptation of Selznick's pretty-epic-itself tome, full of dazzling visuals and rapturous tributes to Melies and the magic of movies.:::1:::3/4
Movie magic hangs in the air of Martin Scorsese's Hugo, much like the steam and dust that fills almost every frame.:::1:::2.5/4
Beautifully shot by Robert Richardson and designed by Dante Ferretti, making 1930s Paris pulsate again... It is a striking technical achievement bordering on indulgent. But when things are this lovely, you indulge.:::1:::B+
Martin Scorsese's love letter to filmmaking finally proves that 3D is a necessary aesthetic to storytelling if used correctly. I definitely shed a few nerd tears!:::1:::5/5
Arthur C. Clarke once wrote that 'any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.' It's a sentiment that Scorsese seems to have taken to heart...:::1:::None
A slow starter, Hugo gradually evolves into a grand celebration of the art of filmmaking that rivals anything of its ilk, including Cenema Paradiso and Day for Night.:::1:::3.5/4
Here is a special film, overflowing with unanticipated delights.:::1:::4/4
A thrillingly immersive adventure.:::1:::A-
Extravagant but unpretentious, a touching fable with a thoughtful message and eye candy galore. It's one of the year's richest entertainments.:::1:::3.5/4
Bursting with earned emotion, Hugo is a mechanism that comes to life at the turn of a key in the shape of a heart.:::1:::None
Scorsese has skillfully reimagined the book in a way that could bring early film classics alive for young people.:::1:::3/4
An odd combo of Babe: Pig in the City and Godard's Histoire(s) du cinema, Hugo is the strangest bird to grace the multiplex in a while.:::1:::3/5
An endearing homage to a pioneering master of the movie medium, Georges Melies, from that most masterful modern-day moviemaker, Martin Scorsese.:::1:::3/4
Nearing age 70, Scorsese has given the joyful boy inside him a chance to play, and the result is a superb film and a delight.:::1:::A-
A haunting, piquant melodrama about childhood dreams and yearnings, enhanced with a pleasant survey course in early film history.:::1:::A-
Can we take back the Oscar for The Departed and give it to Hugo instead?:::1:::A
"Hugo" is a miracle of storytelling and technology.:::1:::4/4
"Films have the power to capture dreams," Melies said, and the way they've captured Scorsese's can't be denied.:::1:::3.5/5
A film that somehow works both as a love letter to the joys to be derived from the cinema, as spectator and creator alike, and as a marvelously engrossing and high-spirited adventure that is as enchanting as any of the "Harry Potter" movies:::1:::5/5
A personal statement disguised as a sellout.:::1:::None
Though it's bogged down by a dreadfully slow and mostly uneventful first act, the movie eventually finds its groove as a rather enchanting valentine to cinema that any film lover will appreciate.:::1:::3.5/5
Scorsese makes an eloquent plea to remember the past ... When a character in the film remarks that movies are where dreams are made, it's no mere boast.:::1:::3.5/4
But the child at the center of the story, looking back more than a hundred years to the wellspring of his art, is Scorsese himself.:::1:::None
...often plodding, the plot unfolding as if through a sea of molasses. The only real audience for this is film critics, scholars and buffs.:::1:::B-
Visually dazzling fantasy is both a 3D landmark and a warm personal tribute by Martin Scorsese to early movie pioneer Georges Melies.:::1:::None
Scorsese's mad infatuation with films and filmmaking streams through every frame of this gorgeous adventure.:::1:::3.5/4
Ultimately, the biggest disappointment of Hugo is that it fails to make the case for 3-D as a legitimate tool for the serious filmmaker.:::0:::2/4
Scorsese's mastery of the medium is evident in every frame of his beguiling adaptation of Brian Selznick's children's book, which is also the director's love letter to the art of cinema itself.:::1:::A
It's serious, beautiful, wise to the absurdity of life and in the embrace of a piercing longing.:::1:::4.5/5
Yes, "Hugo'' is a family film and, yes, your children and your inner child stand to be enraptured, but the family Scorsese really made this for is the 100-year-old tribe of watchers in the dark.:::1:::4/4
One of the rare films where 3D is worth the money and those ugly glasses. However, that's far from the only thing to recommend about his family-friendly - heck, human-friendly - story.:::1:::4/4
It's a complex fusion of film history and personal history, filled with dazzling embellishments and unabashed sentiment about the glories of cinema.:::1:::A-
Recognizes the fragility of youth while affectionately saying, 'Believe it or not, kids, your parents had lives before you came along. And they went to the movies too.':::1:::3/4
Scorsese's "Hugo" is a hugely ambitious and wholly satisfying feat. It's a living lesson in movie magic wrapped in a classic kiddie flick.:::1:::3.5/4
"Come and dream with me," a filmmaker pleads in Martin Scorsese's exquisite fantasy "Hugo," offering an invitation that's clearly extended from Scorsese himself.:::1:::5/5
[It's] as much of a personal Scorsese picture as Raging Bull or Taxi Driver. In some ways, this could be his most heartfelt movie.:::1:::3/4
"Hugo" is big, and it exists mainly to dazzle, but its storytelling ambitions are more modest. I enjoyed it more than many a later Scorsese picture.:::1:::3/4
What Scorsese has really made is a beautifully crafted love letter to movies, the passion of his life. What sounded like an odd pairing winds up being a perfect fit.:::1:::4.5/5
[VIDEO] Martin Scorsese's foray into the fantasyland of children's cinema via Brian Selznick's delightful children's graphic novel is a visually and emotionally rich love letter to the creativity of French filmmaker Georges Melies.:::1:::A
Thoroughly enchanting. Transports us into a magical world of movies, yet looks forward in its embrace of dreams and imagination. The first truly artistic use of 3D I've seen.:::1:::None
If Martin Scorsese is going to do a family-friendly film in 3D, it should be no surprise that it turns out to be a visually stunning (if ponderous and over-long) tribute to nothing short of the invention of cinema.:::1:::3/4
What makes this Scorsese's best film since The Age of Innocence is the curious view he takes of both this boy and the sea of artifice in which he's set adrift.:::1:::3/4
In Hugo, the hero has a terrifying dream, perhaps an unconscious recollection of that event. Reality, filmed illusion, and dreams are so intertwined that only an artist, playing merrily with echoes, can sort them into a scheme of delight.:::1:::None
This isn't a stuffy exercise for movie buffs. It's a real and touching story, full of childlike wonder.:::1:::3.5/4
"Hugo" is unlike any other film Martin Scorsese has ever made, and yet possibly the closest to his heart: a big-budget, family epic in 3-D, and in some ways, a mirror of his own life.:::1:::4/4
A plea for film preservation made in the medium that's killing it, Hugo unwittingly proves that old movies really were better.:::0:::2.5/4
Hugo emerges as a spectacular adventure for film lovers of all ages.:::1:::3.5/4
Magical and imaginative, this eye-popping masterpiece from director Martin Scorsese will transport audiences to a place they won't believe.:::1:::5/5
A wondrous blend of fantasy and mystery that will appeal to adults as well as children.:::1:::3.5/4
buck all you'll essentially get is a cringe-inducing dance number, lame gags and an admittedly alluring display of oversized chocolate. Avoid.:::0:::2/5
There are not enough chocolate eggs in the world that could save this dud of an Easter Bunny movie.:::0:::1.5/5
Despite its scattered frenzy, Hop -- thanks to its fondness for smushing together seemingly incongruous elements and Marsden's goofy, bug-eyed mugging -- is just demented enough to deliver a fleeting sugar rush.:::1:::None
Looks suspiciously like a cack Santa flick in which the fat red guy's been switched with a talking rabbit.:::0:::2/5
The final third marks a jarring shift into increasingly silly territory, but the build-up and jump-scares are effective.:::1:::3/5
This is a movie that wants to be several movies at once. It turns out to be none of them.:::0:::C
Insidious is effectively creepy and is able to provide some great horror elements without the gore.:::1:::8/10
After a suspenseful and shock-filled first hour, it loses control and veers off into routine supernatural silliness. I hate it when that happens.:::0:::None
The best horror movies get the audience talking back to the screen. "Insidious" manages that, and how...:::1:::3/4
About as subtle as a fart at a seance:::0:::2/5
There's nothing wrong with its standard set up which has an unsuspecting family haunted by spirits. However, when it comes time for the film to follow through on the plotline, we find out the filmmakers weren't quite up to the task.:::0:::2.5/4
Reminds of those mazes during Halloween, where figures jump out of the shadows and attempt to scare you--and one look at them beyond a second reveals them to be obnoxious people in even more obnoxious makeup.:::0:::2/4
Insidious clearly borrows from several sources, but where it fails as a narrative, it succeeds as a shock-a-minute fright fest with plenty of atmosphere and dread.:::1:::8/10
The ending struggles to explain too much and take itself a bit too literally, but mostly Insidious is an engaging treat.:::1:::2.5/4
It may be an essentially shallow ride, but it will make you scared of the dark again. It is a strangely comforting to be reminded of what that feels like.:::1:::4/5
There is much to recommend in this reunion of the creative forces behind the dazzling first Saw movie.:::1:::3/5
For all its creaky-old-dark-house cliches, Insidious is a fun ghost-train ride, full of truly terrifying moments. But once it's over, it's forgotten.:::1:::3
Director James Wan here proves himself very adept at building dramatic tension and making you anxious about the things going on in your peripheral vision.:::1:::3.5/5
Is this reminding you of anything? Like, say 77.2% of any horror movies ever made?:::0:::2.5/5
Insidious is certainly part of a great tradition of scary films, but it's a little too bland and visually unappealing to be memorable.:::0:::2.5/5
They're having such a joke on us because there is a ridiculous element to it and one of the things that I think they fall into the trap of showing too much. Horror and being scared is much more effective without actually seeing.:::0:::2.5/5
If the film was attempting to be more than just a horror movie, it doesn't work on that level either.:::0:::2/5
Insidious is very much a 21st century modern horror movie, which is to say it's more interested in tricks and scares than 'horror'.:::1:::3/5
Insidious is happy enough with elevating your breathing pattern every now and then, as opposed to choking you outright with one shock after another.:::1:::2.5/5
While the third act descends into silliness, for the most part this is a superbly crafted and genuinely scary flick that borrows brilliantly from horror classics.:::1:::None
It's intelligent, it's well-paced, it's packed with both unsettling scenes and pop-up shocks that never feel cheap.:::1:::4/5
For the majority of its running time Insidious is a scary good time at the movies.:::1:::None
This is a good ol' fashioned haunting, one with a tangible atmosphere, strong performances and plenty of skin-crawling scares.:::1:::4/5
Wan uses the lack of lighting, shaky camera and creepy music to keep us watching intently.:::1:::B
Insidious is quite scary and a lot of fun to go along with, as scare scenes are mixed up and played with in a way where I felt shortchanged with Sam Raimi's return-to-roots, Drag Me To Hell.:::1:::3/4
This is not the rollicking rollercoaster frightfest Paranormal Activity 1 and 2 were, nor is it a playful genre throwback like Drag Me To Hell, or even a touching family film like Poltergeist (which Insidious apes most).:::0:::2.5/5
Conjures up a nightmarish quality that I found difficult to shake off.:::1:::3/5
A haunting horror story at its core, but there are some decent flourishes with new ideas that make it worthwhile for fans of the genre:::1:::None
Insidious makes it fun to be scared. The scares are creepy rather than terrifying but they build up nicely and with some tongue-in-cheek:::1:::None
[S]cary, funny, thrilling, and deliciously meta all at the same...:::1:::None
The jump to more outre ghost-train-style horror is perhaps a tad blunt, but it remains scary enough to make it easy to buy into the supernatural ride it's intent on taking you on.:::1:::3/5
It's a case of tribute working to the top of its game. It's horror film trickery that immerses us, once again.:::1:::4.5/5
A supernatural horror flick by and for horror buffs.:::1:::None
A good thrill ride for younger audiences not familiar with the likes of Poltergiest or Wan's favourite 1991 TV movie The Haunted.:::1:::3/5
There are enough jolts, jumps and bursts of gallows humour along the way to recommend it to fans of scary movies.:::1:::None
For the most part it's standard stuff.:::0:::2/5
Insidious wouldn't scare a nervous dormouse.:::0:::None
Once the lights have come up you realise that behind the beautifully choreographed frights, there was very little going on.:::1:::3/5
Good for a handful of jumps and guilty giggles before it quickly reaches for the slipshod, hokey contrivances you don't expect until number 2 or 3 in the franchise.:::0:::2/5
Plays out in such a high, trilling key of baroque anxiety it's both jumpy and ludicrous.:::1:::3/5
Scared? You bet. Entertained? Totally ... baby monitors are definitely the scariest and most evil things ever invented.:::1:::4/5
The film reminded me of the first Poltergeist while simultaneously delivering some new language to the haunted house conversation...:::1:::4/5
The film is the work of director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell, who founded the Saw franchise. But Insidious, with its haunted house predictability, is pale stuff by comparison.:::0:::2/5
Derivative as it is, Insidious is competent enough, there are a few genuine scares and the final shock twist is an effective cinematic sucker-punch.:::1:::3/5
The tone is reminiscent of Sam Raimi's Drag Me to Hell, but this film is actually more spine-tingling.:::1:::3.5/5
Wan and Whannell have done wonders with a tiny budget and horror fans will enjoy being scared, but it's a shame that Insidious doesn't finish nearly as well as it starts.:::1:::3/5
Not so much insidious as inconsequential.:::0:::2/5
Derivative, uneven and frequently tedious, Insidious wastes a talented cast and is nowhere near as scary as it thinks it, though it does deliver a few cheap shocks, if you like that sort of thing.:::0:::2/5
The film never approaches being scary, but its colossal silliness makes it both intriguing and unpredictable.:::1:::3/5
Like the ghouls and ghosties confronted by its characters, Insidious overstays its welcome.:::0:::2.5/5
Not so much insidious as inexcusable.:::0:::2/5
When this unpretentious genre piece says boo, you'll jump all right - and it is canny enough in its management of the uncanny to have you laughing too.:::1:::None
A film that simply will not relent in its scares and surprises.:::1:::None
Saw creators Whannell and Wan return with a horror movie creepy enough to borrow under your skin.:::1:::3/5
A high-concept horror that oozes atmosphere and unease without relying on computer-generated effects or buckets of gore.:::1:::3.5/4.0
There's always some chump happy to claim that any given horror film was so scary they were "whimpering in sheer terror". Difference with Insidious is, the damn thing's so scary I actually WAS whimpering in sheer terror.:::1:::5/5
Promising and, in places, highly effective, this haunted-house variant more than fulfils its Friday Night fright flick duties but could have pushed through to a whole new plane.:::1:::3/5
Just when Insidious is starting to look slightly less scary than a winter gas bill, Wan and Whannell manage to reapply some intensity to the story.:::1:::3/5
Like a campfire story told well, it understands that the basic ability to catch you off guard is more effective than a lot of unnecessary flourishes.:::1:::3/4
Yes, the 'Saw' guys can scare the daylights out of you even with a PG-13 rating. Director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell made the original 'Saw' movie.:::1:::3
... efficient, imaginative and effective ...:::1:::3/5
Insidious is old-fashioned in the best sense.:::1:::B
A well-orchestrated mix of foreboding atmosphere, discordant music, and visual freak-outs:::1:::3/4
Possession and astral travel combine for some neck-popping good fun.:::1:::8/10
Wan and Whannell have, in effect, ripped pages from the "Poltergeist" playbook and stripped the formulas down to old-style gothic scares.:::1:::None
The delicious kind of creepy that makes for a great night at the movies if you're into that sort of thing.:::1:::7/10
Director Wan and writer Whannell keeps things quiet at first, the creepy kind of quiet where the ticking of a clock creates an unbearably tantalizing tension.:::1:::4/5
A cute old-fashioned frightfest.:::1:::3.0/4.0
Invariably puts some quirky personal spin on the things it borrows, in turn creating one of the most enjoyably eccentric horror movies in quite some time.:::1:::4/5
Scary enough to be fun but not scary enough to gross you out - and there is a difference!:::1:::6/10
The demons in Insidious, or malefic spirits, or whatever they are, could be whipped up in a couple of hours in time for a Halloween party. In a way, that's kind of cool.:::1:::3/5
Keep that in mind, horror directors and screenwriters: nothing kills terror better than a pair of indie-rock-Mormon-missionary-looking ghostbusters.:::0:::2.5/5
It's not scary, it's just surprising and surprise is not the same thing as horror.:::0:::None
If there's a complaint to be made about Insidious, it's that the film's second half is unable to live up to the impossibly high standards set by the first half.:::1:::3/4
For scares alone, "Insidious" deserves an "A." It may not be very original, but for a fun trip through a haunted house, it works exceedingly well.:::1:::B+
Relying on familiar devices like startling sounds, ominously opening doors and incomprehensible mumbo-jumbo about astral-projection and demonic possession, it's a deja-'boo,' a waste of time and money.:::0:::2/10
While it's probably time to call for a moratorium on both haunted-house thrillers and creepy-child sagas, Insidious milks a bit of innovativeness from both these sub-genres before self-destructing.:::1:::2.5/4
Wan knows that what we're paying for is to be scared deep in our bones, and that images glimpsed and hinted at are orders of magnitude more unsettling than buckets of blood and viscera.:::1:::7.9/10
Insidious is actually not a bad horror movie (that's probably because it's not much more than Poltergeist with fewer killer trees).:::1:::2.5/5
Insidious is a haunted house story. In some ways it's smarter than most.:::1:::3/5
Insidious isn't scary. It's laughable. And kind of sad.:::0:::D+
At its foundation, it's a movie I like. It's what's built on that foundation that's troubling.:::0:::2.5/5
Saw creators James Wan and Leigh Whannell take a crack at an old-fashioned ghost story, and the results are pretty creepy: ominous shadows, strange noises and glimpses of freaky things flitting through the dark.:::1:::None
Essentially, it's a retread of Poltergeist, about a haunted house that more or less "kidnaps" a child, but it has its own unique spin. It's an old tale told in a new way.:::1:::4/5
Don't even get me started on the sublime asininity of the cloven-hoofed, fire-faced demon thingee that, for no reason I can fathom, resembles, almost exactly, Darth Maul. Seriously. Don't.:::0:::0/5
It's a horror show all right. Stilted line readings creep hand-in-demonic claw with pacing that could induce rigor. If only Mrs. Gas Mask Psychic could have warned us in advance ...:::0:::2/10
For one loopy moment, when the trilly sound of 'Tiptoe Through the Tulips' mysteriously wafts through the spook-plagued California home, it seems as if the story's unfortunate family is being haunted by the ghosts of Tiny Tim and his ukulele.:::1:::3/4
James Wan knows his horror tricks -- even though "Insidious" has just a PG-13 rating, there were people jumping out of seats all through the auditorium.:::1:::3/4
James Wan's Insidious is both an apology for the numbing 'Saw' sequels and proof old-school horror still rocks.:::1:::3/4
To director James Wan's credit, Insidious is really creepy. Not good. But creepy.:::0:::2/5
The film delivers haunted house-type scares throughout but I just wish the second half was as good as the first. Wait for the flick to come out on DVD.:::1:::2.5
There's little new here. And what is new isn't well done.:::0:::1.5/4
Insidious is a crashing bore, and will likely only frighten people who have never seen any horror movies.:::0:::1/5
'Insidious' benefits from being buoyed by its first hour or so. Overall a better watch than teentalk advance publicity would lead one to expect.:::1:::None
[Insidious] has been made so skillfully that even those not normally disposed to such things may well find it an engrossing night at the movies.:::1:::4/5
The tension is nicely handled in the first half, but once it's time to start paying off with proper horror, Wan falls back on the same imagery he always uses.:::0:::2/5
Nothing slows down a movie down like people sitting around a living room discussing the meaning of "astral projection.":::0:::2/4
Insidious feels like a traditional, old fashioned horror movie in all of the right ways.:::1:::2.5/4
The movie is called "Insidious," but "Insipidious" would be more appropriate.:::0:::1/4
A poor man's Poltergeist.:::0:::1.5/4
"Insidious" establishes that these folks can make a film that operates on an entirely different level, sans gore, or obvious gimmicks. And make flesh crawl.:::1:::None
When a pair of goofy (and unamusing) ghostbusters and their medium boss (Lin Shaye) show up, Insidious takes a tragic turn toward the stupid.:::0:::C-
The most the James Wan film has is ear-piercing sound effects with quick cuts to scary faces. Of course you'll jump, but you'll also jump if someone runs behind you and screams in your eardrum -- this is the same effect as 'Insidious.':::0:::D
It's the haunted house that cliche built.:::0:::1.5/4
The strongest analogue for the second half of "Insidious" is one that the filmmakers probably weren't trying for: it feels like a less poetic version of an M. Night Shyamalan fairy tale.:::0:::2.5/5
Tiny Tim's legacy might not have been to terrify the living hell out of people, but that is what it will be once this movie gets done with him.:::1:::3/4
It's too much "Saw" and not enough "Paranormal.":::0:::1.5/4
From the opening credits, in which the title appears in blood-red letters to the accompaniment of blaring, dissonant music, the movie tries to get under your skin and inside your mind. Sometimes it does.:::0:::2/4
There's not much that's insidious, or subtle, here. A prolonged scene involving an unnerving high-pitched burglar alarm does get under our skin. But it's far more annoying than frightening.:::0:::2/4
Until the misguided last act, 'Insidious' manages to generate some genuine chills and a few chuckles...Unlike the best horror films, though, it probably won't stick with you long after the lights come up.:::1:::B-
There are enough quality scares and inspired jolts to keep the most passionate horror buffs screaming happily.:::1:::3/4
The film is weighed down by too many forehead-palming lapses and an overall sense of "been there.":::0:::2/4
Here's a better-than-average spook house movie, mostly because Insidious decides it can haunt an audience without spraying it with blood.:::1:::2.5/4
The final shocker succeeds in shocking, and does so sans gore. But first we have to wade through a red door and a red hallway, pleas to "follow my voice,'' and an infinity of fog about as scary as dry ice vapor spilling onto a dance floor.:::0:::1.5/4
All calculation aside, scary is still scary, and Insidious makes up in old-fashioned tension what it sometimes lacks in originality.:::1:::B
The film begins well, bridges the middle with a comically creepy set piece, then goes to hell in a hand basket with a poorly conceived climax that serves no scares.:::0:::C+
Not terrifically good, but moviegoers will get what they're expecting.:::0:::2.5/4
If your idea of a fun night out is to be manipulated by freaky sound effects, jumpy edits, and point-of-view shots of ceiling fans whooshing menacingly, Insidious is the film for you.:::1:::2.5/4
If the audience I watched this with is any indication, laughter will be drowning out the creaks, atonal chords, and snatches of Tiny Tim's "Tiptoe through the Tulips" that are meant to scare you on the soundtrack.:::0:::1.5/4
It gets a little baroque in the final reel, but "Insidious" stays disciplined - the horror derives from the way the demon tests the strength of maternal/paternal bonds.:::1:::B
more a humdinger of a missed opportunity than a total disaster.:::0:::1.5/4
Wan feels torn between telling a scary story and making a "scary" movie, and the viewer is ultimately stranded between the two impulses.:::1:::6/10
builds legitimate haunted-house dread ... [but] at a very specific point ... possession turns jokey and hokey.:::1:::3/5
Save for "Two Girls and One Cup," I'm able to sit through anything. Very little bothers me the way "Insidious" bothered me. Disturbed me. Ran its ice-cold finger down the length of my spine, chilling me to the core.:::1:::3.5/4
Aesthetically, Insidious operates at the level of a decent high school video project.:::0:::1/4
Mixing POLTERGEIST with Disney's Haunted Mansion ride, a staggeringly disappointing and silly second half mars INSIDIOUS' strong, scary first half.:::1:::None
The film is stylish and quietly unsettling even in its derivativeness, and it delivers the sort of slow-building chills that ruffle the hair at the back of your neck, at least until the frights get a little too literal, in the movie's third act.:::1:::2.5/4
Director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell admire all sorts of fright, from the blatant to the insidiously subtle. This one lies at an effective halfway point between those extremes.:::1:::3/4
Horror movies haven't been this fun in a very long time:::1:::4.5/5
If you've never seen a thriller involving eerie images of mysterious kids, creepy old people, creaky doors or demons in the window, now you can find them all in one place.:::0:::2/4
Wan and Whannell have come a long way since Saw, but they still have a little further to go.:::0:::2.5/5
Strong, extraordinarily disciplined horror flick. No cheap scares here.:::1:::8/10
It turns out to be a moderately effective suburban-family creep show, majorly in debt to "Poltergeist" and "The Exorcist" and capturing at least a little of their spirit.:::1:::None
Wan actually makes an appealing ruckus with Insidious, a derivative but effective scare machine pulled off with a certain gusto, making the viewing experience a treat for those who enjoy their shock jump cinema.:::1:::B
Insidious is a haunted-house movie that has some of the most shivery and indelible images I've seen in any horror film in decades.:::1:::A-
The actors are commended for keeping straight faces throughout, with Wilson and Shaye going beyond the call of authenticity. It isn't easy to wear that gas mask or feign a twitching trance without appearing foolish, but they don't.:::1:::B
The film's low-budget atmospherics and cliched floor-creakings are a poor substitute for Wan's nauseating impact of yore.:::0:::2/5
No blood, no gore, no hacked-off arms and legs, but plenty of creepy set pieces, quick cuts and blasts of music that will have you both squirming in your seat and jumping out of it.:::1:::3.5/5
Its plot, ripped off from The Amityville Horror, shows so little psychological or occult logic that it exposes its own sheer dumbness as just a series of spookings.:::0:::None
Insidious is the kind of movie you could watch with your eyes closed and still feel engrossed by it.:::1:::None
It doesn't build a better haunted house but, when on its game, reminds us of the genre's pleasures.:::1:::None
A possession thriller less terrifying than fun.:::1:::None
A surprising number of Let's describe Neil Burger's latest as director "Abraham Polonsky's 'The Matrix.'" It's a hyper-local amped-up Manhattan melodrama that pulses through one man's mind, one user's bloodstream.:::1:::None
Paradoxically absorbing, yet cliched and empty, this power-based New York story is a bit of an entertaining thrill ride, probably far more popcorn-engrossing than it deserves to be...:::1:::C+
Limitless brings the seduction of self-enhancement to your local cineplex in a witty package that's pretty enough to keep you intrigued:::1:::8/10
Relationships are shortchanged and this brisk, fantastical tale fails to find any emotional traction.:::1:::2.5/4
While it does have some entertaining moments and other moments where possibilities rear their heads, it never quite lives up to the premise.:::0:::2.5/4
An enjoyable film that tries to move beyond the standard thriller.:::1:::7/10
For a movie about hyper-intelligent human beings, Limitless is surprisingly sloppy and ultimately rather brainless.:::0:::4/10
Despite some snazzy camera angles and showoff-y technique, Limitless dashes any hopes of originality when it ends up being nothing more than a cautionary tale about drug addiction:::0:::1.5/4
not just a cool film to watch, but a cool film to see:::1:::4/5
Bradley Cooper is his usual innocuous but personality-free, walking wallpaper self and hence not up to the challenge.:::0:::2.5/4
To see the two leads face off verbally is a treat...:::1:::4/5
There are highs, and it may be fun for a while, but in the end it's a thudding, relentless road to nowhere.:::0:::2/5
Burger plunges into the material at such a headlong pace and with sufficient adrenalized style as to propel this essentially trashy thriller and distract from the abundant loose ends. [Blu-ray]:::1:::2.5/4
While it's not that the film-makers do an amazingly stunning job with the idea, it's perhaps more that they don't fumble it at all.:::1:::3/5
It's not the science that's important, it's the momentum, the conceptual journey, the dynamism of the head games and chemically-enhanced battle of wits...:::1:::None
One complaint you cannot level at Limitless is that it is unoriginal or uncreative. In an upcoming summer of senseless sequels and repugnant remakes, Limitless-warts and all-is at least something we've never seen before.:::1:::7/10
Begins like an update of Roger Corman's 'X - The Man with the X-Ray Eyes' but abandons its probe of the soul-sucking price of power addiction to pander to the idea that audiences demand slick fantasy-role-model heroes and happy endings.:::0:::2.5/4
Dubious values and undercooked philosophy aside, Limitless is an engaging and often good-humoured trip that moves at quite a lick and benefits from being directed with some flair.:::1:::None
Is Limitless a science fiction movie?:::1:::None
A fun, stylistic flick that seems like something Slumdog Millionaire director Danny Boyle would do if he wanted to make a D.A.R.E. commercial.:::1:::3/5
A fun romp in this cautionary tale that glides by relying heavily on star Bradley Cooper's charisma.:::1:::B
... a humdinger of a science fiction thriller that scoots easily from shaggy-dog fable to noir mystery to conspiracy thriller and winds up on the dark side of Twilight Zone.:::1:::3.5/4
Moves so fast you don't have time to think:::1:::None
Fine cast and premise sullied by soulless handling. Frustratingly limited in its power to entertain and engross.:::0:::2/5
A bracing story that examines what intelligence will and will not buy and what is the effect that such a drug would have on society:::1:::7/10
...a fascinating thriller with fine pace that never lets up.:::1:::9/10
I think they're trying to trade on Cooper's handsome mug when what they should be emphasizing is the tight, weird, unpredictable evil-cat-and-equally-evil-mouse angle. But no matter why you go see it, you won't have a bad time.:::1:::3/5
Based on a novel by Alan Glynn, Leslie Dixon's intelligent screenplay moves along at a brisk pace.:::1:::4/5
A movie that gets a lot of mileage out of good old-fashioned wish fulfillment. Consistently entertaining.:::1:::3/4
Part fantasy fulfillment, part paranoid thriller, this is a subversive Faustian tale.:::1:::6/10
Limitless fails to reach its potential.:::0:::2.5/4.0
[An] ingenious, extremely violent thriller...:::1:::None
Despite some illogical plot turns it's a Hollywood film that for once refuses to get moralistic about its vacuous premise...:::1:::3/5
A flashy techno-thriller.:::1:::B-
You almost feel yourself getting smarter as you watch. Remember how you felt sitting through Transformers 2? Kind of the opposite of that.:::1:::4/5
Like a fast-food shake, the film tastes vaguely metallic and predominately of something approximating vanilla... sometimes you've just gotta satisfy your cravings.:::1:::6/10
...a watchable yet far-from-engrossing high-finance thriller.:::1:::2.5/4
It's a little like the question posed by the classic 'Flowers for Algernon': What would happen to a person who suddenly became brilliant?:::1:::3/4
A neo-noir sci-fi chase thriller with pharmaceutical tendencies. Fun stuff.:::1:::4/5
Limitless may not pass a demanding test of logic. But Hitchcock once told me, "logic is dull." Limitless is certainly not dull.:::1:::3.0/5
... a potent parable about the risks of playing with fire.:::1:::4/5
Too bad Leslie Dixon tapped less than 20 percent of hers while penning her underdeveloped script.:::0:::2.5/4
Burger does a dazzling job of conveying Eddie's supercharged mental capacity - when Eddie's pepped-up on NZT the images really zing.:::1:::None
The plot is utter tosh but executed with such flamboyant style that you might think it was Shakespeare. Or not.:::0:::None
Perhaps a better title would be Limited.:::0:::5/10
A flawed but entertaining sci-fi thriller...:::1:::3/5
Good, if limited.:::1:::3/5
The escalation of greed is a major factor in the film, and the unsettling aspiration of always wanting more - the ugly side of the American Dream - is rife.:::1:::4/5
What's fresh about this concept is how it turns perfect intelligence into a superpower and tries to imagine its real-world applications. What's less fresh is the ensuing plot...:::1:::3/5
You could pick the script apart for impossibilities. But why bother? It's much more enjoyable to shut your brain off and have a good time.:::1:::None
Eventually, there are huge gaps in logic that make the movie seem really stupid.:::0:::2/4
You'll definitely regret it in the morning, and wonder what the hell you were thinking, but as hedonistic cinema trips go, Limitless's power to entertain - while it might not live up to its title - just about extends to its 105 minute running time.:::1:::3/5
Director Neil Burger uses trippy, vertigo-inducing sequences to put us inside Eddie's head and there's a quick-cutting pace that would leave many recent thrillers standing in the dust.:::1:::3.5/5
It's involving and entertaining, and sometimes even thought-provoking. And it gives Cooper a role that perfectly uses his skills as an actor.:::1:::4/5
Directed by Neil Burger (The Illusionist), Limitless works best with some high-powered visual sequences which heighten our own senses.:::1:::3/5
It's more Jan de Bont than Christopher Nolan, but when the ride is this exhilarating, sometimes the destination just doesn't matter.:::1:::3/5
Bored? Lack of wish-fulfilment in your life? Take Limitless for quick, over-the-counter relief.:::1:::3/5
Hugely enjoyable thriller with a sharply written script, pacey direction and a terrific central performance from Bradley Cooper.:::1:::4/5
It's scatty and fast paced, and director Neil Burger employs some Gaspar Noe-style, bad-trip CG effects to heighten the mood.:::1:::4/5
Bradley Cooper becomes a star with this film. He stands toe to toe with De Niro and never blinks.:::1:::7/10
Ironically for a film so keenly centred on the idea of reaching one's own potential, Limitless doesn't nearly begin to realise its own.:::0:::2.5/5
While this film fails to break the typical Hollywood mold, it is still entertaining enough in a wish fulfillment fantasy kind of way.:::1:::B
A loopy joy from start to finish, Bradley Cooper proves that he's the real deal.:::1:::4/5
Very limited, actually.:::0:::None
"Limitless" is the perfect way to kick of Spring with a highly addictive motion picture that has you wondering would you try NZT?:::1:::3/5
Cooper proves to be a leading man in this sleek thriller about addiction, drive and the American dream.:::1:::8/10
"Limitless" delivers the goods in terms of fun, suspense, and an above-average story. The twists and turns never appear without reason, and Cooper delivers an assured, charismatic performance that lifts the film.:::1:::B
"Limitless" really just wants you to go with the flow of the id over ego. In the end, it's a passable, darkly comic pharmacological mystery with visual panache that plays fast and loose, but never boringly, with the "pharma" and the "logical.":::1:::2.5/4
The cinematic equivalent of a meal high in calories and low in nutrition...dresses up a weak narrative in a glitzy explosion of technical virtuosity intended to conceal its shortcomings.:::0:::C+
An energetic fantasy, both cerebral and physical, with Bradley Cooper playing the charming lead.:::1:::B+
Don't believe the abs... I mean the ads, Bradley Cooper is mostly dressed in his latest film Limitless.:::0:::None
[VIDEO] "Limitless" isn't a perfect sci-fi thriller. But it gives you a fleeting sense of what it might be like to really be the smartest person in the world.:::1:::B
The philosophical ramifications of becoming the most intelligent man on Earth are either too complex or hold too little appeal, with the peeks into Eddie's beautiful mind conveyed through saturated color schemes and letters tumbling down from the rafters.:::0:::2.5/4

We've seen this idea before, but they did play around with it...so you're not sitting there the entire time: 'I feel like I've taken the drug when it comes to this plot.' No.:::1:::3.5/5
one wishes that the film had been more daring in its exploration of what such a situation might entail, questioning rather than reveling in the flashy surfaces of wealth and power:::0:::2.5/4
The hallucinatory movie gets credit for bringing up the issue of untapped human potential. The movie's "what if" wish-fulfillment fantasy theme ultimately falters, runs out of steam and breaks down with an ending that is well beyond belief.:::1:::2.5/4
One has to wonder, would you take NZT if you had the opportunity?:::1:::None
We've all seen that beer commercial featuring "the most interesting man in the world". Move over, pal --- you've got competition.:::1:::None
Cooper has to prove convincingly pathetic, then motivated, then desperate to his audience, and he's ideally cast in his first major leading role as something of a modern-day Icarus.:::1:::None
With his pin-up looks and ineffable lack of gradation, Bradley Cooper is a compelling anchor for this sort of material -- you're both rooting for him and weirdly hoping for a bit of dark comeuppance, which makes for some intriguing tension.:::1:::3/5
What would you do if you could take a pill and suddenly access 100 percent of your brain power? This is the premise behind Limitless, a sci-fi thriller that looks as if its makers utilized around 30 percent of theirs.:::0:::C
While so many films have already taken us down this rabbit hole, "Limitless" will be remembered for forgetting to make us care we've fallen down it the second we leave the theater.:::0:::2.0/5.0
On one level Limitless something of a conventional thriller ... [o]n another it's a tale of high finance hijinks and intrigue ... [a]nd on yet another level it's something of a traditional gangster film. It's just all over the place.:::0:::5/10
The filmmakers doesn't sweat the fact that Eddie is a chemically enhanced fraud. What scares them is any possibility of alienating the movie's target audience with a downer ending.:::0:::None
It's a lot of fun to watch, turning slowly as it does from the initial glee of discovery to the inevitable addiction issues and a transformation into a dark, suspense-fuelled drama.:::1:::4/5
Limitless is fairly smart, and smart films are few and far between.:::1:::B
Add it all up, including the nifty twist at the end, and what we have here is a fun Hollywood flick with a good head on its shoulders.:::1:::3.5/4
'Limitless' is a fast moving, fantasy fun ride and full of thrills. Cooper, with a winning charisma, makes the film interesting to watch.:::1:::3/4
Limitless is limited, but intriguing nonetheless.:::1:::B
Limitless may not be as brainy as it would like to think it is, but it's a relatively sharp and surprisingly playful head-trip, a satisfyingly novel twist on mindless entertainment.:::1:::None
...all flash and sizzle, but still delivers; it's equal parts superhero wish fulfillment and cautionary yuppie satire, and it's also a hell of a fun ride.:::1:::B+
If you want a movie with a sermon, well, look somewhere else. But if you want an adrenaline shot to the heart, look here.:::1:::3.5/4
Limitless is frustrating, in part, because it could have been much better.:::0:::None
In a way, the movie is as involving and addictive as the fictitious drug it conjures up.:::1:::3/5
Occasionally skirts greatness and is definitely worth your time. But it could have been much more.:::1:::3.5/5
Limitless is the sort of B-movie Roger Corman would make 50 years ago, riffing on a studio smash like Inception without the lofty budget or ideas.:::1:::B+
As if we, too, had taken some drug, it's not until we shrug off the visual effects of the film that we realize that the plot is rather silly. But holy hallucinogens, that eye candy can't be beat.:::1:::6/10
Starts off as an ambitious, gripping, quasi-sci-fi thriller and turns into an over-the-top mess. But it's never dull, and looking at Bradley Cooper is never bad.:::1:::None
Cooper's performance coupled with Bruger's stylized directing puts even the out of place ending firmly into a comfortable pocket of enjoyability.:::1:::None
Limitless hits you like an adrenaline rush that will have you saying, "I'll have what he's having.":::1:::3/4
it is just one big drug itself that when taken emboldens you with the power to see that Bradley Cooper should not be headlining a film, Leslie Dixon should not be writing it and Neil Burger must never be allowed to helm a major motion picture again.:::0:::1/4
Cooper, whose eyes are startlingly blue here, holds the screen.:::1:::B
The keys here are momentum and visual effects: effects to let you see what Eddie is feeling, momentum so you don't have too much time to think about what you're seeing.:::1:::None
Limitless is a deliriously loopy thrill-ride but all the better for it.:::1:::3/5
Thought provoking and with New York brought to life flash intellige by flashy camerawork, Limitless is cool, funny and intelligent.:::1:::4/5
This premise offers a lot of opportunities for straight popcorn fun, and the director seizes every one of them.:::1:::None
"Limitless" is a heck of a ride. On the way to its unpredictable (if less than wholly satisfying) conclusion, it is entertaining, a little silly and visually dazzling.:::1:::2.5/4
"Limitless" may please a few looking for a shallow fantasy thriller, but won't fire up the synapses of the intellectually demanding.:::0:::2/4
Burger and Dixon provide the dangerous downward spiral that consumes Eddie, but it wouldn't work without Cooper.:::1:::2.5/4
A mess. Starts off great, but ruined by a ridiculous second half. There may be a good movie on a cutting room floor somewhere, but this ain't it.:::0:::4/10
Not only does it fail to come across as the smart entertainment that it wishes that it was, you can actually feel it killing your brain cells as it goes on and on:::0:::2/5
The pill hits him like a combination of Ritalin, steroids, speed, and super-powerful ginkgo biloba, like spinach hits Popeye, if it grew his brain instead of his muscles.:::1:::B+
Burger's stylishly directed film makes up for any narrative hiccups with a mix of wry humor and comic-book-inspired visual flourishes.:::1:::2.5/4
If you're willing to ignore the many leaps in logic, his fast-paced thriller goes down easy enough with a side of popcorn.:::1:::3/5
It's a movie that knows its limits and works pretty well within them.:::1:::3/4
If there were a pill that made people smarter, I'd donate an extra supply to the creators of "Limitless.":::0:::2/4
"Limitless" only uses 15, maybe 20 percent of its brain. Still, that's more than a lot of movies do.:::0:::2.5/4
It's well made, filled with interesting ideas, and just odd enough so that it'll once again prevent Neil Burger from becoming a Hollywood darling.:::1:::3/5
It's like watching The Fonz get free songs by punching a jukebox, and that never stops being fun.:::1:::3/5
What's the fun in worrying about losing your soul when you can gain the world?:::0:::2/4
Smart and sharp. Great concept soon to be a reality.:::1:::None
There are certain actors who you can just look at and instantly fall in love with. Tom Hanks is one. Drew Barrymore is another. Bradley Cooper is not.:::0:::1.5/4
The ending has loads of leverage, and the film has plenty of moxie. Nice ride!:::1:::4/5
Cornish develops her character more in one scene than Cooper does in the whole movie.:::1:::B
An energetic, enjoyably preposterous compound - it's a paranoid thriller blended with pseudo-neuro-science fiction and catalyzed by a jolting dose of satire - directed by Neil Burger.:::1:::3.5/5
A strangely arid experience, without the gleeful, drugged-out weirdness of a truly offbeat endeavor.:::0:::2/4
Better living through chemistry is a debatable notion satirically explored in this briskly paced, suspenseful thriller.:::1:::3/4
If you're jonesing for an addictive thriller, Limitless goes down easily and creates a contact high with zippy pacing and hypnotic visuals.:::1:::B+
Limitless riffs boundlessly on what it means to be creative and how chemical stimulation (speed, booze, whatever) can tamp and temper the willpower necessary to achieve greatness. It's all fun and games until you start seeing stalker.:::0:::2.5/5
Limitless is the kind of slick trash that upstart distributors often embrace as a stepping stone to the sort of clumsily reckless trash at which big studios uniquely excel.:::0:::2/5
Without much fanfare Neil Burger has emerged as one of the best suspense directors in the business.:::1:::None
Limitless is an amusing, clever tale of self-actualization run amok. It's also a surprisingly effective hybrid of comedy, drama and action.:::1:::4.5/5
The visuals are giddy, illustrating Eddie's high with fun house lenses, over-exposed colors, supersonic edits -- and, when side effects kick in, dizzying flights through the streets of New York.:::1:::2.5/4
Despite the presence of De Niro and Cornish, Limitless is pretty much a one-man show. Happily, Cooper is up to it. Limitless may not be a slam dunk, but this guy's got it.:::1:::2.5/4
Certainly there are a few times "Limitless" teeters on interesting possibilities, but it has a weird way of pulling back on its most stimulating ideas.:::0:::2/4
It would be curious to see the four or five endings the makers of Limitless came up with before they settled for this one, which is smeared with the fingerprints of test audiences and focus groups.:::1:::3/5
"Limitless" misfires on any number of points; it's not a particularly smart or imaginative yarn.:::0:::2/4
The disappointment is that for all of the possibilities, "Limitless" never gets beyond "limited.":::0:::2/5
Limitless rocks.:::1:::3.5/4
As a power trip geared to young males, the movie's kick is as strong as anything in "The Social Network" with the bonus of glamorous Cooper in the lead.:::1:::B
Limitless' highs are sustained and visually snappy, a David Fincher-esque vision of New York conquered. But the side effects are a little troubling.:::1:::B
The movie is too chaotic to be very good. But it's fun and not stupid, which is something.:::1:::2.5/4
Gripping thriller about the heady and nightmarish journey of a struggling writer who becomes a kind of tortured uber-mensch after he takes an unapproved wonder drug, starring Bradley Cooper in a breakthrough performance.:::1:::None
For a plot about super-intelligent people, the screenplay is surprisingly dumb.:::0:::2.5/4
Overall it's smart entertainment that even manages to make Robert De Niro, Cooper's co-star, sound fully engaged.:::1:::2.5/4
nothing new, but it's told in a completely captivating way.:::1:::4/5
The problem with "Limitless," other than its lack of Muppets, is a charismatic but unappealing protagonist.:::0:::2/4
It feels vapid, even when it's trying to persuade us of the nefarious significance of NZT, in large part because the screenplay is so indecisive about the impact of the drug.:::0:::None
A nice surprise on the acting front for Limitless is that it coughs up the first half-decent role Robert De Niro has had for several years:::1:::3.5/5
It's a fanciful story and quite a good one. I enjoyed it and I thought Bradley Cooper was much better than he'd been in things I'd seen him in before.:::1:::3.5/5
[An] erratic but often wickedly sly thriller.:::1:::3/5
The secret to making a great, or even just a good, thriller these days seems to have been lost. Maybe the key is not so much feeling invincible as knowing what your limits are.:::0:::5.5/10
[C]learly was not written by someone taking this best-you-can-be pill... It's not awful. It's passably entertaining. But it thinks it's taking risks yet never goes out on any ledges.:::0:::None
Like any drug, Limitless starts out as something refreshing and stimulating but when you come down you're stuck wondering where the last few hours went.:::0:::2/5
Frenetic thriller about a drug that unleashes your brain's full potential doesn't quite achieve its own, but star Bradley Cooper and director Neil Burger make the most of it.:::1:::3/4
Cooper's an able light comic performer as well as a shrewd dramatic actor, and "Limitless" lets him run considerable distances in both directions.:::1:::None
Limitless has an intriguing concept - and while it's not explored as deeply as it could have been, the film still delivers a satisfying ride.:::1:::3.5/5
There is some irony in Burger's attempts to dumb down a film about hyper intelligence, but it's not an act of cleverness. It's closer to fumbled filmmaking, cruelly corrupting the itchy high Limitless once handled so superbly.:::0:::C-
This movie's veneer of knowing slickness is more than canceled out by a thick, fatty layer of stupidity.:::0:::None
If this guy were really in command of all his previous experiences, he'd know better than to take out a loan from a generic Russian goon. Does that ever turn out well?:::0:::2/4
Punchy and witty entertainment with an adept balance of adrenaline rush and clear-eyed sobriety.:::1:::4/5
For all its peripatetic energy, Limitless still winds up with the same-old blazing guns and wanton destruction of property. No matter how smart you may be, Hollywood will figure out a way to dumb you down.:::1:::2/4
Is the fact that Cooper becomes a high-yield stock broker who likes to sleep with models supposed to mean that he's misusing his powers, or that screenwriter Leslie Dixon thinks this is the goal of every person on Earth?:::0:::None
Even Bradley Cooper lapping thirstily at a pool of blood can't save a dumbass sci-fi fable on the perils of increased mental capacity.:::0:::1/4
Limitless delivers some pleasurable punch -- and rarely makes you feel small.:::1:::3/5
Timing is everything and, in this case, the moral repercussions of this drug-crazed sci-fi-er ring are especially reprehensible.:::0:::None
Alternate-reality thriller isn't as smart as it thinks.:::0:::3/5
Some of its conceits may not hold up under intense scrutiny, but, generally speaking, it's a good time at the movies.:::1:::4/5
Limitless just wants to give you a good time, and it does, yet the film leaves you wondering: Now that our world has been saturated with antidepressants, is this where big pharma strikes next?:::1:::B+
It's very well directed. The ending may be a little pat, but the journey is a trip.:::1:::4/5
An intriguing premise can't disguise the standard action thriller plotting that leaves Limitless a little too limited in its scopthese gotcha moments have the desired effect, and the picture's first hour strings them along through a familiar tale.:::1:::None
James Wan's most effective film as a director and one of the scariest and creepiest movies in some time.:::1:::8.5/10
If Polgergeist is the Disneyland Mansion of spookhouse movies, Insidious is a small-town Haunted Hayride, filled with low-fi jumps and punctuated with giggles.:::1:::7/10
Wan strikes just the right notes of ever-building suspense as he establishes the trouble that befalls the Lamberts, but when Elise and her team enter the picture, Insidious goes off the rails.:::1:::3/5
By the time the absurdly deflating finale rolls around, Wan has managed to not only botch his own film, but sully the one cool element of Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace as well.:::0:::C
Yet another been-there-done-that horror pic.:::0:::C
The kind of bold, high quality horror film genre fans deserve but rarely receive.:::1:::4/5
The film, a collaboration of the makers of Saw and Paranormal Activity, is uneven: first half, which evokes Poltergeist, is really scary and spooky, but second is nonsensical and too reliant on technology.:::1:::B-
The thing is scary as hell when it's all creaks and thumps and doors swinging open. Then come the explanations, the special effects, and the inevitable feeling of been-there-been-bombarded-by-that.:::0:::None
Genuinely scary in some parts, downright silly in others, and undeniably entertaining as a whole, Insidious is both a tribute and solid entry in the ever expanding demonic possession sub-genre.:::1:::3.5/5
Less film than funhouse ride, but it's a frequently scary funhouse ride that presents itself as such.:::1:::2.5/4
"Insidious" has a few good shock surprises accompanied by jolting music, but it doesn't have what it takes to sustain any real terror.:::0:::C
Whatever flaws it may have, Insidious scared the hell out of me.:::1:::B+
Its descent into gimmicky bollocks is quick and unrelenting.:::0:::None
A creepy and atmospheric supernatural horror tale that plays a lot like a modern day  Poltergeist with a decidedly retro aesthetic.:::1:::3.5/5
A solid horror movie.:::1:::B
Looking up the word Insidious in the dictionary is a more fulfilling experience than seeing the movie Insidious.:::0:::D
Undoubtedly James Wan's best movie since 2004's Saw...:::1:::3/4
This is no trifle aimed at undiscerning teenagers on a slow weekend. It is ruthlessly calculated to scare the bejeezus out of you.:::1:::B+
A really mature, perceptive view of the supernatural. Leigh Whannell's script incorporates spiritual powers and philosophy... a new vision of the world beyond our own.:::1:::None
A love letter to [director] James Wan's favorite movie, Poltergeist, this spooky story follows a young couple and their children into a new home... and into the pit of darkness when an evil presence makes its insidious intentions known.:::1:::None

e.:::0:::2.5/5
Directed with a pulsating fervor by Neil Burger, Limitless is absurd but entertaining action-adventure escapism.:::0:::2/4
A clean-cut piece of entertainment that delivers an invigorating and engaging high with no nasty side effects.:::1:::4/5
Not really a horror film (blood-slurping notwithstanding), Limitless is more a suspense-thriller that should appeal to fans of tension and adrenaline.:::1:::None
Without a complex thought about narcissism, merit, or addiction, Limitless is content to be an empty, one-note, satire-free fairy tale of avarice and corporate-political ambition.:::0:::None
If you have any moral qualms about checking out a film where about 60% of the suspense comes from a junkie trying to hide or retrieve his stash, this isn't the film for you.:::1:::3.5/5
...even as we're dragged along by its brisk pacing and occasionally smart twists, there's a nagging feeling a better film's in here waiting to be made.:::1:::3/5
Burger fails in creating the paranoia infused techno morality tale he so wanted to make, with themes such as the consequences of powers given and not earned, and the destructive nature of addiction, failing to relate on an emotional and even moral level.:::0:::None
Limitless should be so much smarter than it is.:::0:::None
[A] propulsive, unexpectedly funny thriller.:::1:::None
Featuring a charismatic leading man and interesting premise, Limitless is a viscerally appealing sci-fi thriller yet fails to tap into its vast potential.:::0:::2.5/5
Director Neil Burger flaunts flair, with bursts of stylised Escher-esque camerawork (dig those speeding super-zooms), saturated colour and a euphoric soundtrack.:::1:::3/5
The opposite of Alzheimer's, as unsavory characters compete to snatch up an egghead performance enhancer turning slackers into spontaneous geniuses. The director may not be dropping NZT, but his finger is on the pulse of a vividly realized contact high.:::1:::None
It's a gee-whizz novelty movie along the lines of Inception, with great effects and some visual wows.:::1:::None
There are imperfections but there is entertainment value in Limitless, not the least being Bradley Cooper's engaging central performance. There's a twist but it's not what you think and the visuals are fabulous:::1:::None

The coming-of-age pic has a sense of deeply felt gravity.:::1:::B
Margaret is a pointless coming-of-age drama starring Anna Paquin that tediously meanders on for two and half hours before ending with a whimper.:::0:::4/10
This is an America in which nobody listens, the end always justifies the means, and it's always the other guy's fault. Blame is tricky when everyone is failing everyone.:::1:::A-
... it should be commended for attempting to tackle something as basic - and insurmountable - as a single human emotion.:::1:::5/5
Epic and personal, challenging and strange.:::1:::4.5/5
It has its flaws, but I defy you to find a more intelligent or impassioned American film this year.:::1:::None
An epic drama whose significance is symbolized by citations from Shakespeare and the operatic world.:::1:::A-
Margaret is an absorbing character study headlined by a wonderful performance from Anna Paquin.:::1:::A-
Presumably Lonergan meant Margaret to be a tapestry. Instead, it's a series of incongruous threads.:::0:::2/5
In a sterling central performance, Anna Paquin (True Blood; The Piano) is outstanding as she courses through a broad palette of hard-edged emotions in this searing post-9/11 drama about honesty and culpability.:::1:::4/5
Its commentary on the nature of performance and its political subtext make for an unconventional end product.:::1:::4/5
If you wanted to see this troubled, acclaimed, mishandled movie, you had to go to New York, Los Angeles, or fly 40,000 feet above the Earth. Talk about a limited release.:::1:::5/5
Ambitious, affecting, unwieldy and haunting, it's an eccentric, densely atmospheric, morally hyper-aware masterpiece...:::1:::4/4
What's here is borderline camp at times, intermittently revealing a promise of brilliance perhaps left behind for good in 2005.:::1:::B-
It's a passionate, fascinating mess, like its abrasive main character.:::1:::2.5/4
It's a challenging movie, but it pays off in big ideas and stunning performances.:::1:::3.5/4
Rather like Clint Eastwood's Hereafter, which also starred Matt Damon, there is certainly a good film in here trying to get out and there's a neatly-emotional ending, but it's not as consistent as [director Kenneth Longergan's] You Can Count on Me.:::1:::3/5
Never has a troubled film project's off-screen drama played out so clearly in the release product.:::0:::2/4
Messy but masterful; a sprawling portrait of what it means to be a bright young woman who's realizing that the world isn't the warm bath of acceptance that her privileged life would indicate.:::1:::3.5/4
Ambitious, stunningly-acted, smart, and astoundingly not outstaying its welcome despite a beefy run time, Margaret is destined to become a cult classic.:::1:::4/5
Margaret comes apart at the seams as you watch it, but it gives off a lovely light. Seek it out. You can thank me later.:::1:::3.5/4
Complex and elusive, the film weaves so many utterly believable and often devastating narrative strands that you wish Lonergan had got his way and released his initial 4hr cut:::1:::None
Margaret is - or at least might have been - very much a film of its time, and that time was the mid-Noughties... now the film might easily be viewed as just another rites-of-passage indie - albeit an unusually multi-faceted one.:::1:::None
Haunting and thought-provoking despite flaws; an important post-9/11 movie with its own troubled mythology.:::1:::3/5
An intelligent, thoughtful film, the title of which comes from the "Margaret" addressed in Gerard Manley Hopkins's poem "Spring and Fall: To a Young Child" about growing up and growing old.:::1:::None
Paquin, whose squirmy style of acting I've never liked, is astounding here...:::1:::4/5
Paquin creates that rarest of things: a profoundly unsympathetic character who is mysteriously, mesmerically, operatically compelling to watch.:::1:::5/5
The acting is uniformly wonderful. It's a phoenix of a film, risen from the ashes of what looked alarmingly like failure, and it needs to be seen.:::1:::5/5
No group of actors in a film ever had so little time to establish so much complexity or succeeded with such consummate skill.:::1:::5/5
It's a powerfully involving exploration of guilt and self-discovery. It's also packed with astonishingly complex characters and situations.:::1:::4/5
Paquin - a 29-year-old playing a teenager - is outstanding as the bolshie adolescent doggedly pursuing a mawkish retribution, exquisitely delivering Lonergan's drily painful bon mots while trying the patience as flakey torch for truth...if not justice.:::1:::4/5
Impressively directed and superbly written, this is a powerfully emotional drama with an Oscar-worthy central performance from Anna Paquin.:::1:::4/5
There might be a five-hour version of the movie that plays like Citizen Kane, but in its theatrical form, it's a Jackson Pollock painting minus the soul.:::0:::1.5/5
One of the most original and heartbreaking and wonderfully messy & idiosyncratic films released in 2011.:::1:::8/10
For all its awkwardness and uncertainty, the film is a city symphony, romantic yet scathing, lyrical with street life and vaulting skylines, reckless with first adventure...:::1:::None
Margaret definitely has many elements for a successful drama. It's unfortunate that no one was able to shape them into a functional movie.:::0:::2/5
Margaret is a mess. An impressive mess, but a mess nonetheless.:::0:::C-
Weirdly, you can see how terrific Margaret should have been.:::1:::3/5
Kenneth Lonergan's new film, Margaret, finally released six years after it was shot, now seems destined to become part of film history as one of the more stunning examples of a filmmaker's sophomore slump.:::0:::2/4
An ambitious, novelistic, sprawling story that attempts to show a young woman's internal development while simultaneously conveying the soul of modern-day New York.:::1:::3/4
Margaret turns out to be, despite a number of flaws, a far more interesting and gripping work than its extremely checkered past might otherwise suggest.:::1:::4/5
...an ambitious yet hopelessly cluttered mess of epic proportions...:::0:::1.5/4
It took six years to make this movie. Do yourself a favor: don't wait six years to see it.:::1:::A-
How do you assess a movie when you know it's been edited down against the filmmaker's stern will? That's the dilemma created by Margaret.:::1:::B-
Its hard look at a young, morally confused woman struggling for clarity is nothing short of riveting.:::1:::3/4
Lonergan, who casts himself as Lisa's lukewarm father, a screenwriter, possesses a rare talent for elevating an embarrassing sequence into sadness or tragedy.:::1:::3.5/4
What an interesting failure "Margaret" is.:::0:::2.5/5
Though a bit choppy, it emerges as a thoughtful, compelling piece about guilt, redemption--and the difficulty of coming to terms with the moral complexity in human affairs.:::1:::B+
Kenneth Lonergan offers no resolutions in this complex and moving parable, unless it's the observation that the only resolutions in life are in art.:::1:::3.5/4
What it does have going for it is a pre-True Blood Anna Paquin, who burns up the screen with a bravura performance in a complex and discomfiting role.:::1:::2.5/4
Retains a powerful, fickle interest in confronting the randomness, frustration and difficult choices that seep into everyone's life eventually.:::1:::3/4
On occasion, the film captures a welcome cross-section of modern New York life, serving as a freeform antidote to the intersecting-lives tidiness of similar films from the likes of Haggis and Inarritu.:::1:::None
...a work of great psychological understanding and one of the most artistically satisfying reactions to 9/11 put to film.:::1:::B+
A jumbled mass of conflicting impulses? Yes. Lurching and at times pretentious? Yes. But still a film with a lot of distinct, wide-eyed personality, even if it hangs oddly.:::1:::3/5
A fascinating, deeply felt film of wild, untamed emotions and probing insights.:::1:::4/5
Chaotic coming-of-age drama with teen sex, drugs.:::0:::2/5
The film's imperfections work in the sense that they rhyme with the agitation and sense of dislocation the characters feel.:::1:::3/4
Despite a wrenching opening that saddleMoneyball is a winner, one of the freshest and smartest sports movies in years.:::1:::3.5/4
Directed by Capote's Bennett Miller, this is one helluva good sports movie. It's a terrific movie, period.:::1:::None
Writer Aaron Sorkin works best at auctioneer speeds, and some of the best scenes involve Pitt's character working the phones, calling and stalling other teams' managers, trading players like a used-car salesman.:::1:::3.5/4
This is a baseball story that's less about game-winning hits and more about people willing to challenge the establishment.:::1:::4/5
Brad Pitt is at the top of his own game as Beane. Cocky and often nonchalant, he is gnawed by doubts that he tries to cover by grabbing a snack or pitching a grin.:::1:::4/4
That such a literally spreadsheet-intensive story could register real human thought and feeling at all has to count as some kind of triumph.:::1:::4/5
Moneyball is a great sports movie, yes, but it will also cross audiences. It's one of the year's finest.:::1:::4/4
Moneyball looks like an underdog sports movie, but it veers away from the path usually followed by films of the genre. My suggestion is that you set aside any preconceptions and just go with the flow.:::1:::3.5/5
Australia may not exactly be mad for the game, but I suspect - I hope - that the latest film from Bennett Miller (Capote) will inspire a few more people to become immersed in it.:::1:::None
A well-written and incredibly smart film about baseball.:::1:::5.0/5
The film tries to coast on its charm without asking much of its audience.:::0:::C+

A thinking person's baseball movie.:::1:::3.5/4
Great performances, exciting moments, and creative cinematography make Moneyball a home run for both baseball and movie fans.:::1:::4/5
With its wonderful performances and well-written script, "Moneyball" is one of the better sports movies of recent years.:::1:::3.5/4
Moneyball is more interesting than your typical sports drama thanks to the direction. Bennett Miller takes a rather grey, cement-enshrouded setting and gives it a little pizzazz.:::1:::7.5/10
The end result mirrors the actual season Moneyball depicts, a memorable run but a loss in the final game played.:::1:::B
A fine, strong, adult movie, and its theme can easily apply to any number of other walks of life.:::1:::4/5
Even when delving deep into stats talk, one doesn't need to be at all interested in baseball, much less sports geek minutiae, to be hooked in.:::1:::3.5/4

Moneyball is, in the end, undone by its excessively subdued atmosphere and pace...:::0:::2/4
With razor sharp wit and delivery, Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill are sensational together, hitting Moneyball clean and out of the park.:::1:::4.5/5
I enjoyed this film... with certain reservations.:::1:::None
Two features into his directing career, Bennett Miller has managed to refresh not only the traditional biopic, but the inspirational sports drama as well.:::1:::4/4
Jerry Maguire just got some overdue company with Moneyball, which features Pitt and Hill in perhaps their most likable roles.:::1:::7/10
Keeps the economic talk in check and brings the human drama to the forefront.:::1:::None

A highly detailed, fascinating slice of baseball history, 'Moneyball' will appeal to both sports aficionados and those (like yours truly) who are not. This is the true story of how a manager met the challenge of a small budget and beat the odds.:::1:::4/4
While its compatriots focus on strength, Moneyball celebrates strategy, recounting the unlikely true story of how brains triumphed over brawn:::1:::4/5
'Moneyball' Shows What You Can Tell.:::1:::None
A wordy but well-paced and thrilling film, closer to co-writer Aaron Sorkin's The Social Network than previous baseball-themed big hitters Bull Durham or Field of Dreams.:::1:::4/5
Fascinating, moving and very funny to boot, this will entertain both those who love the game and those who say: "It's just Rounders!" Brilliant.:::1:::4/5
Consistently exciting and highly intelligent, as you might expect from a script by Steve Zaillian, who wrote Schindler's List, and Aaron Sorkin, who created The West Wing and won an Oscar for The Social Network.:::1:::None
Pitt is terrific as the film's complex, driven protagonist, and he and a heavy-hitting supporting cast, including Philip Seymour Hoffman's stubborn coach, take Aaron Sorkin's smart script and knock the ball right out of the park.:::1:::None
I had been reduced to a slobbering gushy mess by the end of this gloriously entertaining movie even though I'd spend the entirety of the running time before this marveling at how this is the least sentimental baseball movie ever.:::1:::None
Thanks to the strange kind of alchemy that makes films as joyously unpredictable as any evenly-balanced sporting fixture, putting Pitt in a baseball movie pays off with remarkable results.:::1:::3/5
It's an engaging, almost exotic film.:::1:::3/5
Brad Pitt in a dugout. Oh dear; oh dear. Here is baseball, reel upon reel and inning upon inning.:::0:::2/5
What we're left with is a sporadically entertaining mess. Moneyball is unsure about what (if any) risks it should take.:::1:::3/5
The mark of a truly great sports movie is one that appeals to people who don't like sports.:::1:::4/5
An accomplished, bracingly intelligent film that scores points on all fronts...:::1:::4/5
It's the best film about statistics you're ever likely to see.:::1:::4/5
Impressively directed and sharply written, this is a hugely enjoyable, largely cliche-resistant sports drama with great performances from Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill.:::1:::4/5
A topical corporate shakedown story that anyone can relate to in this day and age, and it's all down to the Pitt-Hill chemistry that keeps you engaged.:::1:::4/5
Even if you're not at all familiar with the story, this was bound to happen, as they were hardly going to make a film about a losing team.:::1:::4/5
While making no effort to explain the terminology - mathematical or baseball-ical - the script throws enough fastballs to keep even the most ignorant of us Limeys entertained.:::1:::3/5
As an example of smarter-than-average Hollywood fare - and a sly dig at modern sporting politics - 'Moneyball' has all the key bases covered.:::1:::3/5
You don't need to understand anything of baseball to get behind this, a chest-swelling story about second chances and flipping a finger up (even a giant foam one) to The Man.:::1:::4/5
Based on Michael Lewis' nonfiction book, this film is written, directed and played with both intelligence and emotion.:::1:::4/5
Possibly the smartest, sharpest baseball movie since 1988's Bull Durham.:::1:::None
America's favourite past time is turned into a numbers game, as tradition clashes with progression in the baseball drama Moneyball.:::1:::4.5/5
A sports movie about disappointment and falling just short. Manages to make the dealing, stealing, and brain-wheeling in stadium offices enthralling.:::1:::None
Though it can't top the source material, Moneyball the movie is much like the undervalued players (misfit toys, as they're described) that Beane hires to populate his team on the cheap: it gets on base every time, and is occasionally exceptional.:::1:::4/5
Moneyball is a restrained drama with moments of unconventional excitement.:::1:::3.5/5
Of course it's a story of the little guys taking on the giants but it's so much more. Even if you don't like sports movies you'd be hard pressed not to enjoy this one.:::1:::4.5/5
A fascinating and entertaining peek inside the part of big-time sports that we rarely see and an odd couple's determination to think outside the batter's box.:::1:::B+
Despite the hoopla surrounding its premiere at this year's Toronto International Film Festival, this fact-based baseball drama remains a rather dry, if serviceable, affair.:::1:::7/10
A sharp, shrewd and satisfying film about winning, losing and playing the odds, when the odds are playing statistics instead of relying on conventional gut instincts:::1:::None
It reeled me in very quickly with its interesting story, a few surprising twists and an unexpected number of laughs.:::1:::A-
Despite being a tale of the front office, it also works as a tale of the haves vs. the have-nots, and rarely panders to its audience, putting it in the higher eschelon of sports-underdog movies.:::1:::3/4
There are lots of films about baseball and only a handful of films about mathematics--even fewer showing mathematics in a favorable light.:::1:::7/10
Bracingly brainy:::1:::None
Does a crowd-pleasing job of drawing out the drama, tension and subtle sideline shadings of a story that is essential built on a high-stakes game of numbers.:::1:::4/5
More closely resembles The Social Network than it does can-of-corn horsehide epics like Field of Dreams or The Natural.:::1:::None
I kept hoping for something about the film to surprise me. Very little did.:::1:::B-
Brad Pitt is having a really good year.:::1:::4/5
Like a businessman settling into his recliner after a hard day's work, Brad Pitt has slid into middle age with an ease that's both pleasurable and enviable to watch.:::1:::3/4
...isn't really a baseball movie, or even a sports movie - it feels more like a smart procedural from the '70s.:::1:::89/100
One of the most fascinating star turns of the year.:::1:::7/10
unfolds smoothly as the kind of baseball movie that even those who couldn't care less about baseball will find engrossing:::1:::3/4
A winner.:::1:::None
Tasteful, entertaining, but not entirely satisfying. 'How can you not be romantic about baseball?' Beane asks, twice. A more relevant question might be: How can you be romantic about sabermetrics?:::1:::3/4
Recognizes that sometimes, happily-ever-afters are more complicated than uplifting Hollywood films can manage.:::1:::B
Pitt is mesmerizing --- he's high-strung and laid-back all at once. It's an Oscar-worthy performance.:::1:::None
Don't be surprised when Brad Pitt's name is announced in the Best Actor category.:::1:::None
It is not easy to make a film about quiet courage and unassuming heroes like these, but this film rises to that challenge and hits one right out of the park.:::1:::A
Brad Pitt may be the big draw but it is Jonah Hill's performance that gives the film its flavor. And when they are both on screen the movie is at its best.:::1:::7/10
One of the most soulful of baseball movies -- it confronts the anguish of a very tough game.:::1:::None
Immediately one of my favorite baseball films, as well as one of my favorite Pitt performances. Only time will tell if I can delete 'one of' from those sentences.:::1:::9/10
Moneyball is an impelling triple. It's smart, agile, and effective. But it's anti-climactic. Director Bennett Miller and writers Sorkin and Zaillian could swing for a home run, but instead they settle for a base on balls.:::1:::2.5/5
A tender reminder that the heart sometimes still matters even if we now live in a technology-driven, Digital Age where machines lead and humans follow.:::1:::4/4
It's the movie baseball hot stove and transaction junkies have been waiting for their entire lives.:::1:::4.5/5
A sports movie that gives us something more than a key win to root for, but its extra-innings length takes some spin off the ball.:::1:::3.5/5
It really really all comes down to one star banner: Brad Pitt unfurled.:::1:::B+
An entertaining look at what could have been a very dry subject.:::1:::3.5/4
Baseball, for better or worse, has always held itself to greater importance, suffused with the history of the nation itself.:::1:::3.5/5
A decent baseball pic, which is rare.:::1:::B
I'm not sure I've ever seen a sports movie quite like this, and that's a major compliment.:::1:::3.5/4
the unfathomable blend of chance and expertise at work do more than dazzle, they explain why men and women will surrender their lives to a dream.:::1:::4/5
Moneyball soars, not on game footage, but on Beane confronting the naysayers, or working with Brand to bring his unorthodox methods into this most orthodox of sports.:::1:::4.5/5
Far more than a baseball movie, it's already generating terrific Oscar buzz.:::1:::10/10
...holds its characters and the implications of its story at a cool distance.:::1:::5/10
Moneyball is a film about losers, but when those losers do manage to pull out a win, it's truly something to cheer.:::1:::B+
Like the 2002 Oakland A's, Moneyball is far from perfect. It has some great moments, but there are plenty of losses along the way.:::1:::3.5/5
For all the concentration on numbers, the film never loses sight of the fact that this is a game of people.:::1:::9/10
Just like any baseball game, "Moneyball" has its slow points. But while you're waiting for something of substance to happen, there are plenty of worthwhile glimpses behind the scenes of a low-budget baseball club to keep your interest.:::1:::3.5/4
The real protagonist of Moneyball, however, is Beane himself, played with great charisma by Brad Pitt.:::1:::None
Now if only Zaillian and Sorkin could work their magic and make the actual game of baseball that exciting.:::1:::4/5
Brad Pitt knocks it out of the park in 'Moneyball'.:::1:::B plus
[Pitt] provides ballast and a swaggering humor to a movie that, too often, strives to be The Social Network of baseball movies.:::1:::B
Pitt, who has a producing credit, is not the sole reason this tremendous -- yet intimate -- sports tale soars over the fences. The bench is deep. And the script has a powerful but finessed swing.:::1:::3.5/4
Moneyball turns an unlikely subject interesting, making a professional sport the nexus where past and future collide.:::1:::B-
The entertaining banter between Pitt and Jonah Hill isn't quite enough to make such an insular world compelling.:::0:::C+
Moneyball is exactly like moneyball -- infused with intelligence, amusing in its attacks on false gods, but way easier to admire than to love.:::1:::3/4
The best baseball movie since Bull Durham -- albeit still a notch below that movie's league.:::1:::4/5
Moneyball is a rare beast: a sports film that is actually a good film.:::1:::8/10
Pitt takes one of the least showy roles of his career and turns it into one of his best.:::1:::4.5/5
With phenomenal performances given by its key leads, Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill, the film works on multiple levels and can be considered as one of the best films of 2011. You don't have to a baseball to enjoy this film. It's pure, solid entertainment.:::1:::3.5/4
You'll laugh quite a bit at Moneyball, snickering at the absurdity of the situations and the often more ridiculous responses. What you might not do is care.:::1:::3/5
It inspires because it says that sometimes overlooked people are worth a second look, without succumbing to a Disneyfied "anything is possible if you follow your dreams" trope.:::1:::3.5/4
[Moneyball] manages to make the analysis of stats a fascinating subject matter for a feature film.:::1:::B
Regrets, second chances and the intense pressures of professional sports collide in this terrific drama, capped by an excellent performance from Brad Pitt.:::1:::A-
Sophisticated and hugely entertaining, with Pitt and Hill an unlikely but terrific buddy team. A delight even for someone who knows and cares next to nothing about baseball.:::1:::None
Fantastic, inspiring baseball drama covers all its bases.:::1:::4/5
The unlikely tandem of Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill helps drive what is arguably the most compelling and insightful baseball-themed film since Robert Redford launched a homerun into the stadium lights in The Natural.:::1:::3.5/4
It should be no shock that the film is intelligent and well-made, considering the source material... What's somewhat surprising is how engrossing a story about the business side of baseball can be...:::1:::None
Pitt is outstanding putting his heart and soul into this Oscar-caliber performance. Hill offers comedic relief as the awkward, fish-out-of-water computer nerd. The hearty round of applause at the end of the advance screening indicates the groundswell of..:::1:::4/4
It's the best baseball movie since "Bull Durham.":::1:::4/4
What is most maddening about "Moneyball" is that its Hall of Fame potential is squandered on crass sentimentality, a lack of focus and a exasperating refusal to take a hard look at the way the business of baseball is run today.:::0:::2/4
Coasts along the old-fashioned way: On great performances and a surprisingly engaging script:::1:::3/4
"Moneyball" isn't ultimately about baseball as much as it is an exploration of those who do and don't adapt to change.:::1:::2.5/4
Brad Pitt rips through the dialogue in one of the easiest, funniest and most natural performances of the year. He and this movie knock it out of the park.:::1:::4.5/5
While the screen tells us it's 2002, the struggle to define ourselves within an economic chokehold couldn't be more on the money right now.:::1:::9/10
A highly entertaining and smart piece of entertainment (Parental Movie Review also available):::1:::None
Once I stopped pining for the movie Moneyball might have been, I settled in and had a good time with what it was.:::1:::None
A terrific film that makes a point about winning that is sophisticated and left me with a deep appreciation for anyone who tries to do something revolutionary and is afraid of failure but doesn't let that fear stop them.:::1:::8.5/10
It's hard not to be romantic about this film!:::1:::4/5
A well-written, sharply acted film that's guaranteed to garner attention.:::1:::3/4
Brad Pitt's the MVP here, of course, giving a great worn-down, tired-eyed, torn-in-too-many-directions performance, the kind they give awards to when it's time for that sort of thing.:::1:::4.5/5
The great thing about this movie is that it works even if you don't follow or care about baseball.:::1:::4/5
A smart, subtle and quotable tale that's happy to take that familiar formula and give it frequent, unsentimental, but still satisfying, tweaks.:::1:::3.5/4
One of the most electrifying and entertaining movies of the year.:::1:::5/5
Moneyball lies at the intersection of math and baseball, where -- wait, come back! It isn't boring, I promise!:::1:::B
Moneyball is slick and good-looking, and it feels alive to its very core.:::1:::3.5/4
Pitt's grace under fire carries things along nicely, and there's a fine supporting performance by Parks And Recreation's Chris Pratt as uncertain first baseman Scott Hatteberg.:::1:::3/5
Naysayers have been claiming for years that the Moneyball book wouldn't work as a movie. But ultimately, it's the cinematic touches that keep this film version from becoming something exceptional.:::0:::2/4
Like a cold beer under a bluebird sky; like a flawless line drive on a warm summer's day; like a long, languorous seventh-inning stretch - "Moneyball" satisfies.:::1:::4/4
A crowd-pleasing baseball movie for people - like me - who don't like baseball movies.:::1:::3.5/4
"Moneyball" is consistently entertaining, even if it doesn't add up to much.:::1:::3/4
Director Bennett Miller wisely allows Pitt to dominate the movie with his irresistible charisma.:::1:::3.5/4
Proving second chances can happen "Moneyball" takes you on a joyous journey that makes it one of the top family films of 2011.:::1:::4/5
...much of what makes it all work is Pitt and Hill, who have the kind of quirky chemistry that pops off the screen but always feels rooted in reality.:::1:::B+
I'm still wondering how people indifferent to baseball will respond to the story of the 2002 Oakland Athletics and their smartest-kid-in-the-sandbox general manager. But I will say this - the casting is strong, and the human drama has universal appeal.:::1:::3/4
Oscar season has officially begun.:::1:::A+
A whip-smart, tough-minded treatment of the world's most sentimentalized subject.:::1:::B+
There's nothing romantic about the behind-the-scenes look at baseball in Moneyball. It's a story of negotiations, statistics, professional clashes, and inner turmoil.:::1:::3.5/4
it is Pitt who is in every way the heart of the movie, his natural confidence and grace a lovely balance to the formulas with Greek letters and the endless statistics.:::1:::A-
Some might call it a thinking man's sports movie, but that's both untrue and condescending. It's just... different.:::1:::3.5/5
An inspirational story that brings everyone to the handrail cheering and clapping.:::1:::4/5
It takes a brave studio picture to recognize that there's sometimes more to the sports genre than the common trifles and clich&eacute;s audiences have been predisposed to expect these days.:::1:::3/4
Moneyball easily stands among the finest baseball movies around, though I admit that's not saying a whole lot since competition in that category is fairly light.:::1:::77/100
This is a real Cinderella tale about a man whose vision brought his team from the bottom of the barrel to the top of the heap.:::1:::A-
Miller, who earned a Best Director Academy Award nomination for "Capote," keeps the tone of the film flowing seamlessly. He works in archival footage brilliantly, giving the game sequences almost a documentary feel.:::1:::5/5
"Moneyball" offers real drama that's tied to both a big game and a big picture.:::1:::B+
Has to be described as an example of what Hollywood does best.:::1:::None
It's to the director's credit, and Pitt's, that Moneyball is anything but bloodless -- in its own quiet, unspectacular way, this movie courses with life.:::1:::None
It's tense, strangely funny in a lot of spots and -- if you grew up loving old-fashioned, seat-of-the-pants baseball, as I did -- the most depressing movie of the year.:::1:::3.5/4
Moneyball astutely depicts money as the hot-button dividing line in our culture and reflects the value that true success comes not from wealth, but from having the vision to try something new, and the confidence to pursue it.:::1:::4/4
Smart, minor-key entertainment.:::1:::B+
Baseball fans know this story, but Miller puts it all in fascinating context. This is a thinking person's baseball movie, a more complex version of the inspirational sports story.:::1:::3.5/4
Starring Brad Pitt in top movie star form, it's a film that's impressive and surprising.:::1:::None
A deeply American film about a uniquely American sport in which a principled guy takes on the moneyed titans because he can't stand the unfairness of what they're doing to the game he still loves.:::1:::None
This is a film about a guy fighting the establishment. I don't think one has to be a baseball fan, or even know anything about it, to enjoy it.:::1:::9/10
Pitt's Beane is as original a character as I've seen in a baseball drama.:::1:::4/4
Moneyball should be a much better movie than it actually is.:::0:::3/5
It gives Mr. Pitt, who hurtles through the movie, a chance to scat like a juiced-up Ella Fitzgerald, working his phones and seemingly every other general manager in the country, as he transforms a new baseball philosophy into action.:::1:::None
Although you don't have to be a sports fan to enjoy it, "Moneyball" is one of the best baseball movies imaginable.:::1:::3.5/4
the truest, most intimate underdog film in years.:::1:::4.5/5
A solid, bustling social comedy at the 130-IQ level, Moneyball boasts the zinging, stinging repartee of grown men working at a kids' game and tired of being handed the prevailing line of bull.:::1:::None
...a smart sports film that's as unique in its approach to the genre as Beane's was to the sport.:::1:::A-
"Moneyball'' is a hilarious and provocative change-up, entertaining without feeling the need to swing for the fences.:::1:::3.5/4
To say that "Moneyball" is "inside baseball" is to undersell the idea of that sentence. This extraordinary hybrid of a movie lives and breathes the game, yet its achievement is bigger than that.:::1:::4/5
Dramatizing executives at their labors, even those privileged to bask in sexy industries like Major League Baseball, shouldn't make for scintillating cinema, but Moneyball, like the team it celebrates, finds a way to win.:::1:::None
Moneyball illustrates what can happen when a non-fiction book that's more about ideas and processes is translated into a feature film.:::1:::3/4
Don't be surprised to see Pitt in the best-actor Oscar race come the new year.:::1:::4/4
"Moneyball" exploits Pitt's regular-guy likability without sacrificing the procedural elements or dumbing down the baseball.:::1:::3.5/4
Moneyball is a smart, funny, and thoughtful baseball movie that tells us more about what happens in the managers' offices than out on the ball field.:::1:::3.5/5
The dramas and relationships that matter are off the field, and they sort of feel like Oakland A's baseball - a lot of walks and singles, not a lot of home runs.:::1:::B
Even if you think you don't care about baseball, I'd urge you to give it a try.:::1:::9/10
A witty and captivating look at thinking outside the diamond.:::1:::None
On some level "Moneyball" is about loyalty: loyalty to an idea, loyalty to a partnership forged by desperation, loyalty to the values you believe in.:::1:::4/5
Moneyball is one of the best and most viscerally exciting films of the year.:::1:::3.5/4
Both a radical departure from the sports genre norm ... and an ultimate affirmation of the thrill of the game:::1:::4/5
"Moneyball" reminds us, in case we needed reminding, why Brad Pitt is a movie star.:::1:::3.5/4
A sharp, smart script...manages to make [a] potentially dreary subject almost as fascinating as Sorkin did the world of computer programming in 'The Social Network.':::1:::B+
Everything in Beane's story and in "Moneyball" could've been rendered dull or sappy or both by a lesser director. It is, at heart, about a man out to redeem himself.:::1:::4/4
Geek-stats book turned into a movie with a lot of heart.:::1:::4/5
If you like baseball, you will love this movie. If you hate baseball, you will still love this movie.:::1:::4/4
It seems absurd on its face to convert Lewis' tale of front-office wrangling into a sports movie, but Bennett Miller's shrewd adaptation, scripted by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin, turns it into Major League for stats wonks.:::1:::B+
Pitt and Hill make Beane and Brand seem like the year's most intriguing couple, bringing deep shades of humour and pathos to their characters that help make Moneyball more than just another sports or baseball movie.:::1:::3.5/4
A smart, intense and moving film that isn't so much about sports as about the war between intuition and statistics.:::1:::4/4
A wavering, intermittently smart story of daring to think differently that often flattens its narrative into formula.:::0:::2/4
Baseball teams have more than three players on them.:::0:::2.5/4
Miller does a great job of making number-crunching and deal-brokering exciting.:::1:::3.5/5
...has the snap and crackle of a timely behind-the-scenes documentary.:::1:::3/4
Like Billy Beane's 2002 Oakland A's, this movie may not be a total winner, but it sure offers up a lot of memorable thrills.:::1:::None
Baseball curses are tough to beat (as anyone in Boston can tell you), and at least this one left us with a decent movie.:::1:::3/5
It's raunchy but harmless:::1:::3.5/5
This is a nerd movie made by n00bs.:::0:::C
A sort of comedy homage to seminal sci-fi movie culture from the 80s, Paul never takes itself too seriously and is a lot of fun.:::1:::7/10
Passable f-bomb riddled fanboy fare, a bit of a comedown from Frost and Pegg's British movies.:::1:::2.5/4
Paul is probably the closest thing to Spaced that Pegg and Frost have made since Edgar Wright closed the book on Tim & Daisy.:::1:::4/5
It's not a bad film by any means, it was just slightly disappointing especially when you take into account the talents of Pegg and Frost.:::0:::2.5/4
Surprisingly smart and filled with homage, Paul is crass and a little rough around the edges, but thoroughly enjoyable.:::1:::8/10
Vale mucho mas la pena ver (o volver a ver) alguno de los antecedentes de la dupla Simon Pegg y Nick Frost, como Shaun of the dead, Hot fuzz o la serie Spaced.:::0:::2/5
... A very funny movie with its heart in the right place.:::1:::B+
A refreshingly rollicking, sweetly raunchy comedy about a little green dude just trying to get home.:::1:::3/5
The comic targets and the central manchildren bromance all feel overly familiar...Still, Paul benefits from Pegg and Frost's British comedic slant and the full complement of comedic talent... [Blu-ray]:::1:::2.5/4
Paul is slacker than the duo's previous efforts, but the gags still come thick and fast.:::1:::None
Pegg and Frost shoehorn in so many one-liners taken from other movies they're like embarrassing uncles at a wedding who have bet they can add a sci-fi twist to every conversation.:::0:::5/10
It's not the comedy of the year, but it counts as a fun night out at the movies.:::1:::3/5
The poster is cute, the trailer cuter. "Paul" the movie? Don't ask.:::0:::1.5/4
Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are two guys who know what they like and whenever they turn their hands to writing a script, you can feel that enthusiasm in every line.:::1:::4/5
Pegg and Frost have been better, but Paul is still good for a few laughs.:::1:::None
With so much reliable talent involved in this film it is extremely disappointing that it is only a mildly amusing comedy with a smattering of reasonably fun science-fiction references.:::0:::2.5/5
While not as consistently funny or sharp as their previous pairings, Paul is a heartfelt tribute to friendship, what lies beyond the stars, and being a nerd.:::1:::3/5
It is not that Paul is in any way a bad movie. It is just a very average one.:::0:::2.5/5
Passably funny, though one suspects even diehard sci-fi buffs will find the film's wall-to-wall pop referencing tiring and a tad lazy. Doesn't anybody write genuine jokes any more?:::1:::2.5/5
Paul proves that these children of science fiction have bloomed into a rotten bunch indeed.:::0:::2/5
This is a madcap ride with hilarious and occasionally touching references to many other films about aliens.:::1:::4/5
Paul isn't as riotous as the early Pegg and Frost movies, but it does have a certain sweetness. Everyone in it is sort of innocent, except Paul, the alien wisecracker. It's likeable, if uneven, rather than hilarious.:::1:::3/5
That the film is an often hilarious love letter to other, better films is what prevents it from forging its own identity like Edgar Wright's mini-masterpieces.:::1:::None
The film can be summed up by its affectionate parody E.T in the finale: amiable and inoffensive but completely inferior to the classic films it references.:::1:::None
Director Greg Mottola did not understand what makes a Simon Pegg comedy funny. And neither did Simon Pegg or co-writer Nick Frost.:::0:::5/10
It's strange in that the best material seems to have been saved for the supporting cast members.:::0:::B-
Paul is a fun tribute to sci-fi films (and film geekery in general), but did it have to be so ... dumb?:::1:::3/5
If it's escapist fun you want, just go with Paul:::1:::None
It's a road movie, a buddy movie, a chase movie and a sci-fi spoof, all rolled into one hilarious madcap adventure:::1:::None
This is both a fitting tribute to those "my best friend is an alien/computer/talking cat/whatever" movies from the '80s and funny on its own terms, and that's two more boxes ticked than a lot of comedies manage.:::1:::4/5
Packed with references to other films instead of original jokes, this goofy comedy at least keeps us laughing all the way through. The idea itself is hilarious, and the movie's assembled with skill and energy.:::1:::3.5/5
This one needed more time in the oven.:::0:::2.5/5
Paul has a terrific concept -- an affectionate send-up of the sci-fi genre. Paul has it ups, but it also has unfortunate downs. Instead of going to the moon, it goes to Wyoming.:::1:::2.5/5
A fun ride through a comic twilight zone.:::1:::3/4
Even with a wee too many bladder jokes, Paul is sweet and often hilarious. . .:::1:::3/4
An amusingly absurd Close Encounters wish-fulfillment fantasy for sci-fi fans.:::1:::7/10
...elevated by the charisma of the various actors and by the enjoyably tongue-in-cheek nature of Pegg and Frost's screenplay.:::1:::2.5/4
It's not nearly as engaging as the many films it parodies, but it's a charming little tribute.:::1:::6.8/10
How strange that two of my favorite movies so far this year star little green men. 'Paul,' the latest Simon Pegg/Nick Frost movie, is a science-fiction comedy that's strictly for grownups. It's raunchy, rude and raucous.:::1:::3.5/4
A whole lot sillier, raunchier, and sweeter than its advertising suggests.:::1:::4/5
Paul is offensive solely for being so underachieving.:::0:::2.5/5
A foul-mouthed 'Mac and Me,' funnier than its mostly lukewarm reviews suggest...:::1:::3/4
... a sort of trailer-trash remake of E.T. ...:::1:::3/5
Well, that's one joke. Ninety more minutes to go.:::0:::2/4
Moderately funny, satisfying tribute to sci-fi.:::1:::3/5
Pegg and Frost tackle something more menacing than flesh-eating zombies or angry villagers: the US of A.:::1:::None
Paul starts strong with a lot of affectionate, funny jokes about geek culture, book signings, UFOs and comic book conventions, but it eventually falls into self-parody.:::0:::None
It's not perfect, but it is consistently fun.:::1:::4/5
Paul is aimed primarily at comic-book fans and cosmos-loving adults who aren't easily offended. But the phenomenal cast, funny script and solid pacing help make Paul a stellar cinematic excursion for even the most down-to-earth humans.:::1:::3.5/4
Paul brings back all that is consequential through an ingenious spoof of taken-for-granted sci-fi lore.:::1:::None
Would have been a great movie for kids but that pesky R rating gets in the way.:::0:::5/10
The film has some laughs. But it also has a million jokes about anal probes, alien genitalia, and people thinking Clive and Graeme are gay. These guys can do better than this.:::0:::C
This is a love letter, a very funny love letter, to science fiction films like 'Aliens' and 'E.T.':::1:::B+
Not Shaun, but still pretty good.:::1:::4/5
The CGI alien is very well articulated, and Rogen is a virtuoso at mixing motormouthed rudeness with a hint of tenderness to take off the edge.:::1:::None
It's definitely not terrible. I just expected so much more from Pegg, Frost, Mottola and a great supporting cast and subject.:::1:::6/10
Though more attuned to broader humour than the whip-smart wit and cleverness of Pegg and Frost's British comedies, Paul definitely has a loopy charm.:::1:::3/5
"Paul" might not connect with everyone, but it's certainly funny and heartfelt enough to please those brave enough to see it. It seems destined for a cult following rather than a legion of converted geeks.:::1:::B
"Paul" is a science fiction fan's delight, filled with references and situations reminiscent of some iconic favorites.:::1:::3.5/4
Paul is ultimately a sweet homage to pop culture geeks, sci-fi aficionados and anyone who came of age on a steady diet of Spielberg blockbusters.:::1:::3/4
[I]t's a sendup done with real affection and with the odd notion that those advanced aliens may be just as big a bunch of goofballs as we are.:::1:::4.5/5
Paul is arguably the best science fiction comedy since Galaxy Quest.:::1:::3/4
A Valentine to all things sci-fi that insiders will adore and outsiders will enjoy without feeling lost.:::1:::B+
Paul's a road movie where the joy of hanging out with the characters is half the point, and these are characters that would be fun to revisit again and again.:::1:::None
This is a very good film. One imagines though that it could have been great... very great indeed.:::1:::3.5/5
Enthusiastically acted and sharply written. A big old lovefest in honor of the classic alien visitation movies that we all hold near and dear.:::1:::3/4
I don't know if I've laughed this hard since "Hot Fuzz".:::1:::None
I suppose, though, that it's the voice of Rogen that eventually becomes grating as the wise-cracking Paul.:::0:::None
The film's central idea isn't funny, really, at all. Neither is the plot, the dialogue, or most of the jokes.:::0:::2/5
This is not quite enough of a conceit to sustain a full-length movie -- Paul would have made a terrific short film -- but there are incidental pleasures all along the way.:::1:::B
A good-hearted, funny movie.:::1:::None
Paul is E.T. and Fanboys mixed together with a lot of pot. It has a few laughs, but I expected more from Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.:::1:::3/5
The results, it must be said, are less hi-larious than sporadically mid-to-low-larious.:::0:::2.5/4
Paul makes going to the movies fun again.:::1:::4/5
In the end - as well as the middle and maybe even at the outset - Paul is more often a close encounter of the middling kind.:::1:::2.5/4
The results are, again, not-quite-brilliant but funny enough.:::1:::B-
The thing that differentiates their humor from a lot of others is that it's free from meanness. They are not making fun of people like Graeme and Clive but rather taking delight in their silly obsessions.:::1:::None
Paul has too much message and profanity - and not enough laughs to make up for either.:::0:::2/5
Beam us up, Scotty. There's no intelligent life here.:::0:::2/4
It doesn't have any of the invention of the pair's last two outings. Overall, Paul is a genial, unremarkable movie that skates by on its charm.:::1:::2.5/4
The "shock" humor slowly smoothes itself out and meshes into the laid-back quality of the story, helped by the sheer presence of the cast.:::1:::3/5
...drowns in geek butter; every scene is stuffed with winks, nods and Easter eggs, a cavalcade of inside jokes, including a honky-tonk band playing Mos Eisley cantina music with fiddles.:::1:::C+
If you've ever stood outside on a cloudless night, gazed up at the stars and wondered if there was life on other planets - and if that life would be fun to do bong hits with - this is your movie.:::1:::3/4
'Paul' is more a bagful of giggles. Rogen is a nonstop hoot, but it's the byplay between Frost and Pegg that roots the laughs in characters we care about.:::1:::3/4
Infused with an appreciation of all things sci-fi ... specifically, all things Steven Spielberg:::1:::3/4
Not on the level of SHAUN OF THE DEAD, or HOT FUZZ, but PAUL is still a whole lot of fun. Kristen Wiig makes an inspired addition to the Pegg/Frost team.:::1:::8/10
What really pushes Paul into the stratosphere is the level of charm and chemistry between its cast members.:::1:::3/5
A reference-laden road trip/chase yukfest that doesn't quite capture that same Spaced magic but is eventually just so likable it is hard to knock its flaws too much.:::1:::3/4
The result is profane, surprisingly affectionate, often scathingly funny and occasionally inspired.:::1:::B+
It's more than occasionally cute, if less than consistently clever.:::0:::2/4
What has happened to Pegg? Why does he mug so? Why can't he relax and let the audience come to him, rather than auditioning for our affection with every reaction shot?:::0:::2/4
Set your humor-detection capacitors for moderate to above-average intake levels. I haven't laughed this much since maybe last Monday, but that was a particularly strong Monday.:::1:::3/4
A celebration of geek culture and silliness that vacillates between lowest common denominator and rewards for those who spend too much time enamored with Star Wars.:::1:::2.5/4
An uneven but amiable road trip sci-fi comedy about an alien with sly references to everything from "Star Trek" and "2001" to "Alien" and "Battlestar Gallactica.":::1:::B+
A film that is entertaining enough to warrant seeing but one that will pretty much fade from your memory by the time you get home from the theatre.:::1:::4/5
While not a breakthrough on the level of Shaun Of The Dead or Hot Fuzz, writer/stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's Paul features an appealingly oddball premise.:::1:::3/5
How could so many talented people collaborate on something so dull?:::0:::1/4
It all launches an E.T. riff that the two Brits would have mocked in their seminal TV series, Spaced.:::0:::2/4
A movie that knows exactly what it is and never tries to overreach. This is an unapologetic goofball romp, nothing more, nothing less:::1:::3.5/4
While Frost is particularly well-cast, most of the actors seem to be having fun. You will, too, as long as you arrive with lowered expectations.:::1:::3/5
I'd recommend it, but I'd also recommend going in with medium-ish expectations.:::1:::2.5/4
Here's a movie that teeters on the edge of being really pretty good and loses its way.:::0:::2.5/4
More in love with its ability to quote an assortment of science-fiction works than to actually find a comic niche of its own.:::0:::2/4
Let's just say that if you have any love for science fiction and fantasy films from the past 40 years you'll certainly enjoy the film.:::1:::3/5
It's vaguely pleasant and never offensive, but also predominately blah.:::0:::2/4
Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have proven once again that there is no genre outside their enviable range or comedic abilities.:::1:::8/10
I wanted to love Paul, but found myself feeling merely infatuated with it instead.:::1:::B
A solid action comedy featuring a standout performance from Seth Rogen [that] will make you wonder how much better it might have been with frequent collaborator Edgar Wright in charge.:::1:::3.5/5
What makes the film largely work, despite its occasional slackness and over-trodden terrain, is its overall affability (and smutty words).:::1:::3.5/5
An agreeable comedy that is likely to be over-inflated to masterpiece status by fanboys.:::1:::B
Most of the laughs in "Paul" are those of recognition ('Get away from her you b*%$,' Gertie's Cafe, Devil' Tower, Star Wars cantina music etc.) than true humor.:::1:::B-
This is a well-made, well-plotted and sensitive movie.:::1:::3/4
After the sharp bite and harsh light of most American-style guy-based funny films today, "Paul" comes as such sweet relief.:::1:::4/5
It's not out of this world, but Paul is just spacey enough to convince us the truth is out there. And buzzed.:::1:::2.5/4
[Pegg and Frost'] successes seem to have functioned as a supermagnet, attracting not only the skilled comedy director Greg Mottola but a supporting cast that could sustain two or three movies on its own.:::1:::None
Think of Paul as a love letter to fanboys, especially the variety that knows the standards well enough to hoot along every time a sci-fi hit rings up a reference.:::1:::B-
Almost every good moment in the film is sandwiched between two bits that aren't nearly as well built.:::0:::C+
Most of it crash-lands.:::0:::1/4
"Paul" embraces sci-fi culture with gleeful abandon. Anybody who catches its "Mac and Me" reference earned their laughter years ago.:::1:::2.5/4
"Paul" gets messy in places and is a bit overlong, but overall it's great fun; so much so that you wonder why the makers of dreary Hollywood comedies don't take a look at this and realize that yes, you can make a funny movie without gross-out humor.:::1:::3/4
Because of the lethargic pace, cheeky jokes become positively jowly. And the easy lampoons of rednecks and bible thumpers beg to be called "Close Encounters of the secondhand.":::0:::2/4
What could have been a keen, witty take on alien-visitation tropes becomes a noisy, strained buddy movie with more lows than highs.:::0:::C
Missteps aside, there are lots of good ideas packed into the movie.:::1:::2.5/4
Not bad, but certainly not good; classify the movie as lazy fun.:::0:::None
The movie's not bad, but in tone, it's a goofy, laid-back B movie, and you should adjust expectations accordingly.:::1:::B
Paul is a little sloppy and a little sappy, but the filmmakers' passion for their subject matter carries it over the occasional rough spot.:::1:::B
Never achieves the exhilarating feat of exemplifying the types of Hollywood movies it wants to unpack. The airline's lost their luggage.:::0:::1.5/4
if there are chuckles to be had along the way, they're the asthmatic, superior kind that Comic Book Guy on "The Simpsons" enjoys.:::0:::1/4
There's simply no cure for the fundamental laziness behind "Paul," which amounts to a recycling program for tired gags about nerds, gays, nervous-nelly Brits, dumbass Yanks and little green men.:::0:::None
a bit of a tepid sci-fi comedy:::0:::3/5
A simple, entertaining road-trip movie that doesn't ask us to do much more than strap in and enjoy the trip.:::1:::3/4
Paul is an irresistible creature thanks to Rogen's deadpan delivery. This pleasant film is more clever than funny, referring to old alien films instead of joking about them.:::1:::None
In its efforts to please those nerds, Hollywood may actually be selling them short with films that have little of the ingenuity that used to be the lifeblood of genre moviemaking.:::0:::3/5
What's funniest about Paul however, is that each of its characters is stunned out of their complacency, right down to a humorous and touching revelation in the climax.:::1:::7/10
Somewhere between high concept and lowbrow humor, "Paul" hits the sweet spot of a genuine heart.:::1:::3/4
Gags and lines are clunky, but the majority of the picture creates a swirling sense of sci-fi devotion, conveyed with a heartfelt tone that makes Paul feel like an elaborate inside joke most audiences should be able to enjoy.:::1:::3/4
Watching Paul makes you wonder whether Edgar Wright wasn't the one who kicked Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's previous films up the notch needed to give them their bite.:::0:::None
An alien encounter would be memorable; Paul is forgotten before you get to the car.:::0:::2.5/4
A celebration of sci-fi flicks, fanboys and good, old-fashioned bromance, "Paul" is a thoroughly enjoyable road trip.:::1:::4/5
Comedies this well put together are the exception, not the rule, and when one comes along with a troupe who pull as many comedic chains as this one does I, for one, stand and applaud it--once my mirth subsides.:::1:::4/5
A frolicsome comedy in which two Englishmen encounter a smart, witty, and gifted extraterrestrial on their pilgrimage to famous UFO sites in America.:::1:::4.5/5
Finds its own shambling, syncopated rhythm.:::1:::B+
The humor is generally in well-traveled terrain with a generous helping of penis jokes, but somehow having it coming out of the mouth of a little green man makes it fresh and ironic.:::1:::4/5
What's frustrating is how consistently the film waffles between the inspired and the inept.:::0:::2/5
its niche specificity celebrates geek culture in a way that it seems like few mainstream viewers will identify with, unfortunately overshadowing what is an otherwise imperfect but funny and genuinely sweet story.:::1:::None
Paul is like all those comedies I used to like, the kind where they were just plain good.:::1:::None
A sweet, likable little movie that allows its supporting cast to outshine the stars.:::1:::3.5/5
That's not to dismiss Paul's simple pleasures -- if nothing else, its fondness for sex and drugs and four-letter words rescues its references from the soft hands of wee ones into which they've fallen of late.:::1:::None
While not as cohesive as Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's previous genre riffs, this rambling alien road comedy has its own loose, enjoyable vibe.:::1:::None
What happened here?:::0:::None
Nostalgia is both an advantage and disadvantage in Greg Mottola's Paul, a loving lampoon of geek culture and an homage to the films of the Spielberg/Lucas revolution.:::1:::3/5
Geek is its own language, and Paul speaks it fluently.:::1:::2.5/4
Unlike the movies its creators love and are paying homage to here, Paul is one big goof.:::1:::B
It's a good thing Paul was written from a place of love, as it is absolutely the death knell for geek chic.:::1:::B-
It's C-minus work from people who normally deliver A-level efforts.:::0:::2.5/5
The innate in-ness has a tendency to tip over into self-indulgence, but at other times it's easy to get swept up in what is essentially a pretty amiable road trip comedy.:::1:::None
An intergalactic grossout road movie subverting the sci-fi genre, and reimagined as an alien voyage into the extreme nuttiness of Middle America. And where Paul seems to be the only sensible fugitive on board, in a sea of mutually terrifying earthlings.:::1:::None
Nearly everyone involved in Paul has been part of some kind of comedic masterpiece, which may be why I can't help wishing this perfectly good movie had gotten a little closer to being great.:::1:::3/5
The film delivers laughs and heart and some strong ideas and energy...:::1:::None
Having so much talent involved in making a comedy that's not particularly funny is quite disappointing.:::0:::6/10
[F]unny. And sweet. And fearless, in small ways that wouldn't stand out if most mainstream movies weren't so damned cowardly in so many big ways. It's a total nerd fantasy...:::1:::None
A disappointment from start to finish, Greg Mottola's alien spoof comedy is dead on arrival.:::0:::C-
Sure it's clever, but clever never actually amounts to laughter...:::0:::None
Part bromance, part sci-fi spoof and all a bit disappointing.:::0:::None
Next to Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, Paul does feel flat, although Pegg and Frost paper over the cracks with nods and winks to classic fantasy and sci-fi films.:::1:::None
There is quite a bit to chuckle at if you have a more sophisticated sense of humour, but this film really is E.T. remade for not-quite-grown-ups.:::1:::3/5
It might not quite hit the high notes of Shaun Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz, but their many dedicated fans will find plenty of satisfying laughs in Pegg and Frost's latest.:::1:::3/5
Pegg and Frost shouldn't be wasting their combined talents on such disposable fare.:::0:::2/5
A lazy piece of geeksploitation cinema designed to buttress the Pegg/Frost brand Stateside with Comic Con-courting cliches and groan-inducing movie references.:::0:::2/5
Packed with sci-fi in-jokes, the picture is more gently amusing than hilarious and the characters, while likeable, are hardly the most fascinating or complex.:::1:::3/5
Pro-evolution debate aside for now, which is "kind of a buzz kill", on the whole, Paul beams feel-good fun, cheekiness and carefree spirit.:::1:::4/5
An affectionate comic pastiche of ET-type science fiction pictures.:::1:::None
Broader and more accessible than either Shaun Of The Dead or Hot Fuzz, Paul is pure Pegg and Frost - clever, cheeky and very, very funny.:::1:::4/5
Get a load of this: Paul smokes marijuana cigarettes, has jumbo-sized naughty bits and keeps making jokes about probing bums! Goodness gracious me. Pass the smelling salts, Aunt Jemima.:::0:::2/5
Fondly indulgent rather than inspired, breezy but broad and indicative of treasured talents coasting.:::1:::3/5
The writing skill of Edgar Wright of Hot Fuzz and Shaun is badly missed. It isn't a failure, but it's by no means a success.:::1:::3/5
That rarest of specimens: a genuinely funny geek-friendly comedy.:::1:::4/5
From time to time, clever ideas rear their heads, but they soon return to the film's default setting of laddish japes.:::0:::2/5
It doesn't have the same charm as Shaun and Fuzz but this is one of the funniest films in ages and is hugely entertaining.:::1:::4/5
The problem is self-indulgence and a distinct shortage of real gags.:::0:::2/5
Its funniest single line is a reference to the incest documentary Capturing the Friedmans. If nothing in that last sentence makes any sense to you, stay well away.:::0:::2/5
Although there are laughs along the way and Pegg and Frost have an easy on-screen camaraderie, there's a smugness that prevents them from achieving their potential.:::0:::2/5
Although Superbad's Greg Mottola doesn't have the fs Paquin's character with more guilt than most anyone could bear, much less a less-than-steady-on-her-feet teen, the film lets some great performances and compelling moments drift in a sea of shapelessness.:::0:::C
I wish I could say it's a resurrected classic but, alas, it's mostly a mess -- a 2-1/2-hour mess no less.:::0:::C
Like the final notes of an opera, the film lingers, inviting you back to explore its mysteries a second and even a third time.:::1:::None
Precisely imagined, far-reaching portrait of a teenager coping with the fallout of a tragic accident.:::1:::None
Every bold vision requires respect; a few deserve celebration. This is one of them, imperfections and all.:::1:::4/5
For a 90-minute movie, "Margaret" has a thin story. So it's unfortunate that it runs 2 1/2 hours.:::0:::2.5/4
Lonergan has created a forceful yet extremely fitful film that teases with moments of brilliance only to frustrate in the end.:::0:::2/5
"Margaret" was filmed in 2005 and has reportedly been delayed because of persistent editing problems. These do not seem to have been solved.:::0:::2/5
Lonergan didn't bite off more than he could chew with Margaret - this is his personal moral gymnasium - but he did bite off more than others might want to chew.:::1:::None
A pretentious, talky bore that feels like an amalgamation of workshopped theater ideas thrown at the wall in the hopes that any one of them will stick.:::0:::None
See it, goggle at its strangeness, marvel at how a movie can be haunting even when it doesn't work at all.:::1:::3/5
It feels like a film that's been years in the making, and something this rich is worth the wait.:::1:::8/10
"Margaret" remains tantalizingly unfulfilled.:::0:::2.5/4
It's easy to see the years of frustration on screen in this plodding, overstuffed and fatally self-important coming of age story.:::0:::2/5
Rarely has a film with such a great cast and so many moments of terrific writing and such high dramatic goals been so messy and disorganized and fundamentally bad.:::0:::None
Lonergan's dialogue can sweep you up in a whoosh of personality and ideas, but it's hard to see what, apart from ego, convinced him that this story was so epic.:::1:::B-
This unwieldy drama of conscience in the wake of tragedy is hyperarticulate but rarely eloquent, full of wrenchingly acted scenes that lack credible motivation or devolve into shrill hectoring.:::0:::None
From start to end credits, very much an example of good work that doesn't translate.:::0:::2/4
Nearly every scene is acutely observed, a strong cast fully inhabiting Lonergan's symphonic collision of ideas and in tune with his ear for the harsh poetry of New York language, variously hyperbolic and sparing, engaged and self-protective.:::1:::None
A distanced but often car-crash compelling portrait of a teen as an unfinished being.:::1:::None
The film has a cumulative power -- solidified by a devastating opera-house finale -- that's staggering. This is frayed-edges filmmaking at its finest.:::1:::5/5
This is the first bad movie that has ever made me call for a sequel -- to get it all right.:::0:::None
:::0:::2/5
:::0:::None
Priest is one of those films you will forget about approximately five minutes after it's over. There is absolutely nothing memorable here.:::0:::3/10
The good news is that Priest is not nearly as painful to sit through as Legion. But that's about it for the good news.:::0:::1/5
'Priest' is about five beads shy of a rosary.:::0:::1.5/4
Priest is a lousy action movie with boring characters, a convoluted plot, and, most unforgivable, very little compelling action.:::0:::1/5
"Priest" is one of those films you will forget about approximately five minutes after it's over. There is absolutely nothing memorable or noteworthy about it:::0:::1.5/4
anyone who has seen the trailer has seen a good 80% of anything worth watching here:::0:::2.5/5
90 minutes of inconsequential action and cliche recycling...painful to watch a semi-interesting setup get squandered and become stuffed into a familiar-as-hell framework where nothing ever seems at stake.:::0:::1/4
An ugly exercise in genre filmmaking and religion bashing, Priest marks a new low in the action/horror hybrid, and once again proves why Paul Bettany is the worst action star working today.:::0:::1.5/5
Bettany is a great actor who does melancholy very well, he also has a sense of mischief. It would be nice to see it shine a bit before it, too, fades to grey.:::0:::2/5
Its visual style veers between bleached desert tones and slimy undercover dankness, but the 3D version is undistinguished.:::0:::2/5
Some scenes on the train have a certain chill, but overall this is likely to short-change genre lovers.:::0:::1.5/5
At the very least, the film's herky-jerky mood swings will keep viewers on their toes long after they become bored with the main plot.:::0:::2/5
What's not to like about badass Catholic vigilantes who fly through the air to punch demons in the face? (Don't answer that.):::1:::3/5
Predictable action sequences & lazy character development add up to an all too blatant cash in at the box office:::0:::None
Vampires, cowboys and warrior priests: an unholy mess.:::0:::1.5/5
Priest 3D might be of interest for those keen on the comics but for others it's a very loud and chaotic but lame fantasy effort with much mayhem but insufficient payoff.:::0:::None
Director Scott Stewart has fun with the genre, making effective use of 3D technology and amid the ridiculous, delivers an often surprisingly compelling B-movie with some superior elements.:::1:::None
...as dull and intolerable an actioner as one can easily recall...:::0:::1/4
There's an overriding sense that many aspects of the movie have either been shockingly underdeveloped... or left on the cutting room floor.:::0:::2/5
Priest is the sort of movie you walk into knowing full well its IQ is significantly less than the bucket of popcorn balanced in your lap...:::0:::2/10
That's what churches are for... get in a man's way (especially when he needs to kill a horde of vampires).:::1:::2.5/4.0
A poorly conceived, pointless exercise in genre filmmaking.:::0:::1/4
A sort of futuristic fantasy western with 'The Searchers' as its granddad, 'Priest' is an action adventure that will attract fans of the graphic novel and folks who like fantasy in general.:::0:::2/4
It's great-looking but lifeless.:::0:::2/5
it is effective within its own terms:::0:::None
The inspiration may be John Ford and the credited source may be a Korean comic book, but it resembles one of producer Roger Corman's 1980s 'Mad Max' rip-offs, pumped up with charmless and overbusy 21st-century digital effects.:::0:::2/4
These vampires are bestial-looking, eyeless, fanged somethings that look like...Gollum on crystal meth.:::0:::1.5/5
Creepy, pulpy and shamelessly derivative sci-fi.:::0:::4/10
Bettany exudes an intensity that lays the groundwork for an interesting character, but Priest hasn't a prayer of creating anything more subtle than the giant cross tattooed on his face.:::0:::2/5
The po-faced filmmaking and acting only highlights how unoriginal it is, from production design to music to action sequences:::0:::1.5/5
You sit in your theater seat imagining how much better it would be if it were rated R and garnished with tons more vampire violence and digital death.:::0:::1.5/5
It's a lot of talky-talky and very little smashy-smashy.:::0:::1.5/5
The parallels between Priest and The Searchers are extensive, and spotting them provides some fun in what might otherwise be a pretty dismal experience.:::0:::2/5
As happens with big-screen comics, the dialogue fizzles at times. But mostly this is a delicious mash-up of styles and genres: gothic, steampunk, Wild West, martial arts, dystopian fun.:::1:::2.5/4
Priest is so not a good movie. In fact, it's a pretty bad one, but it's also the most fun I've had at a bad movie for some considerable time.:::0:::2.5/5
yet another in a long line of dim, contrasty postmodern stews that appeal to a particularly dark, pseudo-Gothic sensibility, but probably not to anyone else, including those who enjoy the various genres from which it steals.:::0:::1.5/4
The God of Aborted Franchises will be pleased.:::0:::2/5
It may not be great, but it's pure, and it deserved better.:::1:::3/4
Same old same old about humans fighting vampires in a futuristic society - been there done that. Still the movie does have good action and a nice performance by Paul Bettany.:::0:::5/10
In all of this utterly dispiriting, ill-written and spastically-directed tripe, there is one bright spot, and that is Karl Urban as the villain.:::0:::2/10
"Priest'' is based on a series of Korean graphic novels. What it's really based on, though, is other movies - a whole lot of other movies.:::0:::2/4
So bad it's almost good...almost.:::0:::1/4
Priest could never live up to its geek cool promise:::0:::2.5/5
If you've watched any of the trailers, they make about as much sense as the full feature does.:::0:::1/5
High production values and slick editing can't save this picture. Nor does its overbearing soundtrack music, which tries to strong-arm viewers into believing they're watching a pulse-pounding thriller.:::0:::1/4
A mash-up of vampire horror and period westerns stewed with Blade Runner cityscapes and ridiculous religious images in a bubbling cauldron of dumb ideas and sinfully bad dialogue.:::0:::0.5/4
Things progress in a thoroughly cliched manner:::0:::2/5
After a strong beginning, Priest ends with a whiff of Jonah Hex about it.:::0:::2/4
If you have an action movie that doesn't have enough loud, wham-bam, explosive fun to wake a sleeping baby, which was the case at my screening, then you, my friend, have an action movie not worth seeing.:::0:::D
The action's fairly toothless, and the abrupt, anemic ending promises a sequel. The filmmakers will have to pray pretty hard for that miracle.:::0:::C
Another broad yet eclectic little genre-blender to toss into your rental queue.:::1:::3/5
I guess you could call it a guilty pleasure.:::1:::6/10
Too good-looking to be dismissed entirely, not bad enough to be worthy of outright scorn, but not good enough to watch, either.:::0:::C
The film, based in name only on a series of South Korean graphic novels, has nice, washed-out desert exteriors and some cool jet-powered motorcycles, but there's nothing in the hackneyed story or the derivative action scenes to make you take notice.:::0:::2/5
The whole thing -- which in less than an hour-and-a-half manages to insult Catholics, Native Americans, John Wayne fans and anybody with two I.Q. points to spare -- all climaxes in a lot of fire and smoke and CGI explosions.:::0:::1/4
The film is somehow a disappointing combo of too-full and oddly empty.:::0:::2/5
I liked Priest, and I wouldn't much mind any of these characters returning.:::1:::7.5/10
A soulless sci-fi thriller about crucifix-tattooed warriors battling vampires, Priest is too serious to be any fun.:::0:::D
While I hardly hold Priest 3D sacred, I'm not throwing holy water on it and casting it out, either. It's fine, as long as you're fine with adequate horror actioners.:::0:::None
When you watch Bettany, you can't help wondering why the hell a talented actor is stuck in such an ungodly mess.:::0:::None
In the way it unimaginatively regurgitates familiar genre elements in service of preachy piousness, director Scott Charles Stewart's cinema is the equivalent of Christian rock.:::0:::1/4
At $12.75 a movie ticket, you might be better off buying the comic book.:::0:::1/5
[If] you're looking for a diverting sci-fi actioner that handily mixes the DNA of several different movies, with a few flying crosses thrown in and a heavy dose of Western mythology, sink your teeth in.:::1:::3/5
There are some nifty touches in the big city sequences ... but the vampire-heavy scenes are nearly incomprehensible.:::0:::2.5/5
Adapted from a graphic-novel series (and what isn't these days?), this unholy mess of horror and Western cliches is, at least, blessed with a wonderfully loony premise.:::0:::C-
It's admirable how a movie with so many obvious influences and references can offer an experience that still feels like its own thing.:::1:::7/10
Lately, it feels like there are two things you can count on in a Screen Gems movie. 1) It will suck. 2) It will feature Cam Gigandet. And he will suck.:::0:::None
The simplistic directness of its storytelling is refreshing. It's as if the filmmakers realize they're wasting everyone's time, so they at least want to take up as little of it as possible.:::0:::D+
Maybe I'm giving the filmmakers too much credit, but I'd like to believe there was once more to Priest than the tedious, hollow, joyless jumble that's presented here:::0:::1.5/4
Priest's shortcomings should not really come as a surprise. Previously, Stewart directed the equally lame Legion, which also mixed religion and demonic creatures.:::0:::None
Its truncated running time suggests that a huge amount of it was left on the cutting room floor.:::0:::C-
A surprisingly effective piece of genre filmmaking, littered with flaws but none so glaring as to sink the film as a whole.:::1:::3/5
It just makes me sad to think director Scott Stewart and all the artists under him had high ambitions and substantial resources... for this.:::0:::None
They could have called this one 'Something Borrowed' because everything feels lifted from other films.:::0:::3/10
Bettany has little character and the 3D effects are appalling.:::0:::1/5
...society is protected by a band of licensed-to-kill clergy who power up with prayer and shoot cross-shaped ninja stars.:::1:::A-
An irritating, lifeless experience, so bad it sucks the fun right out of moviegoing.:::0:::0.5/4
Already seems this aggressively B-level entertainment will quickly wither and disappear in the face of Hollywood's A-level events.:::0:::2.5/5
On a visceral level, Priest offers enough action and cool bits to probably hold the interest of most 14-year-old boys, but its hodgepodge story and overall derivative nature make it feel like a movie that should have come out back in the '90s.:::0:::2 1/2 stars
The over-optimistic promise of a sequel will hopefully be one premise which remains dead and buried. For ever and ever. Amen.:::0:::1/5
In an era where monster mythology has become raw material for all sorts of mediocrity, Priest is one of the best examples of a broad-scale vampire blockbuster.:::1:::3/5
[E]ven though it's easy to point out how derivative it is in a lot of ways, it's also sort of thrilling in how spare and clean and unself-conscious it is about itself...:::1:::None
A melange of apocalyptic western, gothic horror and vampire action movie, Priest won't win any awards for originality. Still, it's streamlined and executed well enough to earn a tip of the cap from those in its target demo.:::1:::2.5/5
At best, Priest is a passable time-waster. Mostly, it's like watching an extended Gorillaz video.:::0:::2/5
Doesn't have a prayer.:::0:::None
Not exactly an unholy mess, but still a rather too pious retread of classic sci-fi/action/horror riffs that lacks originality or pizzazz.:::0:::None
Did Paul Bettany know, when he donned the cowl of the albino monk in 'The Da Vinci Code', that he would soon be typecast as Hollywood's go-to guy for God-bothering multiplex action movies?:::0:::2/5
Paul Bettany in a cassock with a cross biroed on to his forehead, potholing with virm directorial grip of the pair's usual collaborator, Edgar Wright, for the most part this is a far-out, funny ride.:::1:::3/5
Smart and savvy.:::1:::None
An enjoyable, well written sci-fi comedy that's packed with great gags, geek-pleasing film references and a host of terrific performances from a talented comic cast.:::1:::4/5
Simon Pegg and Nick Frost in a faltering extraterrestrial knockabout.:::0:::1/5
There are plenty of giggly gags but also a hint of diminishing returns.:::1:::3/5
This isn't one for the ages, but it'll do for a Saturday night.:::1:::3/5
The bromance between Pegg and Frost is still as strong as ever, and Kristen Wiig steals the show with her turn as a religious fanatic freed from her fundamentalist shackles.:::1:::3/5
A sci-fi spoof for everyone with funny encounters that will require close attention.:::1:::None
A decent take on the usual Pegg/Frost bromance, and a welcome return to the level of geekery that plays to their strengths, Paul entertains without excelling.:::1:::3/5
The hiccups of comedy genius feel like hollow victories in a generally average film.:::0:::2/5
Though it's not on a par with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's best work, it's hard to imagine anybody not enjoying it.:::1:::3.5/5
:::1:::3.5/5
A watchable and satisfying family film.:::1:::3.0/5
When I was in high school, I would have pretended like this movie was beneath me, that it's just about stupid prom. That's sort of what high school is about too. But I secretly would have loved it.:::1:::B
Wholesome story, colorful characters and sweet romantic elements, make for a decent watch.:::1:::7/10
...a perfectly watchable - albeit utterly forgettable - little drama...:::1:::2.5/4
There's one hell of a drinking game to be made for every utterance of title word.:::0:::2/4
If Disney missed the bulls-eye this time, they still hit the target (audience).:::1:::7/10
Pretty much a non-starter...its squeaky-cleanliness will seem more at home in its inevitable cable afterlife on the Disney channel. [Blu-ray]:::0:::2/4
[At least] it doesn't get mired in the '80s nostalgia that's come to infect today's teen comedies...:::0:::1.5/4
teen drama that may be feel-good, but lets itself down by merely going through the motions.:::0:::2/5
It's the kind of thing that gives sincerity a bad name.:::0:::None
With a squeaky-clean, smiling multi-ethnic cast, Prom gives a non-musical nod to Glee but doesn't dare address the same awkward teen issues that have made the show so popular.:::1:::3/5
This Disney fare is so bland and unremarkable that you might be better off staying home and watching a repeat of Glee.:::0:::2/5
As sanitised teen movies go, Prom is a scoop of sugar-free vanilla ice-cream resting on a gluten-free wafer that was manufactured in a completely sterile environment.:::0:::None
Only moderately exasperating.:::0:::2/5
Romance flowering or being dashed, a school where no one appears to be doing any coherent work and a Prom which brings the whole messy thing towards its feelgood finish.:::0:::2/5
As high-school movies go, Prom isn't the coolest kid in class, but an appealing cast ensures that the film's sweetness and good-humour will go down well with tweens, even if their older siblings find proceedings a little too safe and insipid.:::1:::None
Even younger viewers would surely relish a little more raunch. It's hard to hate, however, and parents can take confidence in the fact that it could never be accused of being a corrupting influence.:::0:::2/5
Horribly cheesy in parts, it's fairly amusing in others and you may quite enjoy it if you're a 12-year-old girl. Everyone else should steer clear.:::0:::2/5
If you're looking for a DVD for your tweenie sleepover, then here is the movie for you: a bland, Disney drama about all the heartache and craziness leading up to a high school graduation prom night.:::0:::2/5
It's an orgy of good, clean fun (no swearing, no booze and definitely no fooling around) without one single original cinematic moment.:::0:::2/5
It's all so sugar-coated and sanitised that there's nothing here for the over-12s.:::0:::2/5
Inhabits Glee and High School Musical territory without mustering their wit or creativity.:::0:::2/5
Occasionally, it's mildly amusing but the conclusions are so soft it hurts.:::0:::2/5
You couldn't loathe the experience, however vacuous it feels. Prom does have some hot new talent to watch, for example, Cameron Monaghan, Nicholas Braun and Thomas McDonell.:::0:::2/5
Not knowing enough for the Glee/Easy A generation and laden with enough Prom-movie cliches to have older viewing running for the exits, it's old hat.:::0:::2/5
It's what some parents might call "good clean fun". Just without the "good" and "fun" bits.:::0:::2/5
... predictably sweet and sweetly predictable.:::1:::3/5
The classic teen movies tend to resonate more with actual teens, but while high schoolers may find this movie unbelievably innocuous, it's a sweet enough diversion for young'uns and the parents who have to accompany them.:::0:::2.5/5
Prom turns what could have been a string of punch lines and lump-in-the-throat passages into an affecting group portrait.:::1:::2.5/4
Somewhere around the midway point I couldn't help but think that a bucket of pig blood would liven things up to no end.:::0:::2/5
A Disney-esque sanitized version of the Prom phenom, but what's wrong with that?:::1:::6/10
Compulsively ordinary.:::0:::None
Prom is pretty much precisely what you expect: kids fret and adults miss points, and eventually, prom is over.:::0:::None
In the way that a real prom will start with everyone standing around staring at each other but end with a crowded dance floor, Prom starts to pick up steam as it goes along.:::1:::2.5/5
Except for a couple of nice touches, "Prom" is a remedial class in cliches.:::0:::2/4
It's harmless. It's also hopeless and ultimately, pointless.:::0:::5.5/10
Prom is a good-hearted, perfectly watchable bonbon about adolescents with little on their minds besides who will ask or be asked to the graduation night shindig.:::1:::None
Here's a rare bird: a film made for "tweens" that actually takes young people and their emotions seriously, instead of playing them for cheap laughs. What's more, Prom won't make parents cringe by exposing their children to characters who...:::1:::None
They're a ridiculously cute pair and ridiculously at odds over this whole prom thingy, which is, by its very nature, ridiculous. So the ridiculous quotient is extremely high.:::0:::2/4
Unrealistic prom flick is bland for teens, fine for tweens.:::0:::2/5
If your child is in Grade 9, I can pretty much guarantee they're too jaded and cynical for a movie in which blemish-free twentysomething actors enthuse about how prom night will be the most IMPORTANT NIGHT OF MY LIFE, OMG!:::0:::2/5
Perhaps the biggest problem with Prom is that there is nothing special about it. Everything feels familiar and rehashed, like eating leftovers that have lingered in the fridge and been picked at for days.:::0:::1.5/4
Never have the stakes seemed so low for everyone involved. This is a sterile high school environment, lacking anything nearing controversy.:::0:::C-
It will give its intended tween audience a lot to squeal about -- and leave their parents reminiscing quietly about how good films from '80s icon John Hughes were.:::0:::2.5/4
Less engrossing than a Clearasil commercial and more synthetic than a Rebecca Black video.:::0:::2/4
This is a Disney flick, complete with an ensemble of Mouseketeers doing their level best to be the Muzak of kids -- any resemblance to an actual teenager is purely accidental.:::0:::2/4
Because I'm a thousand years old now, I realize that a lot of high school rituals have probably changed since I was there. But I do not remember anything resembling the baroque pageantry of "The Ask" techniques in this movie.:::0:::2.5/5
I think people who would go to a movie named "Prom" are going to like the movie named "Prom.":::1:::2.5/4
She's a conformist overachiever, he's a troubled soul; a third-grader could tell that the two will fall hard for each other by the movie's halfway point.:::0:::2/4
For a work so seemingly light and straightforward, this is an astonishingly inept, curiously depressing experience.:::0:::1.5/4
"Prom" is so strenuously inoffensive it makes Disney's "High School Musical" look almost racy by comparison.:::0:::2/4
A movie that's so anachronistically mushy and awkward, it earns extra credit simply for being so innocent.:::0:::2/5
Director Joe Nussbaum's movie comes from promising first-time screenwriter Katie Wech. Her work has a nice spirit; "Prom" may be the same old thing, and squeaky-clean to the point of mild-to-moderate aggravation, but it's not pushy.:::1:::2.5/4
There are new tweeners every year. To them, the characters and plot devices in this perfectly competent film might well seem fresh.:::1:::3/5
You certainly don't expect a Disney live-action movie to be ambitious or edgy, but you don't necessarily expect this degree of sloppiness either.:::0:::None
Adults will yawn, having seen this movie (and possibly lived it) a few times, but for its 11- to 16-year-old target audience, it'll be exactly right.:::1:::2.5/4
Basically, it's "When Hilary Duff Met 1993 Eddie Vedder.":::0:::2/4
