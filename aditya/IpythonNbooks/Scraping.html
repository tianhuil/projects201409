      <th>'Til There Was You</th>
      <td> I had mixed feelings about the slow ride, but one thing is certain: This film could have been a lot stronger if it was a lot simpler.  It tries for fizzy, but there's hardly a bubble in it.  When will someone realize that sexy Sarah Jessica Parker is pure comic gold and start writing movies that give her a chance to glisten? She's the only spice in this too-sweet romantic comedy.  Very little is amusing in all of this; the lighting is murky, the sound is mumbly, and will someone please tell the piano player to knock it off?  Alas, first-time director Scott Winant and screenwriter Winnie Holzman rarely get beyond the cuteness of the story's structure.  Its stars, young, sexy performers all, deserve a better vehicle.  I was not surprised to discover in the press notes that the movie ''has a touch of autobiography.'' The film's irritating insistence on parading its sensitivity gave the game away.  The woeful miscasting of Jeanne Tripplehorn sabotages this romantic comedy about two people who are destined to meet but who contrive to keep missing each other.  Coincidence follows coincidence as the story moves predictably toward its pre-determined ending. But not before Winant and Holzman parade an annoying array of thinly drawn eccentrics and weirdos across the screen by way of fleshing things out.  Sometimes funny but often plodding.  'Til There Was You is a rarity -- a film in which absolutely nothing works. Nothing. Not one redeeming performance. Not one convincing moment. Not one solid laugh.  Bad romantic comedies with sappy characters aren't always without merit, since we cynics can at least use them to further our conviction that love isn't worth the trouble. But this bad romantic comedy is merely bad.  Graceless star Tripplehorn -- who's called upon to execute a painful series of pratfalls in a high-tech restaurant -- is not a natural comedian, and overall the movie is awkward and leaden.  With its clotted script, art direction that's all splash and no style, and dialogue that's too nakedly calculated to facilitate identification), this tedious and confused movie points several characters in obvious directions.  A tired piece of romantic cornball fare that harks back to a bygone era, the film is a badly conceived, poorly executed fairy tale guaranteed to make audiences squirm in their seats.  The film's real irony is that Gwen and Nick are so annoying that they deserve each other.  The end credits couldn't have come any sooner  This is a fluffy, delightful romantic comedy in the same vein as Sleepless in Seattle.  Tripplehorn and McDermott are likable enough in their roles, but Holzman's precious, overwritten script gives them few genuinely honest moments.  The payoff, such as it is, is distressingly anticlimactic, and results in frustration.  Here is the most tiresome and affected movie in many a moon, a 114-minute demonstration of the Idiot Plot, in which everything could be solved with a few well-chosen words that are never spoken.  pure plastic, flat and transparent. All involved were all too obviously aiming for another ``Sleepless In Seattle,'' but what they've produced is a cinematic siesta.  A big waste of time.  Like most episodic tales, some episodes are better than others; but even the good ones aren't as fully developed as they might be.  With dialog like this why did the producers go forward with this project? The movie needs a rewrite and a new director.  The fatal flaw comes with the casting of the romantic leads, and for once the problem isn't that they don't belong together. You're just not likely to care one way or the other.  A fragmentary and amateurish fairy tale.  When you combine the film's tedious length with questionable casting decisions (Parker disappoints, and Jennifer Aniston plays a surgeon(!?)) you get a fine mess that eventually redeems itself... just not all the way.  Tripplehorn and McDermott don't look as if they belong together and aren't strong enough actors to overcome their physical incompatibility. So there's no sense of urgency about them getting together.  Even if they never met, nothing about this movie would be different except the last two or three minutes. Not exactly a ringing example of great writing or involving direction.  It is so poorly executed that if you didn't know going in that these two were supposed to meet, you'd never figure out what the movie is about.  This film is as messy as its lead character Gwen's (Tripplehorn) personal life.  The studio left this alleged romantic comedy sitting on the shelf for a year -- and it didn't improve with age.  </td>

      <th>10 Items or Less</th>
      <td> Silberling has shot what feels like the first home movie to get a national release; it's too cute to criticize for anything other than its fluff.  While Freeman and Vega are mildly entertaining, the story is too safe and precious to elicit anything more than a passing sense of amusement.  A Hollywood hotshot played by Morgan Freeman, befriends a supermarket cashier just so he can get familiar enough with acting like somebody poor, to get into character for his next movie, and the effort fails miserably.  This is a dazzling piece of character study, set to a breezy, charming tone.  filled with tiny moments that are instantly amusing, then immediately forgotten when the movie's over.  It's ultra low-key as only indie films can be, but there's enough charm and warmth to fill the spaces left by the 'missing' action.  This slight piece of work, written and directed by Brad ilberling, has some amusing moments and thanks to the great chemistry between Freeman and Vega is perhaps more enjoyable than it should be.  ...worth discovering, and it can be discovered by each person who watches it, no matter how many reviews are read, no matter how many friends see it and recommend it. It's just that kind of movie.  ...Rachman's film makes the case that under the right circumstances anger and outrage and defiance are an art form unto themselves.  So often the bearer of gravitas and dignity, Freeman shows up with a smirk on his face and a song in his heart  10 Items or Less is a cinematic smoothie: refreshing, light, insubstantial.  Will go down as tasty as a fast-food guacamole.  As slight as it is wholly disarming.  This is a sharp little slice of whimsy with Freeman giving a funny, very laid-back and sometimes touching performance.  As modest and indie-ish as you can get with the delightfulMorgan Freeman flirting with the lovely Paz Vega.  A light-hearted and feel-good independent film about two strangers who connect in a way that surprises both of them and enriches their lives: it's one of the best films of the year.  [Morgan] Freeman is clearly enjoying himself, but his charisma and heavyweight presence can't quite redeem this featherweight concoction.  From executive producer Morgan Freeman comes a movie about how awesome it would be to have world-famous actor Morgan Freeman be your friend for a day.  It all feels like an insubstantial short that's been stretched to the breaking point.  Freeman and Paz winningly play off each other.  In its own low-key way, 10 Items or Less is completely satisfying, and as a showcase for a great veteran actor and a gifted young actress, it's essential viewing.  The bare-boned simplicity of 10 Items or Less is more a strength than a liability.  [Brad Silberling is] Frank Capra without the edge.  ...Strictly remainder-bin material.  He and Scarlet, in another movie, might have found a way to spin their one day's worth of intimacy into something more movie-like, but here, they keep it contained.  Every potentially worthwhile or amusing moment in writer-director Brad Silberling's 10 Items or Less could be told in 10 minutes or less, with credits included.  Granted, Freeman is essentially playing a variation of himself, while Vega is mining her spunky screen persona. But they deliver.  The film is brief, thin and anecdotal. Yet at its heart is a loving look at an artist at work, and that artist is Morgan Freeman.  ...Best described as an "in-betweener" -- a no-budget, often experimental project that directors and actors sneak in between real jobs.  An amiable demonstration of how two charismatic actors and a relaxed writer-director (Brad Silberling) can squeeze an enjoyable movie out of practically nothing...  It's a sweet, calculated two-hander starring someone you know very well and someone you've never heard of but probably should...  It's hard to convey how completely charming this off-the-cuff, 82-minute movie is. Morgan Freeman, who is 69 years old and has possibly never given a poor performance, is at full-glow here.  Completely weightless but also unpretentious and enjoyable in a relaxed way.  10 Items or Less doesn't insist much more than the average indie exercise, but it's nicely made by Silberling, and if you've lost faith in Morgan Freeman, this is the film to restore it.  It's just a little film that strives to be likable, and is less so than it might have been.  Brad Silberling's new movie has nothing to prove, and not all that much to say, but its modesty and good humor make it hard to resist.  A ridiculous but cheerful toss-off...amusing and charming.  This is a movie of such consummate good cheer that it's difficult to walk away without feeling happier than when it began.  10 Items or Less is a good-natured but failed experiment in meeting cute -- indie-movie style.  With a less camera-friendly duo, this movie could have been a real dud. Even so, it's nothing much. It does have the great virtue of being only 82 minutes long, though.  A partially successful attempt at deflating Freeman's avuncular late-career image.  Silberling demonstrates an unerring ear for the natural, often discomfiting rhythm of two strangers tentatively forging a connection.  These two loners both need to kick their life back into gear, and it's pleasant to watch them spend a day together and gain the strength to do it.  A film about nothing should at least be interesting, and while Morgan Freeman has done some great things in the past, this is just about his mugging for the camera, and unless you're going to be his stalker, that's not something one should be willing to  Slender as the script is %u2013 in both heft and ambition %u2013 it's hard to resist Freeman when he seems to be having such a good time sending himself up.  Insubstantial as dandelion fluff, this is a strange, muzzy little movie made palatable by Freeman's enormously charming, gliding presence.  This sale is void.  Ten Items or Less is not landmark cinema nor is it deeply thought-provoking, but it's smart, funny, knowledgeable about life and people, and a crowd-pleaser.  Slight and wispy, it's a film that could only work with the gracious presence of someone like Morgan Freeman , who delivers an amiably laid-back performance.  10 Items or Less adds up to zilch.  Morgan Freeman has been playing tough-as-nails action stars for such a long time that it's a delight to see him so loose and easy.  10 Items or Less is a hybrid of Nacho Libre and Spanglish directed by Moonlight Mile's Brad Silberling, and yes, it's as unbearably cloying and uplifting as that description sounds.  It's inexcusable to have the best actor in American film today, Morgan Freeman, play in such an underwhelming and amteurish endeavor.  ...thoroughly satisfying...  A charmer in the truest sense of the term by getting to watch Freeman break out and have a lot of fun alongside one of the most beautiful and exciting actresses hopefully starting to get her due in America.  Not really worth checking out.  The fact that 10 Items has a 72-minute playing time before credits (containing the seemingly obligatory outtake montage) only points to how slight it really is.  </td>

      <th>10 Things I Hate About You</th>
      <td> Steeped in a smartness and sincerity becoming of its Shakespearean roots.  A good but patchy romantic comedy, 10 Things I Hate About You does not break new ground, but there are plenty of surprises that will insure a good watch.  ...a slightly above average teenage romcom.  Takes an old story and proves the themes are timeless by applying them to a modern setting.  Gil Junger's TV roots are revealed in his excessive reliance on close-ups and the cast's preponderance of TV actors.  It sounds awful, but Junger's movie is utterly winning.  At times the pic doesn't even seem certain which decade it's set in; the squeaky-clean high school environs often feel more '80s than '90s.  Stiles grows into her character and Ledger is effortlessly charming.  Of all the teen films released this year, this one is, by far, the best.  Pure of heart and perfectly executed.  The largely unknown cast sparkles.  Stiles nails her feminazi, bound-for-Sarah Lawrence shtick, but just as easily melts into giggles or pulls off a slapstick drunk scene.  Unlike many high school movies, 10 Things contains actors who are able to rise above the silly stereotypes and give their characters life.  The movie wimped out by blanding down the story and the characters to the point where she isn't really a shrew and he isn't really a maniac.  The notion of a contemporary high school as a hotbed of romantic intrigue is utterly apt, and the performances almost make the update work.  A zippy high school comedy.  Of course we know how it's going to turn out - that is so not the point of a film like this. As with life, the joy is the journey.  What raises this venture a few notches above your normal acne fare is an extremely clever screenplay  There have certainly been worse.  This production, these situations and characters, are to Shakespeare what advertising is to truth.  As satirical as it is romantic, this is one teen film that is wise enough to span generations in its appeal.  How much does this movie suck? Let me count the ways.  Oh 10 Things, how I loathe thee, let me count the ways.  Debut film director Gil Junger may be a TV veteran making a movie for the Clearasil crowd, but he doesn't sacrifice the story to gimmicky camerawork or overzealous pacing.  Since the natural audience for this is girls under 18, do they really need the message that brains are a bad thing, dooming them to a dateless high school career?  Ni su trama ni sus personajes son de aquellos con los que se pueda identificar la mayoria  The pleasingly acerbic Stiles gives it her all, and if the script had had one-tenth the zest of the now-classic "AtomicShakespeare" episode of the TV series "Moonlighting" she might have managed to make something of the vehicle.  A routine exercise in teen-targeted silliness.  Most of the picture is flat, spiritless and hopelessly staged.  It's a witty, engaging confection underpinned by an air of sophistication which manages to lend its characters considerable depth and credibility.  I didn't exactly hate this film.  By all rights it should have been as incredibly heinous as other recent juvenile jaunts, but it's actually kinda cute on occasion.  It's a fast-food film, easy to digest, but nothing remarkable or memorable.  No one in this film is a big star, but everyone is a capable actor.  Stiles, whose slightly rushed, impatient delivery sometimes recalls the young Jane Fonda, lets enough sweetness seep into her portrayal to lend even the nastiest retort a hint of forgiveness.  It's so knowingly cute that most of its jokes go nowhere.  Despite a tinny script, the cast puts in fine performances in what is a very unfunny movie. But the praise stops there.  When it's being its goofy funny self, it scores.  creenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith retain Shakespeare's morals and complicated conventions, while director Gil Junger keeps the pace fast, dodging cliches as often as he can.  Lame scenes are made nifty by the movie's endless energy.  Overall, it plays well because of its non-stop pace, the interesting relationship between the sisters, and most of all, the enjoyable and engaging performances by stars-to-be Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles.  Unfortunately, much of this potentially good material is paced like a bad sitcom.  Definitely a cut above the current crop of teen-oriented comedies, thanks to an appealing cast of fresh faces, as well as a surprisingly literate script.  Miller is outstanding as a father who is utterly convinced that dating is the first step towards instant and complete moral and sexual decay.  What would Shakespeare have made of all of this? I suspect he would have approved.  Easily transcends its hackneyed plot through vivacious acting, crackling dialogue, and sympathetic characters.  It includes some genuinely funny moments, solid performances from its too-old-to-be-in-high-school cast, and respect for its likely pre-teen audience.  Stiles Styles .  I doubt I would be able to find ten things I hate about 10 Things I Hate About You, but the positive aspects of the film far out-number ten.  The high school romance genre has become so popular that it's running out of new ideas and has taken to recycling classic literature.  The performances by Stiles and Ledger stand out.  </td>

      <th>1408</th>
      <td> Like shacking up with a cheap hooker in a moderately priced hotel, 1408 delivers dirty thrills with few frills.  Another actor may have made 1408 seem as thin and fake as an episode of Tales from the Crypt, but Cusack lends it that badly needed extra milligram of conviction.  1408 is another Stephen King adaptation where the main protagonist is a writer. It is also a fine psychological horror movie and welcome change of pace from the ultra violent, gore polluted, torture porn flicks currently infecting cinema.  The success of 1408 rests squarely on [John Cusack's] Hawaiian shirt-clad shoulders, and he pulls it off. The role, that is. The tacky shirt stays on pretty well the whole time.  A good, old-fashioned horror flick, one that relies on supernatural chills, psychological twists and top-shelf special effects -- as opposed to the recent trend toward ball gags, bound wrists and bad lighting.  Cusack's gritty, near over-the-top performance goes a long way, as does the subtle slow burn from director Mikael Hafstrom, but Samuel L. Jackson needed to be nudged awake as the hotel manager.  Forcing the audience to experience his terror with an almost first-hand immediacy, Cusack runs the emotional gamut ...  Una buena idea y unos 20 minutos iniciales inquietantes y sugestivos se descarrilan rapidamente hacia la parafernalia y el exceso visual. Nada convence, excepto el esfuerzo de John Cusack por convencernos de que se lo ha tomado en serio.  From the start, it builds to a point of unbearable tension and then rewards us with a payoff that is cleverly executed and genuinely terrifying.  Cusack always manages to underscore panic with irony.  I'm very hard to please when it comes to the horror genre, but pleased I am with 1408, a dread concoction from Stephen King, sharply committed to film by a clever screenplay, solid direction and terrific performances.  The legitimately creepy exposition turns into relentlessly typical "haunted house" boilerplate.  Though not especially original, this is frightening and disturbing film and the effects take a while to wear off.  For all of 1408's shortcomings, all that's really needed to lift it a level is some decent scares, but one or two spooky moments just isn't enough.  ...one of the most gleefully loony things you'll see this year.  You leave the film once again feeling that Stephen King is either not quite as good as his reputation or that most film-makers can't replicate the subtleties of his style.  1408 is the best King conversion since Misery.  "No one lasts more than an hour," goes the saying about the room. It's probably how long your attention lasts too. But it's one hell of an hour.  John Cusack's edgy, likeable performance carries this paranormal chiller, based on a Stephen King story and highly reminiscent of his landmark shockfest The Shining.  Cusack, who is in almost every scene, is astutely cast: his sardonic persona gradually disintegrates as the room plays its malevolent tricks on him.  It all rather sidesteps the question of why reluctant manager Samuel L.&amp;#8201;Jackson fails to demand a written disclaimer from a guest insisting on a room that has seen 56 deaths, including drowning in chicken soup.  Unpretentious and effective.  Check in if you are a fan of Cusack or King.  Even if by the closing act the movie has begun to feel a bit preposterous (enter the giant sea storm) and the resolution a bit saccharine, that's a small price to pay for a movie that's trying hard to reinvent horror the old-fashioned way.  All good fun, but if horror films are meant to make you leap from your seat, this is an abject failure.  Despite faltering with an overblown second half, and stealing no thunder from Kubrick's haunted hotel effort, 1408 remains one of the more accomplished King adaptations. A deliciously old-school surprise.  A terrific performance from John Cusack as a cynic on a paranormal mission nudges this towards the higher end of King adaps. Eventually lets itself down, but not before shaking you up.  Not up there with the best King adaptations, but a fun Gothic yarn that, like all good ghost stories, is simple and dripping with dread.  Enjoyable chiller with some terrific suspense scenes and a superb performance from John Cusack.  Things certainly go bump in the night in this slow-burning Stephen King adaptation. But 1408's short story origins are very clear: think a long, if enjoyable, episode of The Twilight Zone.  in terms of quality, 1408 is neither executive suite nor basement broom cupboard.  This presses all the right buttons, and is perfect accompaniment to the theater's air conditioning. A definite must for fans.  A horror movie that eschews today's penchant for torture porn and gets back to the basics.  For its first half, 1408 is genuinely scary ... [but] about halfway in when the setting moves from a believable universe to a wholly unrecognizable one and our ability to connect emotionally with what we're seeing is weakened.  Although 1408 lacks the dramatic power of either Misery or The Shining, John Cusack's riveting performance rivals that of James Caan and Jack Nicholson.  A minor idea squandered by ham-fisted details.  On the creep-o-meter, I'll give it a five out of 10.  A story that supports it's interesting theme of eventuality: even the strongest doubter may one day come around to believe in King's world of warped reality.  a cannily effective horrorshow, even if its PG-13 scares sometimes feel like they've been pulled a bit  More thriller than horror flick, this could even be viewed as a really dark comedy.  The film is like an effective haunted house with one eerie set piece following another.  Props to Enslin's tape recorder for rivaling Wilson the Cast Away volleyball as Best Inanimate Object For A Man On The Verge Of A Nervous Breakdown.  A savvy slab of undecorated cheese, made compelling by its unflinching willingness to dive into the material headfirst.  On balance, 1408 runs the numbers better than most.  One of the most spooky films i've seen in a long time...  Hoping to set itself apart from the current horror trend, 1408 is spooky but never scary and for some viewers that will be more than enough.  The limited setting is effectively claustrophobic, although it adds a sense that the story isn't going anywhere.  It's only when the proceedings turn to maudlin "psychological horror" that the film turns tiresome.  My only complaint with the film is that it takes a bit too long to find its ending.  It's offers a refreshing spin on the horror formula, and joins The Shining, Vacancy and Barton Fink as a film that makes the usually accommodating hotel business seem disturbingly bad for your mental health.  Cusack, an excellent actor, gives one of his best performances in this film.  Pretty much a standard Stephen King adaptation that wasn't made by Brian DePalma, Stanley Kubrick or David Cronenberg.  Just what does Stephen King have against the hotel industry?  Blair Witch in a hotel room, and way scarier than a bundle of sticks and a pile of rocks. It makes The Shining look like a cheap motel.  1408 is the first genuinely scary movie I've seen since The Ring, and it restores my faith in Hollywood's ability to make artful horror.  Definitely one of the best King adaptations in years ... and I've seen 'em all.  It's when the momentum remains inescapable that it's really on.  An intellectual, character-driven horror film, one that gets under your skin not through your stomach, but through your nightmares.  Devolves into a cavalcade of gee-whiz special effects, psychological sturm und drang and false endings.  a decidedly old-school film, relying on tension and gothic scares rather than buckets of blood.  When Mike Enslin (John Cusack) says he does not believe in ghosts, we in the audience cannot be blamed for not wishing him well, but he does turn in a stellar performance in what largely a stagey, one-man show.  Mike and Lily argue, he feels guilty, and now he's got to relive the whole thing -- not as memory but as reality-TV video, which does seem unduly harsh.  You'll want to check out room "1408."That is, if you like a solid horror story, fine performances and Stephen King tales.  1408 isn't great cinema, but does an adequate job in spite of its flaws.  While not actually scary, 1408 is unsettling and intense, taking its own sweet time building to a truly disconcerting climax.  Evokes the author's good points as well as his bad, but like its fast-talking hero, it was in trouble the minute the door closed behind it.  Seriously, forget all the movie theme park rides you've ever heard of; there needs to be a 1408 ride at Universal Studios.  ..while things may go a bit overboard in 1408, the story has a unique and unexpected way of doubling back on itself that more than compensates.  the majority of the movie is built entirely around Enslin's scary safari into his subconscious, and Cusack gives a high-powered performance that never fails to hold your attention.  Takes what was a basically straightforward (albeit kickass) work of fantasy-tinged horror and turns it into something completely different: an abstract, surreal portrait of a man dealing with his grief.  It reminds us what it's like to be scared in a theater rather than overwhelmed by buckets of blood and gore.  It is relentless and unsettling, and as a bonus, it turns a Carpenters wedding staple into a murder ballad. That, my friends, takes skill.  The tale is skimpy, mostly set in a New York City suite that, despite its bustling midtown location, is said to host unspeakable evil-and it doesn't even have Wi-Fi.  Finally, a good old fashioned scary movie. And hey, it's PG-13 so why not bring the kids along for a little psychological scarring?  Cusack, a talented everyman but not quite a slick leading-man type, spends much of his time alone, battling the elements as it were.  While 1408 is no classic, it is refreshing to see a horror picture that just wants to do its job rather than prove to its audience how ruthlessly nihilistic it is.  The movie attempts a false ending that doesn't quite work; the picture feels prolonged, dragged out, and its ennui lessens the impact of some of its more terrifying fillips.  A faithful and creepy adaptation of [King's] 2002 short story.  It's an overblown campfire tale that doesn't know when to stop.  Even as haunted hotel King movies go, 1408 is certainly no Shining. Not even the TV-movie version.  A genuinely disturbing and ingenious piece of horror that's as much a brainteaser as it is a feast of visual creativity.  1408 is one of the good Stephen King adaptations, one that maintains its author's sly sense of humor and satiric view of human nature.  Handsomely shot and well-acted but only modestly involving for much of its length, 1408 doesn't perk up until its final half-hour. By then it's too late.  Scary, smart, and moving, it's a terrific summer entertainment for grown-ups.  An entertainingly hairy paranormal affair based on a King short story, 1408 sets up its star -- and its audience -- for a blood-curdling, bone-chilling night of horror.  Director Mikael Hafstrom creates effective atmospherics, and for a good long while 1408 manages to avoid the crutch of F/X.  There's ghoulish fun and Hichcockian suspense until the film hits a narrative wall around the 60-minute mark.  If I ever check into a hotel room and the clock radio is playing the Carpenters, I'm going to freak out.  In this mix of recycled scares and half-hearted twists, the only real fright is the sight of an interesting actor wasting his talents in yet another mediocre movie.  Neither viscerally compelling nor emotionally satisfying.  With a minimal amount of blood and virtually no gore, 1408 still manages to give you a major case of the creep-outs.  The dread is palpable in this chilling suspense thriller about a hotel room that more than lives up to its evil reputation.  For a deep-in-the-bones sense of dread that great horror generates, 1408 comes up short.  Only made me scream in agony on how hokey it was.  1408 ranks as the summer's smartest, spookiest surprise.  You might say 1408 has a 1409 ending -- beige, humdrum, only mildly uncomfortable and, once passed through on the journey home, instantly forgettable.  While it springs from a fairly pat premise, the execution is superb, eschewing cheap scares for throbbing, intense shocks.  You would assume that Stephen King had wrung about all the neurosis that could be squeezed from the haunted-writer theme in Secret Window, Misery and, most famously, The Shining. You would, however, be wrong -- dead wrong.  ...an old-fashioned ghost story that understands people are more frequently haunted than places.  A psychologically thrilling movie that leaves you gasping in the end.  Cusack is uniquely suited to the role; a movie that really wanted to spook us would posit him as a happy, church-going family man. But until such time, we have Swedish director Mikael Hafstrom's fun take on Stephen King's short story of the same name.  All the suspense and shock depends on [Cusack's] performance, how he reacts from minute to minute, and he does a terrific job under Mikael Hafstrom's direction.  1408 would have been much worse had it starred Jim Carrey, and The Number 23 would have been much better had it starred John Cusack.  The problem with this movie is that it feels too much like a joke rather than a true work of suspense.  When it comes to Hollywood's treatment of his works, Stephen King hasn't always hit the jackpot. But with this smart and highly entertaining ghost story his luck may change.  An underwhelming psychological thriller and ghost story.  If not for a hokey ending and some cheesy plot devices, "1408" would have been the scariest, and best, ghost movie of the season.  No matter how entertaining the gorefests of folks like Eli Roth are, there will always be an entertainment value in films that are more into spooking people than making them sick.  ...few scares, fewer surprises...  The ability of 1408 to raise goosebumps relies on Cusack's skill in making even the doubting Enslin appear genuinely terrified.  Stripped of unnecessary gore and predictable scare tactics, 1408 is a chilling psychological mind-bender, which stays true to its Stephen King roots.  Domestic difficulties were central to the scariness of 'The Shining' and 'Pet Sematary,' but here the psychological back story and so-called character development seem like padding.  Virtually a one-man show by Cusack, and he's up to the task.  ...ultimately little doubt that the film's build-up is more effective than its pay-off.  A Stephen King short story is adapted and brought to the screen in 1408, more psychological thriller than outright horror.  While it's refreshing to see a scary movie that's not about torture and dismembered corpses, that's not enough.  Cusack carries it all, especially when there aren't any other actors around for him to interact with.  Hafstrom turns in a clean, almost old-fashioned film with a precise rhythm... But the movie's real trick is the rising sense of dreadful expectation.  While 1408 is no Shining, it's a solid and welcome entry to the kind of begotten supernatural tales all too sparse in contemporary cinema.  A much better-than-average horror flick that doesn't rely on hardcore torture and gore to thrill it's audience.  one of the best horror movies I have seen in a few years  1408 stumbles one too many times and cannot escape the genre's most common curse -- the dumb ending.  A little suspension of disbelief goes a long way once the scary stuff gets going.  gruesome and psychologically chilling, not gory and shockingly gross  Stephen King can be counted on to put the fun back into a ghost story. He did it with The Shining, and again in 1408, a short story that is the basis for this suspenseful chiller about a writer's hallucinogenic night in a haunted room.  Hafstrom can't balance the requirement of excitement with the necessity of depth without jerking the film's pace around like a bad carnival ride.  If you like 'spooky' but not 'gross' -- if you like to be scared without being assaulted -- then 1408 should do the trick.  1408 amounts to little more than a radical shock-therapy session for a man still finding his way after the loss of his daughter. Best to leave him alone with his issues.  Swedish director Mikael Hafsrom, who scored with Evil in 2003 and fizzled badly with Derailed two years later, seems to have regained his footing.  Your check-in time for the Dolphin Hotel's room 1408 should be whenever the movie hits video stores.  The story features some surprises, and director Mikael Hafstrom adds realism by bypassing computer graphics for practical effects. Add in the natural fear of being trapped in tight spaces and you have a can't-miss formula for horror and suspense.  1408 is not quite interesting enough to linger long in the mind, but it has enough jack-in-the-box chills to mollify those who feel it's been all downhill since The Uninvited.  John Cusack is virtually a one-man show in the claustrophobically chilling 1408.  1408 offers proof that you really can make a creepy and effective, PG-13-rated horror movie.  Underneath the atmosphere and pizzazz is an intimate and thoughtful portrait of one man's return from an abyss infinitely more haunting than any old, evil hotel room.  Adapted from a Stephen King story, this trite but watchable chiller plays like a scaled-down version of The Shining, with Cusack driven over the edge by hallucinations of his abusive father and dead daughter.  It's a good, solid scare picture, modestly scaled but well-crafted. And unlike certain other horror items on offer right now, this one doesn't make you feel like a psycho-in-training for sitting through it.  As the film chips away at the psychological barriers that protect a non-believer from being scared, don't expect your defenses to fare any better.  Listen up, all you Hostels, Saws and other purveyors of bloody terror. Lay down your whips, chain saws and paring knives to watch a truly scary movie.  Stephen King's claustrophobic obsessions are well served by Hafstrom and Cusack.  Based on a Stephen King story, 1408 takes the simplest plot and turns it into an enjoyably surreal, unnerving creepfest.  1408's a room none of us would want to visit in real life but one everyone should spend some time in while in the safety of a darkened theater.  Cusack is supposed to be a haunted-house pro, but after a window shuts on his fingers and the sink sprays hot water, he turns hysterical. Shouldn't he call maintenance first?  Not only is the trailer for 1408 oodles more terrifying than the movie itself; worse, for the most part, this pop-horror trifle adapted from a Stephen King short story grows into a formulaic bore.  Never has a King size bed had such an air of imminent menace.  It pins you into a claustrophobic chamber of terror for a surprisingly stomach-turning thrill ride.  Quaint or not, this King adaptation chills, and may have you Googling the next hotel you're scheduled to check into, room by room.  Sure, this is pretty much an episode of The Twilight Zone, but it's a really, really good episode of The Twilight Zone  Yes, it's that kind of film--what kind of film did you think it was going to be?  Finds some ingenious methods of visualizing the story's literary whim-whams. Before it finally succumbs to CGI bloat in the last act, it offers up one of the creepiest hours in recent memory.  1408 ranks as one of the best [Stephen] King adaptations for the screen.  A retro joy, a Halloween Haunted House of a movie that delivers the sort of pleasurable shivers and jolts that today's exercises in torture porn don't even attempt.  Regardless of how long you last in 1408, the logic to which you are entitled never comes.  The horror wouldn't work without Cusack, who makes what could have been a rote acting exercise -- Be tough! Now angry! Now defensively funny! -- a cathartic ritual instead.  a slick psychological thriller masquerading as a good old-fashioned ghost story  1408 generally survives and thrives on the strength of John Cusack's passionate performance as a skeptic of the supernatural who learns that spooks may be real, plus a spirited supporting role by Samuel L. Jackson and some effective chills.  The best movie based on a Stephen King horror story since The Shining.  Cusack manages to summon deep wellsprings of personal grief along with breezy humor and naked animal terror. It's a tour de force performance that confirms the talents of this remarkably versatile, sometimes underrated actor.  Don't expect lots of guts and gore, but there's tension aplenty, lots of shocks, and several false ends to the torment, which make it seem even more intense.  This isn't a horror movie about... screams and yells, it's more like chills and little moments of revelation.  Unlike Jack Nicholson and James Caan, who also played troubled novelists in King-inspired films, John Cusack gives an utterly sympathetic and likable performance that puts us on his side in a flick that makes a virtue of being old-fashioned horror.  1408's mixture of supernatural hullabaloo and spiritual awakening is sturdily propped up by Cusack, whose performance is equal parts caustic cynicism and empathetic turmoil.  Haunted houses aside, never were buildings such immense sources of creepiness and fright before 9/11.  Room 1408 presents a psychological, paranormal and physical juggernaut that will curl your insides in knots.  Refuses to embrace the fashionable elements of torture porn that are currently cutting a bloody swath through the horror genre, relying largely on psychological terror to impart the sense of someone possibly going mad, and taking the viewer along.  Overall 1408 is just a light turndown in the Stephen King film scheme, but don't worry: it *will* disturb!  Reassuringly old-school gothic.  </td>

      <td> An uneven film and overlong, but not without some merit.  Not quite sure why this one tanked as badly as it did; I thought it was gorgeously realized, myself.  Over-ambitious but still utterly beautiful  Misses the mark by an entire continent.  This is one Columbus who should have stayed at home. A real loser.  Gorgeous to look at and frequently quite compelling ... but, obviously, not without some big gaping flaws.

      <th>2 Days in the Valley</th>
      <td> To the director's credit, the actors all seem responsive to his touch, giving performances that are lively and flavorsome, if not deep or unlike anything each of them has done before.  Herzfeld has a tolerable eye for filling a 'Scope frame but a tin ear when it comes to creating dialogue; these are all characters we've met before, and most even seem bored with themselves.  It's not that this is a bad, blackly comic slice-of-lowlife: It's just that you've just seen it all before.  A quirky, multi-character collage that skillfully keeps you off balance, not knowing where it's headed.  One constant is its lovely cinematography. Another is its utter insignificance.  Smoothly constructed, for such a busy piece of work, and Hatcher's ascent to stardom continues.  When the highlight of your movie is a catfight between Teri Hatcher and Charlize Theron...well, it's not necessarily a bad thing, but it couldve been better  Charlize Theron is super-sexy, and devilishy memorable  an intelligent thriller - a nice surprise  This smart movie never seemed smart.  Closer to straightforward drama than black comedy.  Among the many lacking Pulp Fiction carbon copies that refuses to realize its surrealistic shortcomings. An exaggerated and aimless mess starving for attention  A sleek, amusingly nasty screen debut by a film maker whose television credits include an Amy Fisher docudrama.  Like its protagonists, it misses the target by inches.  An ensemble-cast mishmash of crime and betrayal that manages to work.  This movie isn't bad for mere entertainment, but it's overshadowed by other, better movies in the same genre.  Funny, pathetic, sad, absurdist -- writer-director John Herzfeld plays it any number of ways, and makes them all work.  Herzfeld's marriage of dark humor with graphic violence isn't compatible, and his occasional moral statements about cheapened life stick out like sore thumbs.  A somewhat entertaining ride to nowhere in particular.  2 Days in the Valley is witty and bracing in its own right, and it shouldn't be buried under extraneous comparisons to Pulp Fiction.  There are too many characters, but some are a lot of fun. The tone shifts, from graphic murder to wig-flipping farce, are too extreme, but much of it works.  Herzfeld was obviously shooting for Pulp Fiction meets Short Cuts, but the film is more like Four Rooms meets Pret-a-Porter.  The plot underlies even the most inexplicable scenes and eventually links even the most widely separated characters, but what makes the movie fun is the dialogue and the behavior.  Somehow, although this film's unevenness tends to take us out of the action now and then, there's something kind of agreeable about it.  Herzfeld, an award-winning television writer and director, didn't craft either a compelling story or create characters with any real depth.  On the whole, there are some good moments in the movie, but altogether, 2 Days in the Valley is about one day too much.  As a joy ride, 2 days in the Valley is like a drive down Sunset Boulevard in a convertible Cadillac -- so very Valley, it's shallow but fun.  A genuinely human redemption story wrapped in a dark, violent thriller.  This produces some rather nasty-funny surprises.  A solid picture that is probably accessible to a wider audience than Pulp Fiction was...  Herzfeld's characters border on the bizarre, and yet each is endearing.  Not everyone will get this film, but for those who appreciate the delectable rewards of black comedy, this is an encounter with substantial rewards.  A tense, heartfelt, funny and sometimes brutal film.  Shallow characterisation, a script so laid-back you can almost hear it snoring and the occasional outburst of hokey dialogue lead to a movie a good deal less charming than it thinks it is.  A jumbled hodgepodge with an excess of plot masquerading as hip thriller.  It's pure entertainment -- nothing too serious, nothing too deep -- with an artistic sensibility.  </td>

      <th>2 Fast 2 Furious</th>
      <td> It's a pretty bold move to make a film for groups of young males about the latent sexual nature of the relationships in such groups - and this alone made 2 Fast, 2 Furious an unexpectedly hilarious treat.  Death by sequel. Extremely violent sequel.  The philosophy here is when you can't make high art, make high trash.  ...ultimately doesn't fare as well as its mediocre predecessor...  I'd go so far as to say that if you really liked this film, you have a career working in fast food to look forward to. Get it? Fast food?  ... it provides enough sexy rides, blacktop fury, screeching hairpin turns and crashes to keep the celluloid humming ...  This is not a movie about people. It's about cars going very, very fast.  It's all curiously rote, though: The cars go really fast, and then, for a change, they go really, really fast.  Just because you give an old car a new paint job doesn't mean it runs better.  Whatever charms the first one had, the sequel badly misses the Diesel-injection.  Surprisingly better minus the original director and star, this sequel to the 2001 sleeper hit should have no problem speeding its way to box office gold  The film relies on kinetic energy as its entertainment hook. There is plenty of action, no doubt, but hardly any of it inventive.  The movie is not going to bring many new fans to the following, but hey -- it gots colour, speed and sparks.  2 Fast 2 Furious takes it for granted that the audience is comprised of morons. And maybe we are-all those bad video games have gone to our head  2 Fast 2 Furious does a better job of revving up its B-movie engines than its predecessor.  It's not that Paul Walker doesn't have the looks and the conviction; it's just that what he has isn't enough to boost this picture out of the pits and engage the emotional gears. All in all, 2 little 2 make noise about.  Its engines-without-attitude approach isn't just boring, it establishes Singleton as the anti-Walter Hill.  2 Fast 2 Furious not 2 bad  If you feel the need for speed in John Singleton's sluggish sequel to The Fast and the Furious then remember: just say no.  If the souped up, day-glo cars could have driven themselves, the movie could easily have done without the actors.  Em vez de + Velozes + Furiosos, este longa deveria se chamar Turbinas &amp; Silicones 2.  Singleton's movie is as ingenious as a cop in a car chase movie.  Not a good movie or a consistently solid action flick, but it is a big step up. I guess that's not much of a compliment considering what it is an improvement over, but take it for what it's worth.  ... The quintessence of the mainstream summer sequel: loud, slick, preposterous and thoroughly disposable, where any potentially damaging sugar of invention is quickly, safely flushed out of its engine so the machinery of manipulation and the Law of Dimin  The vehicular action in 2 Fast is profoundly low-tech, and engagingly brawny.  2 Fast 2 Furious -- 2 hours of my life I won't get back.  This flick had "2" many problems to be good. It should've been called "2 Slow 2 Calm."  A genuine guilty pleasure.  Director John Singleton once promised greatness with Boyz N the Hood. Here he's going through the paces with a story that was old by the second season of Miami Vice.  Walker and Tyrese go for a no-frills style, giving the antiheroic protagonists solid emotional underpinnings before all the fancy driving gets started.  A feature-length demolition derby custom-made for members of MADD - Moviegoers with Attention Deficit Disorder.  Entertaining, though, those cars are 2 neon and 2 1980s.  I have two pet hates when it comes to sequels; most aren't necessary, and most stars don't return from the original. Welcome to 2 Fast 2 Furious.  It's 2 silly 2 take seriously but 2 fun 2 be bad.  Like Smokey and the Bandit for a younger, more fly, urban generation.  About as anachronistic and generic as an action sequel could be.  It's all very nice to look at, sure, but pretty colors and molten intercoolers aside, 2 Fast 2 Furious is about as exciting as a Yugo in quicksand.  Worth seeing only if you've seen all the better movies now in release.  A summer movie that offers sporadic thrills and spills with nothing but dead air surrounding them.  Still, 2F2F's rambunctious road rage schtick is one hot-rod high-wire act that is in need of some serious dramatic alignment. This is one plucky yet pointless speed demon dud that's definitely 2 B 4-gotten.  It's about as lightweight as a cars-and-crime action movie should be.  It makes you wonder if this trip was really necessary.  Singleton's "Baby Boy" discovery, Tyrese, steps on the gas and leaves former star Diesel in the dust.  Where's Roger Corman when you need him?  A disappointing step downward ... betraying what simple vision the original film had.  It's a terrible movie, stuck in plot idiocies and big, noisy set pieces like a tire mired in mud.  (2 Fast 2 Furious is) big, fast, loud cars and scantily-clad beautiful women. It's every adolescent's fantasy pasted onto the screen.  Never title a movie the same way a junior high girl signs her yearbook.  A fun enough ambiguously gay carsploitation flick even though it's instantly forgettable.  This John Singleton-directed sequel provides a breezy enough joyride,but it lacks the unassuming freshness of the economy-priced original.  Just another retread.  2 shallow 4 words.  How could we possibly reconnect with the primal urges of speed-demon street racers, without Vin's din? The answer, in two words: Vroom. Vroom.  The movie delivers on its title's promise some of the time, but there's too much dead air, so it amounts to 90 minutes of squealing tires, occasionally interrupted by yammering that might better be titled 2 Dopey 2 Believe.  Superficial? You betcha. But eye candy, attitude and humor abound in what amounts to a glorified Miami Vice episode complete with an undercover lawman who lives aboard a boat.  For all its technical prowess, pretty-boy looks and fetishistic appeal, 2 Fast is often laid low by a leaden script and a couple of glaring casting blunders.  2 Much, 2 Loud, 2 Dumb  Nothing says summer film fun like explosions, guns and cartwheeling cars -- and that's all here.  The speed party 2 Fast 2 Furious is 2 silly 2 believe and 2 cliched 2 be very entertaining. 2 bad.  It's fun. That's all.  2 Fast 2 Furious ultimately is 2 silly, at least for a viewer without the car gene.  The pic is closer to the PlayStation experience of Gran Turismo than to a movie. This is not to say that it isn't fun, only to say that it is more about sensation than sense.  It's not science fiction but it argues, probably more persuasively than The Matrix Reloaded or Terminator 3, that we've already seen the rise of the machines.  It's not every movie that would announce its shortcomings right in its title.  We expect Pamela Anderson and her VIP crew to come traipsing out in their high heels and cheap props. It's a shame they don't -- the film would be significantly improved.  Without Diesel, there's not much gas, at least not from the nonvehicular elements.  A film for people who like really loud car sounds, who get breathless when tires squeal and clutches pop, who dream of a special button near the steering wheel that takes your lemon- yellow Skyline from super fast to super super fast.  Still as high-octane the second time around, even if it's firing on a few different cylinders.  Too much of 2 Fast 2 Furious plays like a colorful but inert timekiller that you might tolerate while dozing off in front of the TV, but only because you are too sleepy to reach for the remote control.  Singleton has a great visual sense, but he seems to be overthinking the action, and the result is an almost studious approach that tames the wildness of his stunts.  A contender for the worst movie of 2003.  What's not to like about a movie where the actors are as model-perfect as the cars?  Essentially a series of street races.  Even if you resist recklessness, these car catharses surge with noise, energy and adrenaline.  The movie 2 Fast 2 Furious is not 2 good, but as a mental junk-food diversion, it's an occasionally stimulating jolt.  A mediocre film that could have been much worse.  This sequel to the brain-dead 2001 hot-rodding hit is even more brain-dead.  A chaotic blur of a movie with only one discernible objective: to rev the idling engines of a mostly youthful audience.  Even more of a joy ride than the original.  Has its fair share of adrenaline, but the plot is shot through with more holes than Christina Aguilera's favorite awards outfit.  It's pure formula from start to finish, but that was obviously the goal from start to finish.  It doesn't have a brain in its head, but it's made with skill and style and, boy, is it fast and furious.  . . . pretty enjoyable if you look at it as the B-movie it really ought to be, rather than the E-ticket major studio release it actually is.  The trouble with movies like this one, of course, is that you can't race or crash cars for 100 minutes in a row.  Director John Singleton seems to have finally found his niche: meaningless movies full of girls in tiny outfits and boys in tiny cars.  This is better -- though less culturally interesting -- than the movie that inspired it.  Paul Walker is probably the worst performer on the planet, but 2 Fast 2 Furious turns out to be mildly amusing entertainment.  Energetic if empty sequel.  Very, very cool and very, very dumb.  It's ridiculous and knows it. It's the Dukes of Hazzard for the rave/glowstick generation.  A crude, sloppy, four-wheeled extravaganza; the best thing about this sequel is that it's not quite as bad as its ridiculous title indicates.  It's far too lazy to explore any new levels of stupidity. It's happy to simply loll around on the surface, recapturing already charted levels of stupidity.  You would think the producers would have hired a director who could put together an exciting action sequence and not the guy who made a hash of Shaft.  For those who were less than impressed with The Fast and the Furious, the sequel offers up some kinetics much more in keeping with the franchise title.  Maybe it's the gas fumes talking, but 2 Fast 2 Furious is a real joy ride.  The movie delivers what it should -- cheap thrills -- and serves them up with skill and economy.  The ride looks tricked out, but it sure is clunky under the hood.  2 Fast 2 Furious is just 2 lame, 2 tame, and 2 much like a video game.  For the DVD special edition, they might consider removing everything but the races and chases, including its Smokey and the Bandit scramble; fast-forwarding may be just too much effort.  About as anachronistic and generic as an action sequel could be.  Plays like an unusually bad, overblown episode of Miami Vice, and has virtually none of the pleasures of the original.  A lark for anyone who's willing to check their brains at the concession stand for 100 minutes.  A kind of Miami Vice with many more carz and numberz where all the adjectives used 2 go.  2 Fast 2 Furious is that rare film that's perfectly described by one of its co-stars' names: Ludacris.  ...doomed to the dreaded obscurity of films so bad, they don't even get made fun of on Saturday Night Live.  2 Fast 2 Furious... 2 flawed  It's as much of a guilty pleasure as the loud, adrenaline-fueled original -- maybe more so because it yields even lower expectations.  Charged with exhilarating car-racing sequences, this movie nails the car culture scene and packages it into an entertaining summer movie.  ["2 Fast 2 Furious"] has an energy of its own that allows it to stand on its own two feet. Or, is that "on its own four tires"?  After the adrenaline rush wears off from the high-energy street racing of the opening sequence, they abandon the cars and switch to a plot (what were they thinking).  2 Fast doesn't have the goods under the hood.  "2 Fast 2 Furious" is such an improvement over its predecessor that it's easy to overlook the fact that it's not actually a good movie.  Cars-and-consumerism action flick has John Singleton behind the wheel but no Diesel in the tank, making for a lackluster blockbuster sequel.  As I sat and had the rampant awfulness of 2 Fast 2 Furious wash over me, I could actually FEEL the contempt and indifference of the filmmakers. 2 Awful 4 Words.  When you long for the fantasy of what Hal Needham could have brought to the material, you get the picture.  What Paul Walker needed was a stunt double. To stand in for him the entire movie.  Can a film be both 2 fast and 2 furious 2 B enjoyable? This age old question is answered with several affirmative engine roars.  2 Fast 2 Furious is among the most lethargic action movies I have ever seen: when Mr. Walker and Tyrese are not driving, it might as well be called 2 Slow 2 Tedious.  2 Fast 2 Furious is frequently 2 fast 4 its own good, and only about 1/2 as furious as the last one. You do the math.  It's unapologetic hackwork aimed at guys who never forgave Mom for throwing out their Hot Wheels set.  Instead of the multi-everything family that races, parties and thieves together, Singleton unleashes spasms of sadism and innumerable leering shots of girls gone wild, albeit -- alas -- not behind the wheel.  Splashy, shallow entertainment that delivers most of what its audience expects.  The film has enough wild driving to satisfy any French Connection fan or Bullitt buff, but there's precious little for anyone else to enjoy.  Many too many close-ups of feet slamming down on pedals, hands shifting gears, and eyes narrowing meaningfully in the rear-view mirror. I am the one who is furious at having to sit through this dumb movie.  nothing more than a drive-in movie with a bigger than usual budget ... the plot is custom-made for long breaks at the concession counter, and the dialogue is anything but unleaded.  For PG-13 popcorn-munching, it ain't half-bad.  2Fast 2Furious has everything you want -- especially if what you want is 2Fast 2Furious.  This shaggy-dog sequel is ultimately satisfying for the most low-tech of reasons: The competitive bond between the two central characters.  Unless you're a car nut or big fan of camp, steer clear.  The Fast and the Furious was no classic, but it got you where it was going. 2 Fast 2 Furious shows some speed as well, but it's traveling down the road already taken.  The cars are a rockin' and even the friggin' movie screen felt like it was shaking as the cars flew by.  '2 Fast' '2 Furious' = "4 Pity's Sake, Spare Us No. 3,' Isn't much beyond the level of a repeat episode of 'Fastlane.'  A satisfying adrenaline rush, it is a mindless bit of escapism that speaks to the inner teenage rebel in us all.  I'd have gone with 2 Loud 2 Obnoxious, or 2 Ridiculous 2 Unnecessary.  Strong off the starting line, it stalls before reaching the second reel due to a distinct lack of "Diesel" power.  If Singleton had stuck with the aura of his opening scene and let 2 Fast play out like low-budget trash from the 1970s, "2 Fast" might have earned some guilty pleasure points.  Like its predecessor, 2 Fast 2 Furious has a good-natured and realistic sense of its own junky weightlessness.  It feels like an old-fashioned Smokey &amp; The Bandit romp with all the high-tech thrills of a CG world.  This unabashedly meaningless affair wholeheartedly subscribes to the more-is-better recipe for cinematic second installments.  An example of what can happen when the lowest common denominator meets a director in sulky decline.  Sometimes you'll laugh with the film, sometimes at it, and sometimes you'll be fumbling for the seatbelt.  ...all too obvious and predictable..  </td>

      <th>21</th>
      <td> Craps out leaving you wondering how it all went so wrong.  Too bland, too bright and too long, 21 may talk a big game but it is mainly insipid entertainment.  Luketic's dunderheaded, would-be caper is a morality tale where the only moral at stake is the dullard-hero's thoughtless entitlement  It's a slick enough movie, with an intriguing enough concept. It would be a much more enjoyable movie, however, if the wheels didn't come off script-wise.  One can't help but think there was a smarter film to be made from this premise.  When the movie 21 was announced with Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne, it sounded like a winner. When everybody else involved in 21 was mentioned, it was doomed to be a loser.  If only director Robert Luketic and screenwriters Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb had not opted for glitz. As filmmakers, they're playing for very low stakes.  As ever with gambling films, it's difficult to convey the thrill of winning at second hand; the human-interest complications are unconvincing and Spacey himself, I'm afraid, is a lugubrious and deadening presence.  Spacey makes a nicely chilly villain and Bosworth a warm and glamorous leading lady, if an implausible maths genius.  Disappointing thriller that's let down by a tedious script, a frankly ridiculous final act and some dodgy overacting by Kevin Spacey.  This is a prime example of a movie that isn't bad, per se, just unnecessary, a competently made but wholly unremarkable trifle.  See this for the sheer fascination of it.  Regardless whether there are a number of cliches and plot incongruities, this entertaining and fast-paced flick will find an audience hoping to learn how to beat the dealer.  Even though you can predict what happens, 21 is still fairly compelling for a movie about counting cards at a blackjack table.  It has some decent eye candy, but overall this film is bluffing if they think it's a great, intelligent blackjack film. I know I just used a poker term, but I doubt 21 would have noticed.  Everyone involved should have known when to fold 'em. The movie is about as interesting as counting cards.  Empty calories, yes, but tasty enough.  Treating card playing as an exciting spectator sport rather than, say, about as thrilling as watching fishing for two hours, this offbeat cautionary tale warns all those impulsive casino-bound eggheads out there, that losers come in all IQ's.  Much like in Vegas, whatever happened in the book and made it so marvelous stayed in the book.  It may take a rocket scientist to successfully count cards, but not to wite a smarter script than what 21 delivers.  After all the dramatizing to protect the innocent is done, the story has a nice, comfy Hollywood ending (complete with baked goods), but it's fun to ride the myth for a while, especially with such comely partners.  The film goes through the motions of a thriller, but few thrills result.  It didn't blow me away, but it was an entertaining way to spend 2 hours.  21 will deliver what the average Joe is looking for in spades. But just be ready for a schizophrenic cinematic experience that may leave you feeling like you just saw three separate movies.  The movie introduces a world and sells it extremely well. It does a good job of explaining the rules of the card-counting scam, and the actual blackjack scenes are quite exciting  A breezy, fast-moving romp that trades well on its appeal as a glitzy caper movie about high-end scam artists without losing sight of its simmering greed-is-not-so-good theme.  While this is eager-to-please Hollywood-by-numbers fare, 21 should provoke enough interest to make you pick up a copy of the book that the film cheats to get the real deal.  A cliche-ridden ride through the world of blackjack.  ... the film is such a love letter to 'Risky Business,' it almost qualifies as a pseudo remake.  The vast majority of 21 is pure fun; I would've loved to give it an unqualified rave, so its flaws are especially annoying.  Unfortunately, "21" doesn't give away any of the secrets of counting cards that the average person could use to get revenge against the casinos.  It is the gilded embodiment of the American Dream.  For a film about gambling, you don't actually see enough of it to satisfy.  21 is a fast-paced tale that makes winning look not only easy, but a lot of fun.  (The book) raises a number of interesting arguments, most of which (the movie) ignores.  The only element in 21 that saves the film from being a dreary coming-of-age story grafted onto a two-hour commercial for the Las Vegas Visitors and Convention Bureau is Spacey.  This movie's script sticks so closely to formula that it could be a film school project.  O implaus?l terceiro ato praticamente arru? o que o filme vinha mostrando de interessante at?nt?  Too bad most of the performers can't seem to pull off the insane IQs they clearly do not have.  For a movie about high-stakes gambling, 21 settles for penny-ante dramatics.  Despite primal instincts and fast-moving montages, 21 is a tired, music video-style fable.  Given the true story that inspired it, 21 really should have been a sure-fire bet. As it is, it's a split hand that only pays off thanks to Fishburne and Spacey. Still beats Lucky You, though.  Sturgess quietly sparkles as the born loser who struggles to adapt to life on winners' row.  There is a message about life, money and happiness in here somewhere but it's undone by a contrived ending.  The whizzo-conceit and slick visual bling do give it an undeniably diverting buzz, yet the movie's cautionary formula shows its hand way before the clunky final reel.  The Ocean's Eleven: The College Years mood makes for a breezy good time, even if there is, like Vegas, precious little substance beneath the glitz.  This is a really stupid movie about such smart people... When they make references to Ferris Bueller and Swingers, it just feels desperate.  In real life gambling is exciting; on movie screens it generally is not.  For most of its length, 21 seems like a cautionary tale ... at least, until the whole point is negated by a tacked-on happy ending.  Fun and nothing else, but enough so that it's worth the while.  A film that makes Rounders seem like a work of great seriousness and import.  A lot of attractive people standing in for real-life nerds, and a plot that knows all the cliches and isn't afraid to use them.  It's a gamble whether or not "21" will provide enough excitement to make you shout, "Winner, winner, chicken dinner."  Across the Universe star Jim Sturgess reaffirms himself as a sympathetic, highly likable screen presence.  ... it seems they used Film Adaptations for Dummies and thus missed an opportunity to make a great movie with style and atmosphere.  A light-weight teen romantic comedy [dressed up as a gambling movie and] filled with nothing but one-dimensional characters.  Like the Strip itself, it's all lights and music throbbing so hard you confuse yourself into thinking you're having fun.  The students are so blandly written this never builds any suspense, though it probably has some value as an empowerment fantasy for debt-ridden collegians.  Although it's definitely a fictionalization of a true story, they get the essence of this insanely crazy double life that these kids led as they were breaking the bank in Vegas.  The glossiness of director Robert Luketic's staging offers reassurance even when events turn grim, as if Luketic was unable to shake the good-time vibe of his previous films...  Some folks are calling 21 racist because Sturgess was cast as Ben Campbell, the main character, instead of someone - anyone - Asian. This is a fair battle to pick, but ...  Harold &amp; Kumar Go to Las Vegas would be lots more fun as well as more sociologically astute.  What starts out as a cerebral exercise surrenders to glitzy, formulaic poppycock, with a climatic chase scene that's about as exciting as watching me in a foot race with Carl Lewis.  starts out strong, with an attractive cast and an intriguing premise, but ultimately looses its way due to silly subplots and a muddled ending.  21 comes down to sense and not cents. Ben gets greedy, overlooks his principles and forgets his goal. But then again, he does dazzle!  Another average film that could have had so much more to offer if the screenplay followed more closely to the actual events.  Here's the deal: this is sheer escapist entertainment - and, as such, it's a good gamble.  The Hollywoodization of a true story changes what could have been gripping drama into derivative mundanity with too many plot holes to count.  While this isn't my idea of a movie that's really based on a true story, "21" still deals out an entertaining thriller.  I probably should have given it a lower grade, but I really, really like watching Laurence Fishburne hurt people.  One of those movies where the audience is always about 20 minutes ahead of the characters, chock-full of dopey inventions from a Screenwriting 101 manual.  A slick, soulless nightmare of a film with the moral center of a porno flick and a central character so shallow, loathsome and uninteresting that you keep hoping that the guys from "Funny Games" will show up and give him exactly what he deserves.  A disappointment for moviegoers who prefer their escapist entertainment to be less, well, utterly inert.  21 is not the deepest or most emotionally resonant of the casino films, and it doesn't completely get the psychology of gambling, but it's a lot of fun nonetheless.  It tries to be as slick and as cool as an MTV music video, but it completely busts.  21 blows the endgame when a jarring shift to a con-game finale turns an intriguing drama into just another popcorn movie - the movie equivalent of saying 'hit me' when you've got a 17 showing.  ...a run-of-the-mill, if still satisfying, drama.  Inspired by the real-life story of the M.I.T. students who took Las Vegas casinos for millions, 21 has been reshaped to fit a simple movie template -- and it's nearly as much fun as watching an insurance professional compute actuarial tables.  If the experience of the real-life MIT students who beat Las Vegas was as dreary as 21, what happened in Vegas should have stayed in Vegas.  A movie with an irresistible premise that ultimately collapses around the whole issue of motivation.  Similar to the caper he's shooting, Legally Blonde director Robert Luketic's plan doesn't exactly go off without a hitch.  Real-life rags-to-riches Vegas scheme makes for glossy if lightweight fun.  Repetitive, implausible and overlong.  The end result is still utterly predictable, thoroughly disposable and less true than truthy.  When Spacey and Fishburne really go at each other, 21 finally starts to add up to something.  The movie is oddly structured, taking too long to set up a premise that anyone who has seen an ad for 21 already knows and that I just managed to encapsulate in one sentence.  21 doesn't quite hit the jackpot, but with popcorn it should satisfy.  [21] devoted to the idea that beating Vegas is man's highest purpose.  A none-too-winning blend of the unsettling and the unsurprising.  There's a gap between what we're told about its characters and what we can see for ourselves, a gap that gets larger and more frustrating as the film goes on.  Before sinking into a predictable morality tale, 21 coasts on the superficial thrill of watching casinos take a few hits, but gamblers looking for a how-to lesson on winning in Vegas will be putting their pencils down pretty quickly.  This is really Spacey's picture, from the moment he fixes his gaze on Sturgess to the day when he finally, brutally cuts him loose. It's a fun performance, but a quiet one.  The fascinating story of six college students who took Las Vegas for millions gets dealt a bad hand in 21, which turns their true-life saga into a slick, shallow and thoroughly generic caper flick.  There's enough action here to keep you awake, but don't expect to walk away a winner.  ...a picture that's pleasurable to give in to and go along with.  21 is penny-ante entertainment.  Like a gambler who won't cash in while he's ahead, 21 just keeps playing, hoping another winning hand will turn up even though its luck's run out.  [It's] not unlike feeding one nickel after another into a slot machine in search of a modest payoff.  When the makers of the blackjack drama 21 stepped up to the table to place their bets, they opted to play it safe.  It's glitzy. It's suspenseful. It's a wallow in get-rich-quick ambition. Of course, it's also largely uninhabited. But at least the empty vessels are attractive.  What happened in Vegas should have stayed in Vegas.  Add it up and, in the game that pits your entertainment dollar against entertainment value, know this: The house wins again.  As an adaptation, it's a disappointment. As Hollywood fare, it's a bust.  It's disposable, watchable and forgettable filmmaking for would-be easy millionaires.  The film is about a group of MIT students who used a very smart card-counting system to milk the casinos. But the movie blows off the deeper thrills of its source material to make a tidier, less compelling amorality play.  While you may stick with the film -- it's a slick time-waster -- you never believe it.  By the time the end credits roll around, you realize nothing's actually been risked. It's the gambling equivalent of Go Fish.  Part of "21's" problem as it ups its stakes is that it's about as dangerous and sexy as a $1-minimum keno game. But it's still a mildly tantalizing timewaster about wish fulfillment told with casual confidence before a dragging finale.  21 should have followed Sin City's cardinal rule: What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.  21 is based on a true story. So why does so little of this blackjack drama ring true?  Even gambling novices won't be counting the minutes as this fast-paced, slickly entertaining tale of technically legal collegiate misadventures unspools.  Before you know it, your pockets are empty, your head hurts, and you're really tired of the bright lights and the incessant beeping of the slot machines.  As Ben must learn a lesson, the movie must demonize Micky, whose slick meanness becomes increasingly visible.  [A]lmost entirely preposterous -- never mind that it's apparently based on a true story -- and yet somehow wonderfully entertaining at the same time...  ...an oddly unsatisfying shaggy dog story.  has a flashy, exciting vibe early on to make the audience feel like they are in the middle of that blackjack table and casino (I almost went All In with my popcorn and peanut M&amp;M's)  You have a director so inept that he doesn't even understand what genre he's working within and he's helped destroy potentially one of the most riveting and important social statements about Las Vegas the movies could have seen.  a genial, generic effort attached to an intrinsically interesting premise.  ...the film quickly devolves into an interminable mess of hoary cliches and stale conventions (a trying-on-clothes montage? Really?)  Much like Las Vegas itself, it's only fun in fits, and the next morning you might find yourself regretting spending time with something comprised entirely of surface delights.  None of the main stars is remotely convincing as a smart person.  21 makes for some slick escapist fantasy. Even if, and because, the fantasy has its roots in something real.  Like a seriously troubled gambling addict, 21 shows its hand too early and then stays at the table too long for its own good.  Director Robert Luketic has aimed for a "Casino" 90210 style that works until its third act revenge story takes it beyond the realms of belief.  It's the old Hollywood game of payback in place of amends, which makes for short-term satisfaction but a hollow payoff.  21 is a mini-Ocean's Eleven about, and for, people who are the age of its title.  Greed is good and comes without a hint of conscience in 21, a feature-length bore about some smarty-pants who take Vegas for a ride.  A pulse-poundingly high-spirited and extremely well-directed drama. If 21 is only one thing, it's intoxicating.  It's a would-be parable about greed that emptily celebrates it, a drama about gifted people who are one-dimensional voids and, most laughable of all, a story about the giddiness of risk-taking that safely plays everything by the numbers.  Breezy Vegas con film fun, with some iffy stuff.  "We're not gambling... we're counting," says Kevin Spacey in the new Las Vegas tale 21, which is a very appropriate way to sum up the film itself.  For high-stakes drama, stick with The Price is Right.  Just like blackjack, when they are winning the film is a blast, when they are losing the film gets tedious and trying.  Lack of originality is where 21 really deals a losing hand.  Under Luketic's flaccid direction, 21 is another two-faced moralistic entertainment that shows us how much fun it is to live large, then punishes its characters for acting out our fantasies.  You'll have fun at 21 but will walk out of the theater a little bit lighter in the pocket, wondering where the time went.  21 shares with the Las Vegas mythos the same stale temptations: empty glitz and little substance.  It's funny how movies based on real stories can be the most formulaic and predictable.  A glib, flashy reworking of a story that, shorn of the cheap formulaic frills that have been added to it in the name of merchandising, might have been fascinating.  [Director] Luketic and his screenwriters preserve the excitement and a fair amount of the blackjack strategy -- yet somehow the whole exercise plays like a high-tech John Hughes movie.  Take it from this loss prevention specialist: don't play 21. [Blu-Ray]  The actual process of card counting may fly right over our heads, but the film's smart enough and engaging enough that the math behind it all doesn't much matter.  While I'm firm believer in the adage 'Never let the truth get in the way of a good story,' 21 doesn't spin a good enough yarn to justify all the changes.  Manages to make the act of counting cards seem as exciting as this past winter's Super Bowl -- and as perilous as climbing Mount Everest with both eyes closed.  Jim Sturgess turns up the heat as an untapped genius who takes a walk on the wild side.  21 is built around some standard-issue plot mechanics, but it's still a clever and novel card-sharp thriller.  Numerous inane plot twists and a convenient villain whose behavior defies logic or meaning.  The new blackjack dramedy 21 stands when it should hit, never doubles down and wimps out to the point that it turns a pretty compelling tale into a bust.  Buoyed by the charming Jim Sturgess, and abetted by Messrs. Spacey and Fishburne, 21's sins are certainly forgivable. The cast seems to be having real fun and there's no reason, despite a few lags and holes, that the audience shouldn't either  A movie that wastes a lot of time and money and really, really shoulda stayed in Vegas.  Entertaining fun [but] flawed in its overuse of Hollywood cliches and trickery that makes it predictable and less believable.  The deck may not be the only cardboard character, but this re-telling of an actual event efficiently combines intellect with melodrama.  "21" relies too heavily on music video montages to connect its cardboard characters.  Loose moral messages and flaws in the plot don't add up to screenwriting and directing that draw an ace, but beating the house with intellect will always be a winning hand.  Loosely adapted from Ben Mezrich's best-selling Bringing Down the House, the movie stretches facts like taffy but never shirks its responsibility to entertain.  Because 21 subscribes to the allure of Vegas and not how it is infiltrated with logic and quantification, its details are subordinated in service to familiar cinematic protocol.  Glitzy on the surface, Luketic's fact-inspired fantasy-adventure is yet another Faustian morality tale, but as scripted it defies narrative logic and has too many implausible twists and turns and at le C. Reilly.  shrewdly shuffles together attractive young leads, cagey screen vets and a fantasy-fulfillment scenario in a slickly polished package  In its desperation to deliver an action-packed suspense set piece of an ending, 21 asks the audience to suspend all disbelief, and basically begs to be laughed at.  Luketic's direction and his solid cast keep 21 fun and engaging.  </td>

      <th>21 Jump Street</th>
      <td> Consistently funny and surprisingly self-aware, 21 Jump Street is far better than expected. In fact, it's the best mainstream comedy in recent years.  A lot smarter and a lot funnier than it has any real right to be.  Chaotic and far-fetched yet funny enough to have audiences rolling in the aisles.  Given the broad drama of the series, their movie should be full of big ideas, and instead settles for redundant gags involving drugs, guns, and high school cliques.  The supporting characters add depth to the comedic pairing of Tatum and Hill.  Remake or no, this movie is hysterical.  21 Jump Street gets the remake job done with tongue-in-cheek style &amp; plenty of outrageous moments.  Because of Bacall's skill at writing great comedic material and Lord's and Miller's talent behind the camera, "21 Jump Street" became more than what it originally appeared to be, which is a surprise I'm always grateful for.  21 Jump Street takes the basic concept of the original series, and uses it to create an action/comedy that is not only palatable to modern audiences, but appealing as well.  Co-written, produced by, and stars Jonah Hill, who took exactly the right attitude towards the movie: He and his costar Channing Tatum embraced the stereotypes, laughed at themselves, and came up with a surprisingly funny film.  21 Jump Street is a smartly stupid buddy comedy that plays with the ridiculousness of its set-up.  Interchangeable with dozens of other "dude" comedies that have come before it.  ...feels more like a guerrilla stunt than a soulless and cynical cash grab. Hooray for Hollywood, I guess.  Slick and funny as hell, 21 Jump Street is one of the best comedies of the year.  A raucous, entertaining, and incredibly funny film that respects the premise of the original series...  For an action comedy, "21 Jump Street" had less action or comedy than I expected. It felt as if I spent too much time waiting for something to happen-either for a joke to fire, or a pistol.  The best thing that can be said for it is that it never coasts on just one type of joke; funny in execution, not just in concept.  A floppy cross of high-school movie and buddy-cop comedy. Overdoses on flaccid penis and vagina 'jokes,' indulges in the ain't-this-cool?!ness of a cop-action flick, and passes out on the cliche-couch of bromance.  The movie is perfectly pleasant, a smidgen too aware of itself but consistently sharp.  While the film struggles at the start as Tatum and Hill share little chemistry, they improve minute by minute and are one of the shining lights by the end, their journey boasting a surprising emotional pull.  Feels like it's doing something new with the teen genre, while still acknowledging its debt to the classics that came before it.  t's less fun when the guns come out in the final act, but there's a moment late in the game that redeems the movie's predictable beats, before the whole thing dissolves into entropy and disorder.  21 Jump Street is nothing like the original series. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have a great chemistry and the strong beginning and ending do a pretty good job disguising the flabby middle. It's crass, self effacing, 'meta', stupidity and it works.  Clever, profane and action-packed, '21 Jump Street' fairly leaps onto the big screen as one of the most enjoyable movies of the (still-admittedly young) year.  A high-water mark for recent mainstream comedies. Consistently amusing and frequently uproarious.  Raunchy and profane by design, nothing like the 80s TV show, nonetheless hilarious adult comedy - especially the first hour or so.  Yes, some of the movie's funny bits were in the trailer. After all, they were trying to get you to buy a ticket. But, this is one of the rare comedies that delivers even more than promised.  The best comedy to be released so far this year.  I'm as surprised as you that this film could end up being the funniest of 2012.  Lord and Miller mine the script... for plenty of profane laughs as they set up Hill and Tatum as a hilariously off-kilter comedy duo.  ...it doesn't help, either, that large chunks of the film have been improvised wholesale by the various actors, which only exacerbates the film's excessively slapdash feel.  The late-eighties TV series is rebooted with jolts of sentiment, personal discovery, and wild comedy.  ... latest in endless slew of painful spoofs based on TV shows takes an OK premise and milks it for an occasional chuckle before devolving into a succession of increasingly lame sketches.  They know it's a joke. But like high school itself, 21 Jump Street hits the wall about halfway in and even prom night can't save it.  The humor squeezes just about all the giggle juice it can get out of the R rating. If you need a movie map, this 21 Jump Street is on the FAR side of town from Sesame Street.  by no means a great comedy, but it does demonstrate that playing against the grain can be a good move, especially when the people in charge have run out of ideas  An unlikely (but funny) return to high school  It doesn't matter if you never saw the original, because this movie is a clever, fast-paced, action comedy...  A good-natured must-see for fans of broad, silly comedies with a little something under the surface too. Bright, breezy and brilliant.  It is funny because it is pointed and smart, and it is also funny because it is unusually crass, but the chief takeaway here should be that it is funny.  Rigorous planning likely was involved in taking the dumb concept of "21 Jump Street" and turning it into something that seems so effortlessly brilliant.  While hardly raising the bar in action-comedy, it's still a fun, irreverent, laugh-out-loud take on the beloved, small-screen original.  Halfway through this affable, inspired grab bag of a comedy, it hit me that what I was watching wasn't merely a good movie but the Greatest TV Adaptation Ever Made.  I won't go so far as to say it's good, but 21 Jump Street is certainly better than it has any right to be.  The humor may be coarse and crude but it is funny, and with these movies that is what counts.  21 Jump Street is a cockamamie movie. It's as rowdy as a dick joke. After the 21st dick joke, I wanted to jump off. And after the dick jokes there's a load of excrement jokes.  It's immature, rude and sometimes quite funny, at least until the same gag makes a fourth or fifth lap around the track.  It has a tone all its own: drunk enough to lower the inhibitions; not so drunk that it becomes unintelligible.  Funny and clever but ultimately dispiriting, with a finale that affirms the queasy wink-wink legalized bullying of its early police-vs.-citizens scenes, and that associates manhood with a willingness to kill with a gun -- all for a cheap laugh.  21 Jump Street is as fresh and original a comedy you'll ever find that is based on a totally stolen concept. If only all Hollywood rip-offs could be this good.  Strained and crass comedy.  It is entranced by male bonding, appendages and the chance to enact car chases, and but it's still a fairly filthy, funny flick that does nobody any harm.  It's certainly preferable to any recent Johnny Depp vehicles.  It's also loaded with a series of sidesplitting moments that seem to work on simple brute force.  [Hill and Tatum] are well cast and rather good, as in a knowing way is Ice Cube as their parodically irascible superior.  A scattershot hodgepodge of scatological and penile humor, "21 Jump Street" owes less to Johnny Depp's 1987 television launch pad series than it does to a mentality of lowest common denominator.  A conscious two fingers to the old show's baby po-face.  Maybe I'm just getting too old for this shit.  The most immature R-rated movie I've ever seen. And I've seen all three Jackasses, but this is a good thing.  Overall "21 Jump Street" is an over the top action film with comedy that is not always perfect, but what is perfect is the blast this undercover adventure is!  ... Shows more imagination than most of today's original productions.  It earns its laughs and never takes our affection for granted.  What's most refreshing about the film is how it acknowledges its own narrative absurdities and retreaded tropes in a manner that's neither forced nor self-congratulatory.  "21 Jump Street" is the funniest film of the year so far.  It is smart, silly, straightforward, conceptual, satiric, raunchy, and character-based, all at once. I laughed often and I laughed hard.  Hollywood is obsessed with strip-mining old TV shows and movies for remake fodder these days, but 21 Jump Street is an example of how it can be done well.  tries to be both a comedy and an action film, but only succeeds as a comedy. It's extremely funny, with Hill and Tatum displaying a disturbing amount of chemistry.  Rather than a re-hash of the original, though, this is a re-imagining by Hill, who ... set it in the present with appropriate nods to the original and a whole lot of silliness. Nostalgia has rarely been better served  Adheres to the rule that every TV show is subject to a cinematic rendering, regardless of the strength of its stories, appeal of its characters, or extent of its following.  21 Jump Street on TV is a drama. The movie no way takes itself seriously. That helps. Lots. So does an R-rating where the characters are free to -- uh -- express themselves.  A rude and raucous action comedy spoof, which turns the high-minded, message-laden original series on its head in order to poke fun at everything from Hollywood's desperate recycling of the past to the tired conventions of buddy-cop movies.  Was it because 'The Dukes of Hazzard' and 'The A-Team' worked out so well for us?  This movie embraces everything that should make it lousy, calling out itself for aping the source's bad ideas then flipping the script with meta precision.  TV-based buddy comedy is crude but hilarious.  Tatum shows some range. Hill loses ground.  A great cast, a surprisingly fresh and funny script, and the best non-explosion action scenes on film combine to make 21 Jump Street one of 2012's best comedies.  This is a fine screwball comedy in the old tradition...Ice Cube had me laughing out loud as the profane, angry boss of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum.  Tatum is absolutely hilarious in the movie and not in the unintentional way his stiff performances in romantic dramas like The Vow turn out to be.  One might perceive "21 Jump Street" --- this version --- as strictly for adolescent boys. And yet, for once, I find it satisfyingly entertaining.  It works primarily due to the expert comic timing of its two stars.  It winds up indulging in some of the same buddy-cop cliches that it tries to lampoon.  The whole crew makes clear its affections for action cinema, trashy television and the YouTube generation alike while having fun at the expense of all three.  Other than a few cracks here and there, this particular "Street" is one fun ride.  The idea to play the concept for laughs is an inspired one, and Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum mine the material for all the crass, R-rated comedy that it's worth.  A raucous, raunchy comedy.  The twist that makes this somewhat ragged comedy work as well as it does is that the two cops revert to the level of high-school immaturity as they blend in with the genuine teens around them.  This bracing new take on 21 Jump Street has a playful spark all its own. It's a blast.  Most importantly, it acknowledges how lame reboots are by nature, and how rarely they honor the original.  It does contain several moments that do not seem to realize this and provide some unexpectedly big laughs at the oddest moments.  I am ashamed at how much I laughed at this movie.  Filthy, sweary, sweet and very funny all at the same time.  A deliciously foul-mouthed buddy movie that rides roughshod over political correctness.  Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are an inspired duo.  A try-anything, fitfully amusing muddle that wears its mocking cynicism a bit too proudly.  The film is rude, speedy and outrageous, and we mean that in the best way.  "21" makes clear from the beginning it is gobbling up some pop culture refuse in the name of nothing more than making fun of it and having fun with it.  This is the funniest movie I've seen in more than a year.  "21 Jump Street" might be yet another product of Hollywood's recycling program, but it deserves to be noticed.  Here's a film that's far cleverer than it needs to be, and for that reason alone, we should be grateful.  Perfect blend of action and comedy that doubles as a satire of teen culture and TV to film adaptations. Hill and Tatum are superb leads. Hilarious and fun.  As remakes of '80s properties go, you'd be hard pressed to find one so self-deprecating, yet ruthless.  Eventually, the film does run out of comic steam. But I'd say for 90 percent of its running time, the action and the comedy mix hums along at a terrific pace. This is a real surprise. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)  For its first half this movie does a reasonably clever job of reinvention, though the crudeness level is excessive; but the second half jumps the rails.  Loose and meandering, but it also knows how and when to entertain.  I didn't think we needed a '21 Jump Street,' but it's actually kind of funny.  Funny and smarter than it has any right to be.  21 Jump Street is another re-hash of a largely forgotten Eighties television series - but it's surprisingly enjoyable.  A hit-and-miss hodgepodge of plotting and jokes redolent at least as often of desperation as of inspiration.  Tatum, best known for syrupy romances and action movies, turns out to have crackerjack comic timing and Brie Larson and Dave Franco are standouts.  Miller and Lord clearly understand the push-and-pull and hyper-competitiveness that make guy friendships both complex and stupid.  It's that rare comedy that's funny throughout, with a hilarious story that hinges on the unlikely pairing of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum.  The basic premise -- that these two are supposed to be high school age and siblings -- is funny, but the joke, as is true of many others in this movie, is replayed way too often.  Overlong, but against the odds the usually wooden Channing Tatum is the comedy standout.  21 Jump Street makes a virtue of low expectations, like an underachieving high school burnout coasting on his modest reserves of charm.  Against all odds, 21 Jump Street is an immensely enjoyable, frequently hilarious film.  Frenetic and loud can be funny on its own. But it requires either the finesse to be smart about playing stupid or sheer, balls-out craziness. Disappointingly, this has a hard time choosing between destinations and takes too long to find its way.  This cheerfully chaotic, gleefully vulgar action-comedy retread of the old television series has box-office success written all over it, and where's the harm? It's irresistibly funny until it isn't.  In its outrageous way, 21 Jump Street has real laughs.  It was inevitable that one of Hollywood's many recent reboots would eventually attain sentience. Hence the arrival of 21 Jump Street, a film that not only knows it's a remake, but knows how absurd it has to be to succeed as a remake.  "21 Jump Street" thrilled me to itsy-bitsy elated pieces.  Against all odds, "21 Jump Street" is actually pretty funny and lifts movie comedy out of its recent creative rut.  Neither man has had a better foil. They are literally and figuratively trying to bring something out of each other, and they do.  It's no tribute to the original program, but a wink-happy perversion of the concept, raising hell in its own somewhat tedious, frequently hilarious way.  This film is even better if you come in with no spoilers and low expectations, so we will build it up no more.  ...a ridiculous amount of fun when screenwriter Michael Bacall (of the loathsome "Project X") isn't confusing crassness with comedy.  It's a good thing 21 Jump Street is funny, because in terms of pure filmmaking, it is a near-embarrassment.  Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill play the dimwit cop duo who are sent back to their high school to pose as students in order to root out a drugs ring.  This potty-mouthed and drug-laced reimagining of the 1980s TV show has one of the highest laughs-per-minute ratios since the Naked Gun films.  It's not just a nostalgia-peddling cash-grab, offering raucous laughs contained in a jubilant male-bonding storyline.  Make no mistake, there is a fresh, focused and undeniably funny comedic sensibility that stays to the fore throughout.  Tatum and Hill steamroller any misgivings right from the start. They take a comedy connection that seemed doomed to fail - pairing Tatum's hunky command with Hill's nerdy neediness - and make it look like the most natural thing in the world.  Tatum in particular is a huge surprise. He's always been a pretty face, but here (as in his recent SNL outing) he displays comedic chops we never saw coming.  A raucous, obscene comedy that sustains its single strong joke for an extraordinarily long time.  Much of the humor involves trotting out cliches from cop movies and teen movies, then commenting on how dumb they are.  For all the personal growth that our two boys in blue are supposed to experience during the course of their mission, you might think that lessons about callous expressions of misogyny and homophobia might fit into the mix.  21 Jump Street earns my genial nod because of its limber, 120-IQ take on the whole notion of movie revivals.  Writers Hill and Michael Bacall cleverly mix pop culture references, wit, and vulgarity to transform what might have been a one-joke knock-off into a comic original.  The comedy revels in putting dumb and/or inept spins on cinematic formulas. It results in a shoddy movie, but one that is bad in rather interesting ways.  The makers of 21 Jump Street clearly understood that almost nobody really wanted a 21 Jump Street movie, and they've cleverly used a familiar property as a way to get a wildly entertaining new comedy made.  Big surprise: The sometimes chaotic "Jump Street" is a lot of ridic fun, as the kids say, turning predictability on its head.  The saving grace of "21 Jump Street," co-written and produced by Hill, is its obvious affection for teen genres, and for teenagers.  Unlike its semi-serious inspiration, the new "Jump Street" is a rowdy mix of comedy, satire and sass.  Provided you approach this laff-a-minute, slapstick adventure as a franchise overhaul rather than as an homage, you won't be shocked by its relentlessly-irreverent brand of humor. Think Superbad meets Revenge of the Nerds!  Shoulda, coulda, woulda been fun. But it ain't.  Of the horde of big-screen redo's of one-time TV hits, who'd have thought 21 JUMP STREET would be the one to get it right?  Apart from the general premise, it's completely different from the television show; although it does pay a few well-timed homages.  Luckily, the temptation to be become truly gross is resisted.  "21 Jump Street" is the address for movie fun this week.  Even if you think you've graduated from genital jokes and violent slapstick, the laughing gas around "21 Jump Street" may get you hooked.  Together Hill and Tatum are so much fun to watch that it's disappointing when the story around them becomes overly cluttered and convoluted.  One of the freshest mainstream comedies in years.  The film makes high school comedy feel young again: considering its stars are in their late 20s and early 30s, that's no mean feat.  Remake whatever you want if it's this funny.  Completely abandoning earnest teenagers-in-crisis melodrama in favor of crude, aggressive comedy, this "21 Jump Street" is an example of how formula-driven entertainment can succeed.  It manages to achieve a balance between the action and spoofery due to sure-handed direction and a cast that really dives into the mayhem.  The material may be a bit too hit-and-miss to justify the 109-minute duration, but viewers will leave this film with a big smile, wishing that all trawls through the Eighties archives could be so freshly rethought.  It's a rowdy, massively entertaining ride done with wild wit and creative abandon. Now, bring on the sequel!  It's mostly another raunchy buddy comedy - albeit one with welcome comic discipline, more focused on maintaining pitch than continually lowering the bar on gross-out jokes.  Less an adaptation than an "adaptation" that delights in highlighting the ridiculous cliches and tropes it lampoons.  Here's the last movie I was expecting with this title. In other words, "21 Jump Street" is pretty good.  If you're a fan of the original 21 Jump Street, prepare to have your memories desecrated. Everyone else, strap yourself in for some dumb explosive fun.  Mediocre jokes built around recycled ideas.  There's some good comedy as their expectations of school life are turned on their head (everyone's caring and politically correct) and Tatum's hunk finds himself bonding with the science nerds, while Hill's fatty is cast as Peter Pan.  What makes 21 Jump Street so funny and exciting and lovable is all the stuff you don't see coming.  What was the last stupid Hollywood comedy -- good-stupid, not stupid-stupid -- to offer actual, audible, verifiable big laughs?  You'd expect at 21 Jump Street remake to suck, and this film, for all its obviousness in delivery, doesn't.  It's lazily content to raise laughs through 4-letter words and penis jokes. In other words, it has absolutely no ambition, so that eventually even the efforts of its lead actors amount to very little.  21 Jump Street proves that you can reinvent the wheel and pay homage to its past in one very funny package.  Its two leads possess amusing chemistry but this smug and ultimately disappointing revamp never manages to strike the right note between action and comedy.  It's part homage and part wink at the past. It jokes about high school but is also a sensitive sociological study of those crucial years. It bridges slapstick and action. It's quick-witted with its pop references.  If Hill keeps signing on for half-hearted romps into the realm of idiocy like The Sitter and 21 Jump Street, he's going to get shoved aside by whatever chubby comic wunderkind is lurking behind him.  Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller get nearly everything -- the tone, the self-referential nods to the show and the dead-solid-perfect surprises -- just right.  Yes, there are laughs to be had here, but I wonder whether it might be more amusing to watch episodes of the old TV show.  With all due disrespect to its source, 21st century Jump Street is both dope and dopier.  Sharply written, frequently hilarious high school-slash-cop comedy with terrific comic performances from Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, though it could have done with a slight trim in the running time department.  Silly slapstick, spoofing the series by playing it for laughs.  Thanks to charming leads and a smattering of laughs, this is still worth a punt for fans of light buddy comedies.  Rather than treat the late-'80s source material as holy kitsch, the filmmakers have reconceived this tale of illegal narcotics and arrested adolescence as a viciously satirical, unapologetically crude buddy comedy.  This is not a property requiring respect and devotion to the source material to satisfy longtime fans, so the filmmakers wisely make a "21 Jump Street" all their own.  Though these mismatched cops bounce well off each other, Tatum, in his first comedic lead role, is the better performer, both more riotous and affecting.  Not everything... works, and if you're actually looking for a consequential night at the movies you might want to stay away, but for a goofy fun Friday night this gets the job done.  For a film rehashing a long-forgotten TV series and starring the sentient muscle Channing Tatum, 21 Jump Street is surprisingly good.  Only mildly amusing, a film that was probably a lot funnier in the writers' room than it is on the screen.  Like many almost-great comedies, 21 Jump Street is frontloaded with the best go-for-broke gags and lines.  An often hilarious comedy filled with vulgar dialogue, slapstick antics, and great chemistry between the principals.  It would have been impressive if the 21 Jump Street movie was any good. The fact that it's flat-out great feels like showboating by directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller.  [F]ueled almost entirely by an appreciation of its own ridiculousness, yet one that balances the absurdity with some smart truths... It's tough to be sensitive about the silly, but directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller... pull it off.  Pleasant, unexpected surprise, this feature remake of the TV series that had starred Johnny Depp is entertaining as comedy-actioner, due to Jonah Hill's acting and chemistry with Channing Tatum.  It's completely lunatic and sort of a mess. It's also the funniest high-school comedy to come out of Hollywood in ages.  There is a frantic highway chase, a high-voltage gunfight and the obligatory chaotic party; those elements plus the pimple squeezing fun of high school clashes make 21 Jump Street the movie we had to have when the TV series should have been enough  The humour is pretty lame, so leave your brain at the door, but there are some funny juxtapositions  21 Jump Street is that rarest of comedies, a classic in the making that manages to become both more outrageous and hilarious as it bounds along.  Canny enough to know how to laugh with its subject, not at it, 21 Jump Street is a lot of fun thanks to a fast-flying, clever script and affectionate regard for its 1980s television roots.  Tatum and Hill make for a fun duo, the former seemingly have the time of his life playing up the dumb hottie his succession of histrionic, corny roles have ultimately typecast him as.  Pickles and ice cream. Bacon and cupcakes. Chocolate and potato chips. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. Some pairings shouldn't work, yet somehow the result is delicious.  Jonah Hill is masterful at delivering an absurd story with so much sweetness, the nonsense ceases to get in the way.  This is one of those movies that is much better than expected, but is still for a specific audience.  An irreverent reboot that only half-heartedly scratches the surface of the more intriguing comedy of young male anxiety at which it hints, but still sails on the strength of some of its joke writing, and the chemistry and use of its stars.  [Jonah Hill] is, despite early expectations, the emotional anchor in all of his movies. Fear not though: Phil Lord and Chris Miller's 21 Jump Street proves he can still bring the funny.  A smart and immensely entertaining comedy that announces the somewhat surprising arrival of a serious comic talent in the shape of Channing Tatum.  </td>

      <th>28 Hotel Rooms</th>
      <td> ... one of the movie's points is that when you are cocooned with your lover, intoxicated and infatuated, you don't care much about the rest of the world  The movie's conceit grows a bit stale even with a short running time, and ultimately the whole thing feels more like an acting workshop than a full-fledged human story.  It's an intriguing and well-acted, if gimmicky and repetitive, cinematic experiment that nevertheless feels emotionally detached.  Not sexy, profound or memorable despite heartfelt performances by Chris Messina and Marin Ireland. It's ultimately an exhausting and frustrating affair.  "28 Hotel Rooms" slowly expires for lack of air.  A chamber piece rooted in semi-improvisation.  While Messina and Ireland are fine company, writer-director Matt Ross' conceit tires you out.  In eliminating all the filler, it ends up feeling like nothing but.  Dismaying affectations aside-the characters go needlessly unnamed-the movie articulates the enduring allure of a love defined, and heightened, by restrictions.  The intimate romantic drama "28 Hotel Rooms" should prove a fine calling card for its first-time writer-director, Matt Ross.  We're supposed to take their self-pity at face value, an impression that's emphasized by a grinding monotonous humorlessness.  A smart, incisive examination of how every love affair eventually comes with strings attached.  In its own small way, in documenting two people who want to be together but are too scared to commit, Twenty-Eight Hotel Rooms is masterful.  Lacking much dramatic or intellectual stimulation, it's ultimately a limp effort.  </td>

      <td> Loud, callow, jejune, infantile, puerile and annoying as hell.  3 Ninjas was a surprising box-office hit with the Saturday matinee family crowd, earning the highest cost-to-profit ratio of that year and instantly mandating this all-too-unnecessary sequel.  3 Ninjas Kick Back is just as lively and engaging as the 1992 original  Fantasy is one thing. 3 Ninjas Kick Back is something else entirely: junk food laced with testosterone.  Clearly made with an eye on the international market, this movie is set for the most part in Japan, shrewdly adding a female ninja to the three boys, thus broadening the potential demographics.  Worse than the first one. These kids are no Spy Kids.  Instead of exalting physical grace and virtuosity, this film's slapdash action sequences resort repeatedly to the old trick of accelerating the action to the speed of a silent-film chase.  Even worse than the original ... which was pretty dire to begin with.  If this first sequel is any indication, however, the 3 Ninjas franchise has already run out of steam.  All movies hope to turn a buck, though few of them actually attain this goal (at least, not in any substantial measure). Then there are movies whose only goal is to turn a buck.  Who was this movie made for? Not for me, that's sure, but I have a hunch younger kids will find it satisfying.  Filled with martial-arts action, bathroom humor, and slapstick, 3 Ninjas Kick Back even has a politically correct kicker: The champion ninja is a girl.  </td>

      <td> It's Assault on Precinct 13 meets the The Thing with vampires as the baddies (Can we count the ways director John Carpenter has influenced genre films today?).  30 Days of Night is a great example on how to combine chills, thrills and gore with the end result a serious and effective horror movie.  These 30 Days feel like an eternity  Scrapping many of the undead cliches and aided by troublingly realistic special effects, Slade has crafted one hell of a monster movie.  About as scary as Count Chocula.  Not bad, but let's just say the movie could have used a tad more intentional humor.  30 Days of Night aspires to be little more than a movie-movie, where you're supposed to enjoy the ride, without asking any questions.  ... [T]he hissing foreign-language chatting vampires, with all pointy teeth, make for dull, screaming villains.  The action is fast and gruesome, but beyond Niles and Templesmith's unique setting, in which the typical race to daylight is stretched out to an agonizing marathon, '30 Days of Night' offers little to stir the imagination.  Frankly, after you've seen one writhing, orgiastic vampire feeding, you've seen them all.  This isn't my favourite genre, but it's evident that the film delivers all the requisite elements for fans itching to sit through decapitations, body ripping and blood-soaked, tooth gnashing devourings directed in as fresh a way as is possible.  I was done when there was a needless scene abusing a woman. And the ending was on the verge of interesting, until it came down to one little punch.  The coolest vampire movie since Near Dark.  30 Days of Night reinvents the vampire movie, but only with its novel premise.  It certainly does entertain, particularly for those who consider a man chopping off the head of one of his friends...entertaining. Twice!  Concept: excellent. Setup: intriguing. Execution: well... too many interesting ideas bungled.  aniso thriler poy mpalatzarei anamesa sti mpimoybiariki anapologitikotita toy kai ti mpantmoybiariki ektelesi toy, kai dihos na mporei na anaparastisei peistika tin komikistiki aisthitiki tis pigis empneysis toy, parapataei me epiloges poy toy prokyptoyn  Feels derivative of 28 Days Later.

It would be fun to rent with friends who talk back to movies and imbibe a little ETOH to facilitate the witty comebacks. Compared to the other Halloween offerings out there this year, 30 Days of Night is really pretty decent value for your money. Great  an okay flick  Redeems the vampire sub-genre, yanking it from the abysmal depths...  Overall, the film is freaky and gruesome enough to keep horror fans thrilled, especially as the monsters get stronger, faster, badder and nuttier.  30 Days Of Night has a terrific premise and an intriguing setting, but it's badly let down by poor direction, dismal acting and an appalling script.  A real baying-at-the-moon gorefest, unusual both for its savagery and for a half-decent performance from Hartnett.  Adapted from the graphic novel by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith, 30 Days of Night is so dead serious you may feel the frequent urge to poke it in the ribs.  If you are looking for a genuinely scary Halloween film, this is a good bet.  30 Days of Night has a striking comic-book aesthetic and macabre sense of fun - if your sense of fun includes watching a vampire turned into pate in the gnashing metal jaws of a rubbish processor.  The portrayal of small-town dynamics amid the loneliness of the frozen North is more artful than the frenzied, sloppy, shaky-camera fangwork.  An extremely gory but never completely gripping horror.  A refreshing variation on the vampire movie formula, with a strong premise and a fair bit of splatter, but insufficient verve to last out its nearly two hour running time.  Good idea, boring execution.  I've seen more creepy vampires, I guess. But the thought of waiting out the ghouls in "30 Days of Night" is pretty interesting.  This has more bite than we've come to expect from Sam Raimi's Ghost House production outfit. Some of the action misses the jugular, but Danny Huston makes for a sensational baddie.  A frustrating mix of imaginative design, erratic plotting and underwritten characters.  In comparison to recent anaemic vampire offerings, it does make your blood run cold - assuming you've got any left.  This slick and sticky horror is the most accomplished treatment of vampire lore since Near Dark.  30 Days Of Night strikes out a nerve-jangling, bloodily unpredictable route to a truly stunning ending that's well worth the wait.  The isolated, unique nature of the town's plight keeps the film from tapping directly into universal fears, but it will certainly make you grateful to see the sun rise  Great setup, a mediocre middle, and no follow through make this story a swing and a miss, although an entertainingly bloody mess to watch.  They are counting the number of days to the sun and I was counting the number of minutes to the end.  Director David Slade is clearly of the opinion that more is more, so there is lots of blood, lots of gore, and lots of vampires in black coats standing around as if auditioning for a remake of the Michael Jackson Thriller video.  It's not quite torture porn, but there are lots of flying body parts to play with. And that flyin' body part fan base is really going to have a good time with it.  The problem is structural. After the invasion, we're marooned with the dull survivors.  The vampire's attacks are nicely manic - think of an over-zealous contestant at a pie eating contest -- but they get repetitive after the first few kills.  The unscary 30 Days of Night has shallow bite.  Potentially biting off more than he can chew, Hard Candy indie director David Slade moves on from pedophile revenge fantasy to a ravenous Alaskan vampire buffet.  a vampire film of unusually grave conviction, way too cold for camp.  your best choice for fun frights before a night of track or treating.  A terrific horror premise goes begging in the garbled Halloween offering 30 Days of Night.  The premise is slightly intriguing, but the execution is blander than Josh Hartnett's screen presence.  A somewhat shrug-inducing vessel of unfulfilled potential, consisting of solidly executed attack passages followed by great stretches of relative tedium.  30 Days is gory, graphic, suspenseful and occasionally nonsensical. But it's a vampire movie and if you're into that genre you'll probably be into this.  Let's call this one 'Vampire Movies for Dummies', complete with our hero (John Hartnett) having the job of solemnly stating the obvious as a pseudo narrator.  It has a fairly original premise and some blood-curdling moments, but it's also predictable, repetitive and vile.  If the comic book had never existed, this would be pretty cool. As is, it's a slightly missed opportunity with enough fun parts that it doesn't feel like a total waste.  Now if you dig vampire flicks that will gross you out and are filled with gory set pieces, then maybe the high number of ax decapitations will catch your fancy.  It's not a classic, but it's good blood-spattered fun.  Final analysis: vampires cool; humans suck. Go read the comic.  Bleak, bombastic and belligerent, Slade's blood-busting bohemians will indeed take a caustic chunk out of your imaginative horrifying souls.  Danny Huston is the vampire leader. Who knew that vampires look like traveling salesmen, belly up to the bar at the Holiday Inn by the highway in Poughkeepsie? 'It's time to sink my teeth into a free breakfast buffet,' says Danny.  Decent vampire movies are few and far between, and I'm having a hard time remembering a recent one that impressed me like 30 Days of Night.  Gone are filmdom's traditional seductive vampires, but '30 Days of Night' still contains chills and thrills galore.  Slade doesn't skimp on the gore, or on the disturbing imagery of these fast-moving vampires... hunting the townsfolks through the snow.  If this is the kind of movie you're looking for, it delivers.  You may not believe there's any more blood to suck from the shriveled corpse of the vampire movie, but you'd be wrong.  30 Days of Night redonne ses lettres de noblesses a monstre edente depuis des annees, pour ne pas dire des decennies.  Your enjoyment of Hollywood's latest vampire flick, 30 Days of Night, is largely going to depend on how forgiving you are towards the flaws of the Underworld movies.  In order to enjoy the best, you have to put up with the worst... and rarely have "best" and "worst" commingled quite so completely.  The most impressive effect in 30 Days of Night is Danny Huston's haircut.  At its core, 30 Days of Night is a siege Western relocated to the frozen north.  The premise of this film has just got to be the ultimate wet dream for your average vampire.  Director Slade has fashioned a horror film that, for all its narrative shortcomings, succeeds at what it set out to do: make vampires scary again and terrify audiences doing it.  30 Days of Night is the kind of gruesome but entertaining survival guide you pray you never have to follow: how to stop vampires killing you during the darkest days of Alaskan winter.  30 Days of Night manages to do for the vampire genre what 28 Days Later did for the zombie flick: give age-old monsters a modern-day makeover.  Vampires stage a blood orgy in a tiny Alaskan town that spends a month of every year sunk in the darkness of polar winter in this gory adaptation of Steve Niles' popular graphic novel.  It's clear the film script has gone through the standard Hollywood death-of-a-thousand-rewrites wringer to emerge as shadow of its former self, drained of much of its creative synergy.  It's an unusually thoughtful chiller.  Fleshing out their minimalist story in a way that won't cause the blood to drain from fans' faces, it's one of the better recent efforts as both a comic adaptation and a fright flick.  30 Days of Night is the well-paced and entertaining horror debut of Hard Candy director David Slade, who captures the coolest parts of Steve Niles' comic book series on the big screen.  A truly terrifying hell-ride through darkness for grownups.  30 Days of Night is a high-concept movie idea that's so good, I'm surprised we haven't seen it.  Director David Slade takes the film adaptation halfway home by getting the look exactly right.  Whatever power the original comic had, this film adaptation lost it in translation.  You could make a horror film with shocking story developments and creepy twists. Or, you could just have monsters with pointy teeth jump into the frame while making loud noises. For the latter, check out the vampire flick 30 Days of Night.  The increasingly ridiculous behavior of some of the other humans turn the film laughable by interrupting its brutality with banality. And when it comes to vampires, brutal is always better.  An anemic adaptation of Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith's creepy comic series, 30 Days of Night is lighter on horror than it is on inadvertent humor.  See the movie for the vampires, which are at least visually interesting. The humans are so boring I couldn't wait for them to die.  30 Days of Night isn't deep, but it's effective, and at least it doesn't seem like something you've seen a dozen times before.  Even as stage blood flows like water, this wicked-mean vampire thriller pushes ahead with effective characters, a fantastic visual schema and a terrifying plot.  Like most kiddies games, this one starts out fun and then gets tired. Inevitably, that's when Slade tries to revive our interest by upping the gore quotient.  Eventually, the film just runs out of fresh bodies -- sadly, about 29 days after it's run out of fresh ideas.  Even when it resorts to the hoariest cliches, 30 Days of Night still chills.  The filmmakers have tried to expand the original source material by adding more characters to the mix. But as a result, it actually feels character-thin and a little sketchy.  30 Days the movie conjures the ominous atmosphere that haunted the graphic novel, but squanders much of the rest.  I have pretty much reached my quota for vampire movies, but I shouldn't hold that against this one. If you haven't seen too many, you might like it.  30 Days is a proficient, atmospheric fangfest that does nothing you haven't seen before but still does it passably well.  30 Days of Night turns so monotonous and repetitive that, by the end, you feel as if you've lived through an entire month of Black Sundays.  ...works in its updating of ancient folk lore, but wears us down with its extended jack hammering approach.  A fresh, gruesomely fun take on the bloodsucking creatures.  Scary is back in the cold deadly way. This horror film contained all the necessary ingredients for a classic fright.  The humans are a bore, but the vampires light up this Night.  This is a failed fright flick that is so inspired by Stephen King that the famous horror scribe should consider suing.  ...a horror film as dim as its prevailing palette, a graytoned fugue set in the blankness of the Alaskan Arctic.  The performers have little to do besides spill and drink blood in this tedious, inconsequential B picture. The sun doesna(TM)t rise nearly fast enough.  It's the Bourne Ultimatum of horror movies... It is Ghost House Pictures' first great film. Actually, it's their first good film but it's a great one.  The producers just had to give the material to director David Slade, a hack filmmaker of the worst kind, who drowns any promise this nihilistic tale of frosty survival held by smothering the picture in excessive, pedestrian visual gymnastics.  Nearly passes muster on atmosphere alone.  The concept? Brilliant... The execution? Oh, dear.  A bloody bore that utilizes lots of CGI blood and rapid-fire visual glitz in a doomed effort to cover up the fact that there is nothing going on here that even the least committed consumer of vampire-related entertainment hasn't seen many times before  For a horror picture being released only weeks before Halloween, 30 Days of Night doesn't thrill and it definitely doesn't spook.  Why see the same old Saw when you have a chance to see the best and scariest vampires you have seen in a long time?  So the remaining survivors huddle together. A few get bitten and turn. Some splatter kills in-between. Remind me again of what exactly is 'groundbreaking' about this.  ...a breath of fresh air amidst the relentless deluge of watered-down, teen-oriented cash grabs and remakes.  30 Days of Night amounts to two hours of missed opportunities.  A frightening genre offering, raising the bar on raising the dead.  With such a good concept for a vampire movie, it's hard to believe it turned out to be this boring.  The rare horror film that actually lives up to its potential.  30 Days of Night sparks with crackling energy. It's a symphony of shocks.  The same conflict over and over is not frightening. Once it collapses under the weight of its own preposterousness and lack of suspense, it doesn't matter how many cool-looking vampires screech like feral beasts- the movie has already lost all its blood.  Here's a story set in a place where people are almost as impervious to cold as vampires, and roads remain plowed even after a blizzard.  Not only is 30 Days of Night the first fright flick in a long time to be chilling in every way, it's also the one to return our fangy friends to their rightful frightfulness.  30 Days hangs on a pretty cool conceit.  This is the perfect film to help you get a head start on Halloween.  This high-concept vampire film suffers from a disappointingly low-concept approach.  This is a full-on, non-stop horror film. You're either on the bus or off the bus. But if you are on, you're hanging on with both hands and your hair flying back for the better part of the movie.  This is a gory, nasty movie that never gives its characters or its audience a moment's rest.  Hartnett has the same empty, mildly worried look in his eyes all the time, whether or not he's a vampire.  The film moves from truly creepy to truly inane.  These vamps could use stakes as toothpicks and garlic as garnish on their meals of human flesh. Their only weaknesses are a well-swung ax to the jugular and sunlight. Much like Larry King.  Certainly bloody, but not bloody good...doesn't go the tongue-in-cheek route, but by the close it's pretty risible.  During bad movies my mind often drifts toward better ones, which explains why 30 Days of Night reminded me of High Noon.  Result is a mixed bag but has a catchy premise and quite enough splatter to satisfy gorehounds.  The script is simple stuff, simpler than the graphic novel, which at least managed to devote a page or two to the vampires' back story.  Despite the clever twist of fighting vampires with an ultraviolet lamp (good thing grandma grew pot), this horror-flick fondue settles into an extended cat-and-mouse sequence dotted with the occasional dollop of gore.  more likely to induce a coma than a nightmare  Rises above its source material, both in plot and gut-rumbling tone. Even accounting for a few logy sequences, it's the most relentless, sustained freak-out since The Descent.  Doomed to have its best scenes mistakenly remembered as parts of better movies.  [A] turd covered in tasty Ghirardelli chocolate - as soon as you sink your teeth in you know you've got mouthful of sweetened sh*t.  You can't have horror without suspense. Don't they teach the films of Alfred Hitchcock anymore in film school?  You can only see so many snarling hissy fits by vampires with perpetually bloody chins before they start looking less like monsters and more like ill-tempered circus clowns whose makeup is running.  30 Days of Night is relentless, but it's also relentlessly one-note.  Commendable for its daring, unconventional vision of vampires, but its erratic pacing makes it a jarring experience that's hard to adjust to.  Pushes things into violent, hardcore territory all too similar to Danny Boyle's zombie-outbreak flick 28 Days Later and its 2007 sequel.  The movie's just not very scary.  David Slade hasn't revolutionized the vampire genre, but he may make you wet your pants.  no amount of desensitization can prepare you for David Slade's chilling vampiric bloodbath. 30 Days of Night is relentlessly brutal horror with nary a comedic wisecracker in sighola film with expert contributions from some master craftsmen. But the story is full of arcane references that many will find nonsensical, and the performances are a letdown.  30 Days of Night grabs this hoary monster by the throat, pumps it full of the thick rich blood of life, and shoves it out to greet you, eat you, and coat you in glorious mists of red firing from oh-so-many newly exposed arterial sprays.  </td>

      <td> Our instinctual desire to sneer at the implausibility of the story is stalled by a sense of ambition that seems unmatched even by the standards of the Hollywood assembly line.  So manly it makes Troy look like a Mary-Kate and Ashley adventure.  Wallowing in the same adolescent nihilism as his Sin City, this adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel suffers from a similar lack of momentum.  As the first blockbuster of the year, 300 sets the bar high enough, and is enjoyably silly.  Despite a cracking central premise and outstanding visuals, 300 ultimately leaves you feeling more gutted than some of the disemboweled soldiers on display throughout the movie.

Asscrack-ugly  [Snyder] twists the brawn and battle into a cartoonish FX extravaganza with severed body parts and globules of blood flying across the screen.  300 is a fun-fest of blood, mayhem, and absurdity. At its best, it is entertaining; when it's not at its best, it's pretty dumb. It's pretty dumb much of the time.  300 has one-dimensional caricatures who talk like professional wrestlers plugging their next feud.  Zack Snyder's film version of the graphic novel by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley may look like the greatest music video ever made; whether or not it is a decent feature film is another question altogether.  This is death and war as ancient poets might have imagined it, glorious and provocative ... 300 is a powerhouse actioner.  All this bellowing and testosterone gets old fast -- especially since there's not much of a plot outside of the combat scenes, and the not-much-of-a-plot scenes are laden with dialogue worthy of Anakin and Padme.  The look and feel of this historic battle is perfect for the virtual backgrounds and obscene violence. Again, trust me on the violence.  300 is an orgy of gore, a blood-letting on a titanic scale, a ballet of butchery in which half-naked men and the torrents of blood they elicit move in perfect, slow-motion choreography to a thunderous soundtrack. And I loved every minute of it.  Machismo, thy name is Sparta!  I still wish David Wenham weren't the narrator, but everything else about the movie is a brutal kind of hypnotic that keeps me coming back.  Bloody, fanboyish retelling of an ancient battle.

God save us all.  While far from sophisticated in its 'I have filled my heart with hate' messaging, it resonates with the 'us versus them' worldview that's wildly popular in some circles.  300 is poorly-executed, bare-bones storytelling that is hoping and praying no one notices. I did.  An overwrought, revved-up, and deeply silly symphony of clanging steel and spurting blood.  ...relentless in its attempt to recreate the graphic novel's vision of the carnage at Thermopylae.

In this handsome pantomime, the performances are not what we are watching.  It's an enjoyable two hours.  Como adaptacion de un comic al cine, 300 es visualmente impactante. Pero una vez que uno se acostumbra queda solo la historia, y alli no hay nada nuevo, original, ni sorprendente.  It is violent enough to make you shudder and close enough to fascist art to make your skin crawl.  The Spartan soldiers, carrying shields like dustbin lids and spears like park railings, have shiny rippling bodies, wear black leather Speedos and short red cloaks, and seem to be responding to an invitation to a fancy-dress party at a gay New York club.  Reduces the violence of battle to cartoonish proportions that make the film as a whole much less involving than it should be.  The thing about 300 is its visual style, after all, and this is where the film's real stars shine  Moralmente repreensivel e narrativamente fragil. Ainda assim, e um filme contagiante cuja beleza plastica chega quase a compensar por todos os seus demais problemas.  The hyper-real blue screen and the moral complexity of root veg remains faithful to Miller. But you can't help feeling this could have had more to say about war than "come join the party!".  300 is an impressive spectacle, but after so much fighting and self-important speechifying, I just wanted them to get it over with and die.  A muscle-magazine fantasy crossed with a video game and an Army recruiting film.  This graphic novel turned action thriller is definite empty-headed fun.  This is a gorgeously designed, impressively directed and action-packed swords-and-sandals flick, even if the fascist overtones and the shouting gets a bit much after a while.  Apart from anything else, the idea of America having the Spartans' underdog status is not plausible.  There's so much testosterone pumping through the new film 300 that the screen seems to sweat the male hormone.  Visually stunning, thoroughly belligerent and as shallow as a pygmy's paddling pool, this is a whole heap of style tinged with just a smidgen of substance.  Ancient history may be Greek to me, but 300 packages it like a Happy Meal -- bloated with empty calories and too much cheese but still very tasty. Boy toys included.  300 was as pathetically puerile as I had expected.  What we have is a vulgar and over- dramatic retelling of the Battle of Thermopylae. But as vulgar and over-dramatic retellings of history go, this one is not bad.  ...some rousing battles and an aura of the misty, unreachable past that few movies can even hint at.  Silly, stylish, and entertaining.  Contains some wow moments visually, but little else.  Call it an attempt to jumpstart our imagination or a metaphoric map to rediscovering our inner joy, but 300 is built for spectacle, not scholarship.  It's not a film I have a lot of affection for and it's not one I'm eager to see again, but I appreciate the skill with which the movie was made.  As silly as it is stylish...  A film whose primary purpose is to entertain the male ego.  The devotion to sameness means that a disappointing subplot involving Gorgo is set off awkwardly: she doesn't fit aesthetically the rest of the tableau.  It might have been one of the great all-time mad, bad movies but for one thing - it's just sooo boring.  Taken on it's own terms - as Greek myth meets Looney Tunes - it's kind of a masterpiece.  Snyder's take isn't a transcendent epic, rather, an entertaining comic book one.  Zack Snyder has created one of the most stylish and intense comic book movies ever made-period.  ... a movie that wishes it were a 'rated M for mature' video game.  It helps nothing that the movie is also so very, very hilarious. Deliciously, gloriously, unintentionally hilarious.  By Zeus, where do I sign up for the Crusades?  Depersonalizes the major players to such a degree that one ends up feeling more sympathy for the shields that end up receiving the brunt of the sword blows and arrow piercings.  A good bargain, in that you get exactly what they promise, but only that. But if that's what you want, man, you won't be disappointed.  Worst of all, it's a phony spectacle. It's less like watching a movie than it's like watching a parade of production-design sketches flow across the screen.  While the film is an inspired bit of production design, ingeniously conceived and skillfully crafted, what it ultimately lacks in its final, sweeping gestures is any sense of gravity.  Every few years, a film comes along that epitomizes what it means to be cool. The Matrix earned that honor in 1999. 300 earns it now.  '300' delivers what legions of moviegoers are looking for -- sure-handed, confident, blustery filmmaking, done mainly on computer.  'I am the God-King,' said Xerxes, 'and I have the gold-encrusted Speedo and the encyclopedic knowledge of the lyrics of Guys and Dolls to prove it!'  Whatever your reason for going into 300, I can't imagine leaving it very excited by what you get. I can imagine being excited by the prospect of leaving -- for me, the end credits of 300 rolled up on the screen with the comforting shock of a parole notice  A film that's full of violence and testosterone and fills in the story holes with gorgeous slaughter. But isn't that what the trailers promised?  Until the wheels come off, 300 has about it a certain lean, alien quality.  Essentially a stylish comic book-style remake of a 1962 movie, The 300 Spartans.  How much cooler is a storyteller's epic tale when you can watch all the embellishments? After viewing 300, your answer may be 'infinitely.'  A monochromatic, testosterone-sodden cross of Gladiator and Sin City strictly for the bloodlust demographic.  A landmark motion picture, a spectacular visual feast that is as inventive and groundbreaking as 'The Matrix'.  This is not your father's sword and sandals epic; it's more like your teenage brother's video game.  There's such a crushing rush of testosterone on display in "300," those who turn out to see it might leave the theater with an unexpected surprise--male pattern baldness. But don't fret. It's such a lightweight, the effects will be gone by morning.  The film is little more than a colorfully stylish, throwaway epic, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with something that simply aims to be populist entertainment.  Apart from its pro-war propaganda, that comes in the form of unrelenting voice-over narration, "300" is a dog of a movie where cookie-cutter CGI battle scenes show thirty actors pretending to fight to the death.  Part of the fascination of the Thermopylae story is that it really happened, and it helped define real heroism. There's nothing remotely like reality to be had in this film.  As to this pumped-up spectacle's other aims, it's anybody's guess: selling gladiatorial chest-beating as beefcake erotica? Combining a movie and its own video-game spin-off into one package? Being both a dessert topping and a floor wax?  300 explodes off the screen in IMAX. It is the only way to see this epic picture.  That brings us back to the battle sequences and the visuals, and let me tell you, they are everything you are expecting and more.  The kids just want to have fun. Many of them will. But what does that say about another Greek contribution -- Western civilization?  If it's comic books you want, you'll love this look at Spartans versus Persians. Even better in IMAX, but don't expect much story to go along with the sound and fury.  The movie swings back and forth from awesome to awful so regularly and rapidly that it's like a jai alai match.  If the movie's neocon message is as thin as a politician's excuse, that's to be expected. But what's surprising here is that the sights are just as meagre.  The picture achieves a heightened, painterly quality in its imagery. Also artistic is the fight choreography, where assured control of slow motion and other speed effects achieve a balletic rhythm in battle.  Instead of "Prepare for Glory!" it should be "Prepare for Gory!" It's a vividly stylized, spectacular, uber-violent video game.  You never forget that you're watching a movie, but that's very much part of the point.  You don't go to Hooters for the chicken wings - no matter what you might tell your wife - and you're not going to 300 for the plot nuances.  Filled from first frame to last with images that are meant to burn themselves into your memory and force you to tell your friends about what you just saw.  Like a Hong Kong 'pistol opera' only without any pistols, or shirts. I guess it's more of a 'nipple opera'.  Primally, 300 has a grunting, gut impact...Primarily, it's constructed of fudged history and creative slaughtering, making it a somewhat disturbing American busman's holiday.  To hell with historical accuracy. What's required, but lacking, is the invocation of a butt-kicking right to continuously top itself. Artful decapitations, but a too-serious head on its shoulders.  I feel comfortable enough in my masculinity to say that if I had to stand in the presence of these men for more than ten seconds, I'd spontaneously grow a pair of ovaries.  Once the Spartans start cracking jokes while finishing off opponents with spears, 300 starts to wobble.  History is inconveniently complex. And so we get Frank Miller's version, in which everything is simplified to the point of porridge.  One of the casualties of all this digital-effects wizardry is a sense of emotional immediacy. There's a conspicuously remote quality to much of the movie that drains the film of the visceral energy it so desperately needs to make an impact.  The story is told with respectable adherence to the known facts, and presents a riveting and uniquely stylized portrait of a very bloody age.  Keeping in mind Slate's Mickey Kaus' Hitler Rule -- never compare anything to Hitler -- it isn't a stretch to imagine Adolf's boys at a 300 screening, heil-fiving each other throughout and then lining up to see it again.  Watching 300, there's the arresting sense of eavesdropping on another time.  It's impossible not to be moved by its nearly nonstop visual assault.  It's most definitely a Spartan movie, yet it's really all about wretched excess.  The stylized action, set to crunching guitar riffs, feels suffocating in its artificiality. Dialogue, taken mostly verbatim from Miller, comes cribbed from T-shirt slogans (real men wear crimson!) and Bruce Springsteen songs (no retreat, no surrender!).  It may not be by-the-book history -- a relative term in any event, when discussing the ancients whose worldview embraced men, gods and monsters -- but what a spectacle!  300 is just a silly, yet melodramatic, cliched, comic-book version of Gladiator with Frank Miller art direction.  Does the film stay faithful to the Miller and Varley's vision? Indeed it does -- to a kunch!  For once, the Larry King quote machines who supply the advance blurbs to the studio for their marketing campaigns will be correct.  The fascinating, fetishized battle scenes of 300 leave as many questions on the ground as drops of blood.  Snyder gives his movie the encompassing look and feel of a graphic novel. Perhaps because he shot the actors in front of digitally concocted backgrounds, Snyder is able to sustain an otherworldly quality that perfectly suits the movie's lurid material.  [Gerard Butler's character] charisma is elusive. He vigorously enunciates like a summer stock player doing Shakespeare. But the writing's overblown. And locating the requisite sorrow in this tale of heroism is an afterthought for Snyder and co.  It is excessively, cheerfully violent -- and it is gorgeous to behold. It looks like the world's most sophisticated and expensive video game, and I mean that in a good way.  Zack Snyder adapts Frank Miller's sparse graphic novel about the Battle of Thermopylae with the same devoted verve that Robert Rodriguez brought to Sin City.  The film's concerns, like those of Miller's book, are narrow: It wants only to submerge you in a sea of heroic brutality. It does just that one thing, but it does it with feverish expertise.  Coming soon to a football camp, police academy, military base, neocon assembly and jihadist cell near you: '300,' a motivational celebration of the 'no retreat, no surrender' ancient Spartans that disdains cut-and-run senators...  With filmmaking both epic and imaginative, 300 is the stuff that legends are made of.  Every complaint that's ever been made about comic books or comic book adaptations is accurate when applied to 300.  While the standard complaint might be about the surfeit of blood spilled, the real problem isn't so much the gore that gets splattered around in 300 as its lack of effect - it's all antiseptic and pretty.  '300' would have been a truly Olympian feat if it had characters that were as finely wrought as the images.  ...the movie suggests not only [Frank] Miller's graphic novel, but the equally compelling fantasy art of Frank Frazetta.  I'll be in the minority on this, but I just saw a film where 300 guys stood up to an army of thousands, so I'm feeling bold.  Ironically, the computer effects make it so clean, so ballet-like, so unrealistic. Battles should be chaotic and messy, not choreographed like an MGM musical.  Artistically triumphant in its arresting visual spectacle. Undoubtedly, the hyperactive male psyche for violent-induced petulance is proudly on display in the extravagant 300  I had two thoughts: (1) this looks really cool -- it's visually composed very well; and (2) it makes me think of a chain-combo from the video game God of War.  Marked by spectacularly excessive visuals, with warfare transformed into a beautiful ballet of blood.  While the overall look of the movie is quite dissimilar to Frank Miller's Sin City, it's still very much in line with his beautiful artwork. With the help of a heap of CGI, Snyder does an astonishing job of bringing a hyper-reality to believable fruition.  After a while, all of the excess, however glorious, just gets, well, excessive ... By the end, I didn't know which I wanted more: a cigarette, or, like, a whole bottle of aspirin.  It's got loads of action, stunning visuals and more testosterone than fraternity row. It's a spectacle to behold.  Every piercing, slashing and beheading is front and center forming the kind of orgiastic tango of bloodletting that would have Peckinpah offering Zack Snyder a cigar.  If you're the type who applauds decapitation, your hands are going to be raw from cheering while watching 300. This movie is about the decapitations, severed limbs and blood splattering all over the screen. Yet, it works.  So militaristic and single-minded that it's like a CGI-heavy blockbuster version of Triumph of the Will.  The heavily stylized compositions, balletic, blood-gushing violence, and wave after wave of different styles of marauders at times feel more like a video game than a movie.  far more original than I thought possible  300, even with its impressive vistas of computer-generated soldiers, is just a throwaway epic.  A giddily gory, supercharged comic book that is, for action-movie fans, one money shot after another.  both outrageously gory and gorgeous at the same time... the sort of movie in which one man solemnly tells another, 'I have filled my heart with hate,' and his friend immediately replies, 'Good!'  300 is about as subtle as a spear through the head. But it's also shamelessly entertaining, and not a bad way to make time move a little faster.  CGI fans are going to love 300, as will the fanboys who get a goodly dose of the gratuitous sex, nudity and ultra-violent combat that they hope for.  300 is about as violent as Apocalypto and twice as stupid.  It also pits millions of fans of brainless violence against a gallant band, or so I choose to think of us, who still expect movies to contain detectable traces of humanity.  Wholesale human slaughter never looked so pretty as in this heavily stylized rendering of the battle of Thermopylae in ancient Greece.  If forgiven some fan-boy pandering and homophobia, "300" is a magnificent spectacle and testament to heroic sacrifice in the name of freedom.  A mythic ode to righteous bellicosity. In at least one way, the film is true to the ethos of ancient Greece: It conflates moral excellence and physical beauty (which, in this movie, means being young, white, male, and fresh from the gyms of Brentwood).  The film is also quite action-heavy, which turns out to be its saving grace. The lengthy and rousing battle scenes are enough to outweigh most of the clunkier aspects ... sometimes just barely.  300 may be the Guy Movie to end all Guy Movies.  Snyder, needless to say, is completely on board with Miller's conception of Thermopylae as one- fifth history, four-fifths something that looks cool.  300 is one breathtaking digi-tableau after another. But the dialogue is a joke, the performances have more to do with bodybuilding than character, and the lesson that the film imparts isn't anything to do with courage and military skill.  Unless you like human shish kabob, don't spring forward. Fall back.  Snyder's 300 certainly has its share of the latest toys, but they make for a better coming-attractions trailer than a full-length theatrical film.  Just about everything in this pea-brained epic is overscaled and overwrought -- it's a cartoon trying to be a towering triptych. The dissonance between the film's heroic ambitions and its grindingly coarse treatment is rather amusing.  An assured visual stunner, full of sumptuous and grisly visions of an era past yet that still never existed.  The result is a delirious, turbo-charged roar of a movie that plays like Spartacus on bizarre drugs.  A big-screen adaptation of Men's Health and Fitness magazine, 300 is about as involving as sitting in front of a video game demo at Best Buy.  Neither history nor cinema is especially well served by 300, which is, nonetheless, a remarkable intersection of technology and imagination.  You couldn't say the script by Snyder, Kurt Johnstad and Michael Gordon is profound or historically true, but it provides a sturdy skeleton for the archetypal story and extraordinary special effects.  It's a fireworks show in the daytime, Christmas presents on December 26th, and porn without the penetration.  It is undeniably exciting and awe-inspiring; but it also lacks a sense of tactile warmth, a crucial core of reality.  There's a stale, synthetic airlessness about the movie. Imagine a large cast trapped in a series of spectacular screensavers. It could be ancient Greece. It could be somebody's hard drive.  In the end, 300's visual splendors don't give moviegoers anything to hang onto other than a batch of snappy images of extreme carnage.  It is too dumb as drama, even as war spectacle, to be transporting, frightening or sickening. Just numbing.  In creating the ultimate movie for sword-and-sandal blood-spatter fetishists, director Zack Snyder scores on the spectacle side -- 300 looks amazing -- but his mechanical story line and over-the-top melodramatics don't support the action.  Visually arresting and wildly cut together, 300 is (despite its well-earned R-rating) precisely the kind of movie that turns 14-year-old boys into ravenous movie geeks.  The disconnect between the human actors and the digital backgrounds is more pronounced here... Because classic Hollywood cinema is so rich with epic images of antiquity, this can't help but seem chintzy.  It's kind of a ghastly hoot, and while I suppose it does no harm, it also contributes nothing. It's a guilty unpleasantness.  The movie should've been called Ode to a Grecian Ab.  300 is at its best when it settles for purely visceral thrills.  It is a wall-to-wall canvas of expressionist ultraviolence.  Not since Mario Bava's Hercules in the Haunted World has Greco-Roman movie-house mythmaking been so thoroughly well-conceived and executed.  This long-winded macho man-athon becomes less of an epic tale of heroism than a contest for who can make his pecs the shiniest.  A full-blooded, testosterone-spiked shot glass that you down in one ferocious sitting.  The hilariously bombastic story about the ancient Battle of Thermopylae is very much like spending two hours watching someone play a video game.  Put bluntly, the movie's just too darned silly to withstand any ideological theorizing. And 'silly' is invoked here, more or less, with affection.  Call 300 the New Age sword-and-sandal epic -- a Hercules movie for the computer age.  Undeniably impressive on a visual level, the film is considerably more prosaic in terms of plotting and acting.  This is one of those ur-stories that actually feels like a slice of ancient wonder and grandeur...  There is so much slow motion that if they had run the entire film at normal speed, it would have been half as long.  Months before its release 300 already was revered by those who consider it a magnificent achievement for a live-action film to look exactly like a video game. Forgive me, but I don't see that as a reason to celebrate.  If anyone wanted to persuade vulnerable young minds to enter the maw of battle, 300 would make a heck of a recruitment video.  ...a perfect combination of moral wrongheadedness and inept filmmaking. On any level beyond the pictorial, Snyder makes clunky Cecil B. DeMille epics like The Ten Commandments look positively deft.  I honestly don't see how you can not like this movie. Go see this movie. You will not be disappointed.  300 blends bloody violence, sensuality, brutality, and moments of true beauty into an intoxicatingly unconventional film experience.  Nonstop action from beginning to end, 300 is a film that starts off in high gear and doesn't slow down.  Made me long for the days when epics were photographed with the beauty and clarity of Lawrence of Arabia, Ben-Hur and Spartacus.  I can't imagine another film coming out this year that will beat these 300 in the art department.  Director Zack Snyder is a visual genius - of that I'm sure - and 300 is very much a movie John Milius could love.  300 is a movie blood-drunk on its own artful excess. Guys of all ages and sexes won't be able to resist it.  Despite the fantastic visuals, action and sometimes rousing story, the needle flickers between grandiose and laughable -- in part because the film takes itself sooo relentlessly, slow-motion, music-swellin', see-you-in-hell seriously.  The battle sequences are filled with grotesque spectacle: They start off entertainingly ferocious, then grow numbing with stylized spraying blood and severed heads.  when it works, it is both ferocious and mesmerizing. Butler's performance is never less than visceral  </td>

      <th>3000 Miles to Graceland</th>
      <td> Extremely violent Elvis-based robbery for 17+ only.  The Tarantino effect is very much in evidence in this trashy, senseless, and excessively violent actioner about a casino heist that goes uproariously awry.  ...an incoherent jumble of images...  Russell and Costner deliver up some of the most amusing portrayals of their careers as casino-robbing Elvis impersonators  It's a shame the movie is ultimately so worthless, because the acting isn't half-bad  Like a needle jumping around on a scratchy old piece of vinyl, the movie skips aimlessly from raunchy comedy to blood-spattered thriller to gooey male-bonding drama without ever finding a groove to settle into.  Gleefully preposterous and at times blissfully inane.  You can't make stuff like this up.  Curse-a-my soul This movie couldn't be worse The prints should be delivered from the back of a Hearse  It insulted my intelligence, yes, but I still have some hope for the human race after watching it.  An exciting, action-packed heist sadly followed up by stupid con games and bad relationships.  While it does contain many action film clich&amp;eacute;s, it also has some quirky characters who give it some charm.  You WERE expecting helicopters, weren't you?  I felt like I was there for 3000 hours.  This is a terrible, horrible film, a big-budget student film with stupidity and insipidity written all over it. AOL Keyword: Suck.  [Director Demian Lichtenstein]'s as lazy and as generally incompetant as Ang Lee.  Wouldn't have a clue about human kindness or romantic passion if they launched up and bit it in the nose.  This is ineptly acted, edited, and directed. It's a tedious trip to nowhere.  Like a long road trip without a rest stop.  It is, in every conceivable instance, over-baked and under-conceived.  Lichtenstein grooves on bullets and blood and bedlam, but there's no grace, no drama, no sense of honor to the violence.  It's not funny, brutally violent, packed with despicable characters and utterly meaningless.  This latest example of violent amorality in contemporary movies is just too cluttered, disorganized and messy.  There is such a thing as too much. And 3KMTG is much too much.  The longer the film gets, the less sense it makes.  A grimy, ultra-violent, long and stupidly plotted Quentin Tarantino wanna-be.  Too amoral, and too bloody, and the ending would make John Woo blush, and it's so hip it's practically perverse about it. But it is kind of cool.  3000 Miles to Graceland shouldn't be reviewed in an arts section but rather in that portion of the newspaper dedicated to atrocities, environmental disasters and hate crimes.  Too much of the film is pure filler, visuals manipulated for onanistic purposes.  The picture feels longer than Presley's career and as irrelevant as he was by the end.  Fast-paced but dumb.  It should be banned from theaters on the grounds that anyone unwittingly seeing it is being subjected to cruel and unusual punishment.  Graceland is a slick exercise in cinema excess in which the audience is asked to pick their favourites from a gallery of low lives and hope they can elude the justice and punishment they actually deserve.  3000 Miles To Graceland would have worked if even one main character were attractive as a human being.  The film borrows lavishly from Oliver Stone's oeuvre, only it borrows the wrong things.  Suffers from a bloated length, a misogynistic spirit and a predominantly humorless tone.  If you have a perverse desire to see Kevin Costner in the full throes of a midlife crisis, then by all means go see 3000 Miles to Graceland.  With or without the ridiculous body count, this mindless movie is D.O.A. in a theater near you.  A sour and mean-spirited enterprise so desperate to please, it tries to be a yukky comedy and a hard-boiled action picture at the same time.  Starts out fast, dangerous, sexy, confident, funny with an edge. It ends up confused, bloated, unable to leave the stage when it should.  A catastrophic debacle of the highest order.  From its first jumpsuited Elvis to its last fireball, 3000 Miles to Graceland can be called meretricious, but not soporific.  Rather than giving Costner a chance to reinvent himself, all this movie really does is give him an opportunity to overact, while the rest of his co-stars -- including Kurt Russell -- stand around looking bored.  This is so relentlessly wrongheaded and downright ugly a movie that you want to call The Hague and demand an international tribunal be formed to investigate possible crimes against humanity.  The violence is brutal and, literally and figuratively, smacks of overkill.  Convoluted double crosses make this one more bloated than fat Elvis.  Fairly entertaining.  Goes through all the usual motions of a heist film -- heist, betrayal, chase, showdown -- and then, in case you missed them the first time, it goes through them again.  There are some plot holes that appear to have been set up to be resolved but just got left hanging when it was recut.  It's violence for the sake of violence, and completely devoid of style.  The smirking dialogue plays especially poorly in juxtaposition with the excessive violence.  An entertainingly heartless movie, made with style, energy and a modicum of humor.  What movie was this again? Oh, that's right, the new shoot-'em-up, 3000 Miles to Graceland. Hand me that checklist.  One of the bloodiest and mind-bogglingly dumb action-adventures since the heyday of Steven Seagal.  Elvis would write this one off as a jailhouse crock.  The problem for the viewer is finding a reason to give a hoot about any of these people.  This low-aiming actioner revels in cheap thrills and cheaper laughs that have already been fully exploited elsewhere.  With junk like this, only fools rush in.  For those fed up with Costner's frequent cornpone heroism (as worst exemplified in The Postman), this movie will prove a welcome antidote.  Nonsense from its first frame to its last, stupid beyond even the conventions of its genre, it begs the question of responsibility.  3000 Miles to Graceland revs up into oddly entertaining ride.  A film that takes a shot at redefining shameless for a new generation.  3000 Miles to Graceland never finds the appropriate balance of comedy and mayhem to rise above the pack.  3000 Miles to Graceland has the schizophrenic look and feel of something that has been stamped 'Return to Sender' on more than one occasion.  From the animated scorpion fight well before the credits end to final climactic firefight, this surprisingly riveting confection cannot help to bring a smile to one's face.  A witless action piece.  A high octane ride that starts to leak gas before it even gets going.  The artless carnage that bookends this glitzy, sometimes funny, heist flick mars what could have been a clever comedy.  Unremittingly vulgar, violent, vile and bitter.  One wannabe blockbuster that deserves to be lonesome tonight.  A bloody, tedious mess.  The funnest movie that I've seen so far this year!  The actors do what they can with a script that never should have made it across their agents' desks.  May look fun in the trailers, but it adds up to nothing more than a mound of rotting roadkill.  As flat as the Nevada desert where it is set.  A good ride.  How many ways can you show a police officer die?  Graceland even manages to make bad action films look good.  Utterly atrocious -- a long, tedious trip that leads absolutely nowhere.  Yet another mindless, derivative, headache- producing assortment of senseless brutality and unconvincing romance.  Remains an uneasy, uncomfortable balance between a comedic romp and something remarkably darker.  Lichtenstein apparently thought quirks such as the sight of Paul 'Having My Baby' Anka firing a rifle would be enough to keep a viewer entertained.  </td>

      <th>3:10 to Yuma</th>
      <td> Elevated above the usual fare by an engaging and complex relationship between its two stars, 3:10 To Yuma would be a thoroughly entertaining two hours whatever the genre - the Western setting is almost a bonus.  The real thrill of the film lies in watching these two men, sat on various sides of the moral fence, gradually converge and respect each other.  3:10 to Yuma is as heavy on character as it sounds like it should be ... and still a rip-roaring adventure around it; until it all gets away from director James Mangold in a crashing heap of unlikely motivation and flawed decisions.  Director James Mangold amps up the blood and thunder without sacrificing the moral complexity of Elmore Leonard's original short story.  3:10 to Yuma confirms that the western is alive and kicking with a vengeance.  It is part of the richness of 3.10 to Yuma that this is a classical piece of storytelling with themes and characters that can be found in the very earliest Westerns.  Bale and Crowe are superlative, but Mangold's rote, banal expansion never quickens the pulse.  Mangold's direction is effective, if unobtrusive, and the dusty deserts of the American west continue to provide a cinematic palette that fails to run dry.  Gives "solid craftsmanship" a dreary name  Pays homage to the classic Western by staying true to genre conventions, but does so with a fresh set of eyes that gives the film a welcome place in a modern multiplex.  Fifty years have elapsed since 3:10 to Yuma last pulled into the station, but, man, the return trip is worth the wait.  vi%u0161e nego solidan primjer vitalnog %u017Eanra kojemu su toliko puta, a sre%u0107om pogre%u0161no, predvi%u0111ali smrt  First 1.5 hours are slow, preposterously scripted, and short of powerful dialogue. I liked the ending though.  3:10 to Yuma is a big, brawling action-adventure with strong psychological elements. The original 3:10 to Yuma, with Glenn Ford and Van Heflin, directed by Delmer Daves, was a psychological western, and the present version expands on that.  In the end, what makes 3:10 to Yuma work despite a rather preposterous final act, is that it refuses to see anything in terms of moral simplicity, despite the presence of black and white hats.  Nothing terribly original happens in this remake of a 1957 semi-classic that starred Glenn Ford and Van Heflin, but everything happens smoothly and with grace.  It's not too often that a remake holds up to the original, but Mangold's rendition blows the 1957 version out of the water in every imaginable way possible.  A mini-epic on the historical changes of the old west...serving as a just tribute to earlier, classic westerns such as The Searchers and, more recently, Unforgiven.  [I]f you're looking for an Unforgiven-style reinvention of the Western, prepare for disappointment.  I was surprised at how engaged I remained throughout almost the entire movie, and much of that credit might have to go to the film's dual leads, Christian Bale and Russell Crowe...  The western has been buried and revived so many times in recent years that it's beginning to resemble one of George Romero's stale zombies...  One of the year's most enjoyable films.  Christian Bale had me in the first few seconds when he started limping toward the window  Uneven yet entertaining...  3:10 to Yuma is riveting, exciting and rare %u2014 a thinking person's Western.  Nao sei se o cineasta pretendia homenagear um de seus filmes favoritos ao empalidece-lo, mas, para o bem ou para o mal, foi isto que acabou fazendo.  Cinematic and wonderful on the big screen, this magnificent remake revisits the grandeur of the western, tossing around elements of morality in the melee of good pitted against evil... Russell Crowe is splendid.  The film is a creditable remake - no better than the original but different enough to stand on its considerable merits.  If 3:10 to Yuma can't resuscitate the western, nothing will.  Having the chutzpah to make a straightforward, unself-aware oater feels downright revolutionary. Whether that's enough to justify this enterprise, however, is debatable.  [Mangold's] examination of the moral complexities of his two main characters makes this an intriguingly timely as well as timeless story.  Mangold's film is more than sufficiently subtexty and cynical for our modern sensibilities while simultaneously embracing Mangold's obvious pleasure in the Westerns' time-honored swinging saloon doors and stern masculine traditions.  Christian Bale is having a standout year, it started with his amazing work in Rescue Dawn and quickly followed up with this.  A contender for one of my favorites of 2007, and damn near superior to its predecessor...  Remains an evocative morality tale about what makes men good, what makes them bad and what makes them ugly.  Crowe and Bale captivate in Western remake.  Russell Crowe plays his role as Ethan Edwards for the post 9/11 western.  Westerns may be old fashioned, but as old-school homages go, superb writing and compelling acting will never go out of style.  There's no true grit to be found in James Mangold's fun but safe Western remake. Nitpicking, however, is no way to treat a movie that gives us two heavyweights like Russell Crowe and Christian Bale on top of their games.  As well-done as the set pieces are, giving the film its more substantive dramatic kick is the psychological warfare.  The film is sharply written, although you must take a monumental leap of faith to buy into the ending that unfolds.  The new "3:10 To Yuma" is an excellent horse opera. Catch it before it leaves town.  Russell Crowe and Christian Bale make terrific foes in this classic western tale.  [Mangold] builds tension not only in the mano-a-mano scenes between Bale and Crowe, but also when throwing in a wild card, such as Mol's gentle Alice.  This is a fine, handsomely staged movie, as exciting and stimulating as anything I've seen this year.  As played by Bale, Evans' intensity is allowed to slowly burn through his quiet facade, until the man he once was returns.  Shooting a western in this day and age would be either brilliant because it hasn't been done in so long or Hollywood suicide. It turned out to be bit of both.  Mangold delivers a taut modern take on a lesser classic, preserving the High Noon themes about doing the right thing against all odds, and injecting a more modern pacing and urgency without going overboard.  Yuma portrays a West that is stark, barren, and morally ambiguous. Like all the great "revisionist westerns" of recent years, very few characters are all good or all bad.  Boasting a taut script, precise mise-en-scene, and stellear acting from Russell Crowe and Chistian Bale, this oater immediately posits itself as an A-Level Western, much more than an honorable remake of the 1957 film. Will it revive the genre?  3:10 submits that the American West is a function of capitalism, expedience and exploitation of resources. That's not to say morality isn't a useful measure, it's just relative.  It honors both the genre and the original film without doing harm to either while containing enough of its own virtues to allow it to stand alone as its own entity.  The close confines of cinematographer Phedon Papamichael's camera, coupled with brilliant dialogue delivered by great actors on top of their game, allow us to overlook the letdown of a finale.  The studiousness, or maybe affectation, that has informed Mangold's visual style has now been applied to the reproduction of classic Western moviemaking.  3:10 to Yuma is that rarity -- an action Western pushed into overdrive by its complicated, savvy characters.  An attention-holding ride through rough country of both the physical and spiritual kind.  There's no point in wondering whether 3:10 to Yuma will trigger another revival of the genre. But for two exciting hours, the picture brings it fully alive once again.  A well-made movie that isn't as simply expressed as its predecessor and so loses some of its mythic quality; the more you complicate westerns the less effective they often become.  A shame that it ends on this one false note, but up to that point 3.10 To Yuma fairly races along.  ...Crowe and Bale are first-rate, the action satisfying.  New Zealand's Russell Crowe and Britain's Christian Bale, donning the hats and accents to play outlaw and escort with grizzled assurance.  A terrific turn by Peter Fonda, as a leathery bounty hunter hell-bent on retribution, is a bonus in a film far livelier than anyone had a right to expect.  A great anti-buddy movie.  Despite a faintly anti-climactic ending, there's plenty of entertainment in this robust, old-fashioned western tale.  An entertaining but generally underwhelming effort that squanders the talents of a great cast and comes with one of the daftest endings in years.  A remake of a 1957 movie starring Glenn Ford, Yuma's pacing may owe something to the contemporary action movie, but the themes are age-old: redemption, morality and the lure of the lawless wilderness and of the killers who call it home.  In 1957, the climax looked like Hollywood wish-fulfilment. Fifty years later, it still does.  Revolving around two very different but equally impressive performances from its leads, James Mangold's remake is everything you want from a western: stunning vistas, gripping shoot-outs and a morally complex core that is compelling to the end.  Pitting Chris against Russ, Yuma harks back to B-movie westerns but fails to tap its A-list stars' potential. Those who aren't diehard fans of the genre might want to catch a different train.  They don't make them like that anymore. But, hang on, they just did!  The two leads' sparking byplay, Crowe's addled cockiness versus Bale's nervy grit, would grace any surroundings, but it's a pleasure to revisit the frontier in a drama which feels far more vital than mere nostalgic homage.  3:10 to Yuma builds up a full head of steam and sustains it.  Yet another stirring example that The Western is still very much alive and kicking.  Engaging, well made Western with exciting action sequences, a thought-provoking script and terrific performances from Bale and Crowe.  This film combines action and character, adding in realism that the previous version did not have.  Here we have, for the first time in years, an unabashed all-American Western.  Welcome back Western, nice to see you back on top again.  ... let it be said loud and clear: In almost every respect, Mangold's new version is superior to the original.  Not just one of this year's best films, but also one my favorite westerns ever...What an entertaining, thoughtful, relevant film this is.  A terrific movie with excellent performances from Crowe and Bale. If it doesn't find itself on the short list of Academy Award contenders, the film itself has been robbed.  Just as few people get the opportunity to exhibit intestinal fortitude when it really matters, few movies are as stirring as this remake.  The effort to complicate their interaction even further, however, risks implausibility in the final moments -- an unfortunate consequence of the very fine work that has gone before.  At the helm of this remake, James Mangold initially risks stalling the plot with too much backstory, but then it's edge-of-your-seat action all the way.  James Mangold's expert and entertaining 3:10 to Yuma demonstrates both the Western's age-old appeal, and the problems it presents to a contemporary filmmaker.  A decent Western, attractive mainly because of the acting duel between the straight-shooting Bale and the untamed Crowe.  The editing is tense and there's mucho splatter but the climax is unforgivable for reasons I can't spell out -- and owes something to a recent picture I can't name.  A complicated cowboy flick where you're conflicted about whether to root for the guys in the white hats or the black hats by the time the big showdown arrives.  Great cinematography takes more than plopping a camera down in a desert canyon ... though it helps. It takes John Wayne framed by a doorway. Gary Cooper's walk. Clint Eastwood's squint. Gene Hackman's grin. And, now, Russell Crowe's eyes.  For my money happiness is a good western.  Breathtakingly exciting and incredibly moving, this -- far and away James Mangold's finest work -- is nothing less than a revolution. It makes the old not so much new but real again, vital and relevant.  Bears many of the same fatalistic concerns as its 1957 predecessor, but its totally slick execution... polishes the feeling right out of them.  Il aura fallut attendre jusqu'en septembre pour le premier tres grand film de 2007  If you are making a do over, at least correct the original's faults.  Not quite on par with the 1957 version, perhaps, but certainly acting as a proper update instead of just a lazy rehash.  Kudos to director James Mangold for not letting anything stand in the way of splendid performances in this impressive remake.  Crowe and Bale deliver exactly as you'd expect. The actors are perfectly cast in their respective roles.  Crowe and Bale are a great study in contrasts, yet the two characters develop a grudging respect for each other that enriches the murky morality play that makes up the last half hour.  An extremely well made, spectacularly entertaining Western that represents director James Mangold's strongest film to date.  Mangold is a filmmaker who doesn't mind throwing a melancholic spotlight on the swallowed regret and pained reflection of his protagonists.  Sprawling, intriguing and handsomely shot, Yuma builds its gruff tension while being reminiscent of the frothy frontier flicks from yesteryear.  Exciting, looks great, and even with the heavy emphasis on gunplay and action, it's well acted, especially by Christian Bale.  A Western that could only occur in Gower Gulch, but the acting of Bale and Crowe and Foster makes it worthwhile.  The new 3:10 to Yuma fires about 5,000 more rounds than the dull earlier edition did.  The movie feels like an uneasy combination of new and old western stylings.  3:10 to Yuma is a drama well worth the journey.  Director James Mangold, who hit his stride with the Johnny Cash biopic Walk The Line, delivers another solid punch with this hard-edged and marvelously acted remake of Delmar Daves' classic 1957 western.  James Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma, an old-school Western updated for modern mores and tastes, pays due homage to its 1957 predecessor.  When a movie is as entertaining as this one, you begin to think this formerly beloved genre is due for a revival.  [Director] Mangold succeeds on his own terms, largely because the actors he's working with here, Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, so comfortably inhabit the movie, and the genre that cradles it.  You don't need to be a fan of that near-extinct genre to enjoy the movie -- sold more as a faceoff between Alpha males Russell "Gladiator" Crowe and Christian "Batman" Bale -- but it may turn you into one.  This Yuma is Shane with a train.  In 3:10 to Yuma director James Mangold has made himself a grand Western.  3:10 to Yuma offers plenty of guns-blazing, pulse-pounding action, but it's the excellent lead performances that stay with you.  A terrific, old-fashioned western, proof positive that sometimes, they do "make 'em like they used to."  It's a movie grounded in something like the credible realism of a John Ford Western but which also can appease the thirsts for blood, wit and tension harbored by fans of Quentin Tarantino.  An extremely well-acted and well-directed remake of a 1957 oater based on a short story by the then-obscure Elmore Leonard.  Even with its flaws, it's a dusty horse ride that's well worth taking and more proof that the western never dies.  ... gritty, hugely entertaining.  If the original overplayed its naivete, the update of 3:10 to Yuma overplays its cynicism only to sell it out at the end.  The heart-stopping, breathtaking journey of 3:10 to Yuma reminds us just how exciting a good, old-fashioned movie can be.  [Director] Mangold has brought welcome intensity to the project, giving 3:10 to Yuma a visceral, immediate quality that makes it realistic and mythic all at the same time.  Reminded me of what a rare pleasure it has become to watch a straightforward and convincing adult genre film...  3:10 to Yuma started out as a pretty straightforward tale. But so much stuff has piled onto this simple structure that you can hear it creaking.  Unapologetically harsh and heedlessly entertaining despite its imperfections, the film includes two masterful performances from Crowe and Bale - actors so intense, they could wear red and intimidate a charging bull.  Represents the classic western genre with a deft touch that recalls what made those movies so enjoyable in the first place.  The best Western since Unforgiven, 3:10 to Yuma is both cathartic and intelligent. While a wildly eventful action-adventure and outlaw shoot-'em-up, it's also a vibrant story of heroism, villainy and hard-earned redemption.  3:10 to Yuma takes too long to decide what kind of movie it's going to be.  It's got old-timey atmosphere with just enough new-age empathy to work. Throw in plenty of gun fighting and two fine actors circling one another with glee, and you've got one hot pistol of a movie.  It remains, underneath all the decoration and heavy artillery, a good yarn.  The tale never quite resonates beyond the screen.  3:10 to Yuma manages to incorporate the rhythms of a contemporary action movie while maintaining a healthy respect for the tenets of the genre. That makes it a train well worth catching.  James Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma restores the wounded heart of the Western and rescues it from the morass of pointless violence.  Director James Mangold draws good performances from both leads as they wrestle with the predatory power structure of the old west.  Lean, almost absurdly satisfying.  3:10 to Yuma struts like a show horse and kicks like a mule.  James Mangold probably won't like me calling his latest film a solid formula movie, but that's what 3:10 to Yuma is.  Great action, sets and camera work set this traditional western up for success in spite of stereotypical good guys and bad guys  Big screen entertainment that rides right next to the great ones, a blazing action-packed film that reminds you what first-rate storytelling and filmmaking is all about.  What Mangold had crafted is like a classic western in theme, but it resembles a modern movie in its pace and its complicated, multi-layered characterizations.  A kick-ass action film, as well as a vastly entertaining movie that proves that popcorn flicks don't have to be dumb, shallow or contemporary to be enjoyed.  These are two top-notch actors - one British, one Australian - who are utterly at home in this most American of genres.  Follows closely in the original's footsteps, except for all the business about honor, recovered self-worth and justice&amp;#8230; There's no spiritual duel, no earned respect and debt of honor&amp;#8230; just a broken man and a capricious one.  Russell Crowe and Christian Bale are the main reasons to see 3:10 to Yuma, a serviceable addition to the current western revival.  The lean, cerebral swagger of the 1957 western 3:10 to Yuma is stretched out and punched up with more characters, gun-shooting and horse-riding in an entertaining remake directed by James Mangold.  3:10 to Yuma has its off moments, and its unexplored potential, but for the vast majority of its running time, this is an excellently made and superbly acted throwback.  It's a remake that takes the original's premise and opens it up in a way that feels right. It's smart and solid and unflinching, especially about violence.  Scarily implies that the bad guys now were playing along all along.  A rip-roarin' Western with thrilling gunfights to match its moral tug-of-war, and both Bale and Crowe are terrific.  An edge-of-your-seat thriller with incredible performances by Bale, Foster and Crowe.  A very disappointing western snoozer ... it's like Mangold's lethargic Cop Land.  [G]loriously old-fashioned in the best movie way, redolent of its pulpy, junky roots in the pure adventure thrills of dime novels but also heady with consequence...  Moves at a steady pace, focuses on its characters' shifts in personal morale, and features fine performances, especially from its leads.  Wade's voice sounds like far-off thunder wrapped in velvet; Evans' every word is marked by exhaustion and edginess. ...These men have real complexity, and so do the actors assigned to play them.  Yuma is a 10 in my book, a welcome entry into the pantheon of classic westerns and a bona fide masterpiece of cinema.  I encourage those that go to see the new 3:10 to Yuma to seek out the original on cable/satellite TV or on DVD rental (it is available). Although both tell the same story, each is done with its own sense of style.  Helps us remember why we loved westerns in the first place.  In attempting to moralize the filth of the old West, Mangold sells out the genre's strongest asset.  The ending is totally unsatisfactory. Without giving away any spoilers, ... the resolution is unnecessary and much more cynical than the original.  Crowe is a perfect rogue showing us Wade's mean and nasty side, along with some charm and intelligence  The story is no bigger in the new version, which goes on for 117 minutes. And it's certainly not better.  It combines Old West values with modern filmmaking sensibilities, and it never fails to be compelling, right down to the tense, harrowing finale.  3:10 to Yuma actually improves upon its source by adding more grit and lifeblood.  Superb.  If you don't know that first and infinitely better movie, you likely will find this an OK but instantly forgettable retro-Western, with few dull moments, carried by Crowe's charisma in his role of sly bandit king.  One of the great pleasures of westerns is the showcase they offer for character actors, and 3:10 to Yuma has a pair of aces.  [Director James] Mangold has been smart or fortunate in casting, and personalities sustain interest even when the narrative flags.  May not shake all the cowbells off the genre, but it kicks up plenty of dust.  Yields performances as elemental as the landscape while it questions a culture more concerned with money than human life.  There is nothing overwhelmingly bad about the finished product, but there is also nothing, save for a performance or two, that inspires the viewer to sit up and take notice.  Under Mangold's sure if uninspired hand, the new Yuma is reasonably exciting and terse, and, like its predecessor, built around a memorable villain of ambiguous villainy.  This tense character piece offers proof that Hollywood can still make a good, traditional Western, rather than emulating the revisionist Westerns that have followed in the wake of Clint Eastwood's 1993 Academy Award-winner Unforgiven.  What Alfred Hitchcock once said about thrillers also applies to Westerns: The stronger the bad guy, the better the film. By that measure, 3:10 to Yuma is excellent.  A period-perfect, witty, well-played and exciting Western is all but ruined in the final minutes by someone the screenwriters, a star who insisted on image-flattering changes, a director feeling his Walk the Line oats.  Those who have a deeper abiding love for the western genre than I, may love the new Yuma. I liked a good deal of it -- just enough to be frustrated by the clutter.  The presence of two great actors already puts a few points in the win column, and 3:10 to Yuma rolls along efficiently like a wagon with finely tuned wheels.  Apart from the final minutes of the film that strike its only false note, 3:10 to Yuma barrels down the track at full force.  Moves like a barn on fire.  All too often the action will become a bewildering blur of staging rather than an enthralling construct of violence, increasing the already nagging chorus of logic gaps that do their best to undermine the film.  It's way too early to signal the rebirth of the western at the movies, but if it happens, it'll be because of smart and thoughtful entertainment like this that sucks audiences in whether or not they care how the West was won.  How would today's actors look in the sort of hats once worn by James Stewart, Alan Ladd and John Wayne? If Crowe and Bale are any indication, pretty good.  Crowe adopts a stance of detached bemusement, his eyes alight at what he's watching, almost as if he's decided to play along with his adversary's dogged persistence... just to see where they'll end up.  3:10 to Yuma is a complex, captivating film that allows the audience to draw its own conclusions.  a masterpiece of psychological drama coupled with a darn fine action flick that uses the classic western as its idiom. And then turns it on its head.  It's respectful of its predecessor, and when it does make changes to the existing template, they aren't preposterous or pandering -- rather, they merely take another logical path than the one employed in the previous version.  The performances of Mr. Crowe and Mr. Bale alone are worth the price of admission.  3:10 to Yuma rehashes western motifs -- those civilization/wilderness, essence of manhood themes -- but builds up to a poorly plotted, shoddily executed gun battle.  If 3:10 to Yuma can't generate life into that most moribund of genres, the western, then it's probably time to consign the idea to Boot Hill and be done with it.  A wonderfully old-fashioned western that works in contemporary terms--a rousing demonstration that people can make the kinds of pictures they supposedly don't make anymore.  Maybe this redo didn't need so many bells and whistles, but Mangold brings it home.  three great performances that will satisfy you even if you don't like cowboy flicks.  It's a wonderful surprise to discover that this new version, starring Russell Crowe and Christian Bale and directed by James Mangold, not only remains true to its roots but expands on them in ways that are thrilling and thoroughly entertaining.  A very middle of the road film, one that will never get your heart racing or piss you off too much.  Mangold's remake of 3:10 to Yuma isn't as startling a resurrection job as his Johnny Cash biopic, but it does send a saddlebag full of western tropes skittering into the 21st century.  Decent-enough entertainment, though it's hardly going to breathe new life to a genre whose demise has been reported for at least 30 years.  About the best you can say about Mangold's work is that it won't kill off the genre. Nor will it help to revive it.  Russell Crowe and Christian Bale are two of the finest actors of their generation, and their talents are put to great use.  The atmosphere pointedly caters to the male ego and the dark deliciousness inherent in its complexities.  Watching a movie like this, I can't help but wish that the Western would come back into favor again. We can use more productions like this.  3:10 to Yuma's sanitized view is flatly middlebrow - even the line readings are delivered to make convenient actor showcase clips on award shows.  Who says the Western is dead?  </td>

      <td> Spike Lee has launched another perfectly timed counteroffensive: a calmly wrenching mix of oral history and period newsreels.  It's presented with Lee's usual intelligence and clarity as he skilfully mixes politics with moving reminders of the lives it affects.  Time and tragedy may have flattened the four girls into remote paragons of youthful virtue, but the viciousness of anti-integrationist rhetoric is palpable and should never be forgotten.  There isn't an ounce of flab or hype, and the story it tells is profoundly affecting.  A compelling, straightforward account of a deeply sorrowful and pivotal event in the civil rights movement.  Lee's filmmaking ... has the beauty of simplicity and the shadings of compassion.  Spike Lee's Oscar-nominated documentary, about one of the defining moments of the civil rights movement, balances personal and painful memories of many witnesses with a poignantly political expose of the event, the murder of four innocent girls.  The big part of Lee's film commemorates the lives of the '4 little girls' who died, through the memories of parents, siblings and friends.  Some of the credit for the two convictions may well be due to Spike Lee's memorable 1997 documentary...which brought new attention to the case.  Immensely gripping in its outrage and poignancy. Nobody knows how to bring the disdain of racial to the forefront like the skilled Spike Lee  a clear example that film auteurs can handle a variety of genres when inspired  A powerful tale of tragic loss turned into positive action.  The movie is strongest when Lee keeps his eye on the prize: the experiences of ordinary people in an extraordinary time.  4 Little Girls brilliantly captures a moment in American history and tells an achingly painful story of injustice and family loss.  Lee's powerful film works best in the stock footage from the past for no words can adequately describe what happened then.  There is mostly sadness and regret at the surface in 4 Little Girls, but there is anger in the depths, as there should be.  It is Lee's job as a film maker to imbue these images with life, and that's a task he easily accomplishes.  A thoughtful, graceful, quietly devastating account.  </td>

      <th>40 Days and 40 Nights</th>
      <td> Translates your average bad teen comedy into a below-average adult romantic comedy.  Mildly amusing Josh Hartnett sex comedy.  Lehmann and screenwriter Rob Perez milk this idea for everything it's worth.  This tedious romantic romp is based on a single idea--a hunk (Josh Hartnet) abstaining from sex for the duration of Lent--extended to the limits of a feature-length picture.  Even by the relatively relaxed standards of teen sex, or no sex, farces, 40 Days and 40 Nights is painful to watch.  They could have easily made yet another gross-out comedy, but instead the laughs are born of clever writing and likable characters.  Finds a way to present a light-hearted sexual comic fairy tale, then derails itself with bad romantic comedy fallbacks.  This movie was about the most excruciating hour and a half I've endured recently.  A reasonably intelligent adult comedy.  This film would've been a lot funnier if the filmmaker's had shown the slightest bit of imagination in terms of the plot's comic possibilities.  It's a collection of guy humor, no more and no less.  In places 40 Days is actually quite witty but one can't help feeling that both Hartnett and Lehmann ... deserve better than this.  Mean-spirited, ugly little movie.  The movie reminded me of a beer commercial during a football game, with about as much depth but not nearly the wit.  One half is a characteristic sex farce, the other a surprisingly genuine and amiable romance.  Hartnett's pitch-perfect sexual panic can be hilariously funny.  A sex comedy starring Josh Hartnett is almost guaranteed a mainstream following. But that hasn't kept Lehmann from giving 40 Days the look and feel of a spirited, independent comedy.  A slight but enjoyable-in-the-moment cataloging of one guy's battle with libido... [that] never manages -- or, sadly, seems to aspire -- to anything more than breezy diversion.  Hartnett and Sossamon resonate a natural chemistry that infuses this mixed affair with uncommon humanism and sex appeal.  Given its drastically contrived nature, the script gets further than I expected.  You may feel like taking a vow of abstinence yourself -- at least from Hollywood youth-sex comedies.  This is a movie that longs to be naughty, but never knows how to go far enough to truly surprise.  'An admittedly raunchy but smart satirical poke at sexual politics in the information age. It's also funnier than we have any right to expect.'  The script boils down to 90 minutes of dirty jokes. Most of them are funny and some are hilarious.  Hartnett may grow into a major film star someday with better material, but this is a one-night stand he'll want to forget.  So wildly incoherent in tone, ambition and character motivation that it's hard to believe it was ever written out in longhand from start to finish.  This is a movie full of sex jokes, but they don't involve mechanics and fluids so much as the nature of sex and the way it governs young life.  Robert Perez's screenplay takes largely predictable roads, most of them leading straight to Jigglesville, with detours along the way to Viagra Falls and Bulgeburg.  Raunchy dialogue and sexually explicit sequences overshadow the film's slight hint that factors other than sex might also be important in human relationships.  Then, there's the seen-that-before scene of poor Matt walking around with a protrusion he seems blithely unaware of that seems to go to some preposterously immense proportions.  None of the characters interested me.  A dulling experience. The movie screams been there, done that and offers nothing new to the table.  Why do screenwriters demean women in these movies by having them find these lunk-headed doofuses so attractive?  Not the funniest film ever on this subject, but a nice statement and satire on relationships today.  ... a ridiculously lame film that has absolutely nothing to say about real life or love.  Nothing more than a lame vehicle for teen heartthrob Josh Hartnett.  A parody on sexual preoccupation in a pastel-colored unreality.  it is essentially a slightly more mature gross-out comedy  The premise is groan-inducing, the execution doubly so.  The material may be lightweight, but it's been shaped into a film that deserves to become a classic in an admittedly lightweight genre.  A funny sex comedy about not having sex.  It has a way of wearing out what's supposed to be knockabout farce.  Squeamishly risque teen sexcom.  For all its outrageous humor, 40 Days and 40 Nights actually has something to say about the value of emotional intimacy over physical intimacy.  Josh Hartnett is good and I love Shannyn Sossamon I think she could become a big star, but this comedy is so wrong on so many levels.  Creates a rapport with its young viewers by first affronting them with its crude treatment of sex and then entertaining them with a silly plot.  It won't take 40 days and 40 nights to forget this turkey.  plays like a teen sex comedy filtered through the relative sophistication of urban twentysomething hi-tech workers  Two previously boring actors [Hartnett and Sossamon] ... bring their characters to sparkly life.  The penis jokes become increasingly tedious.  Events proceed on a thoroughly predictable course in Robert Perez's formulaic screenplay.  Immature, predictable, and annoying.  An entertaining sex farce.  What I learned from this movie: Absitenence can be a very good thing. Especially from box offices where this film is playing.  It comes dangerously close to being America's first sex comedy without comedy.  Director Michael Lehmann cannot decide whether he is making a lewd and manic farce or a lovey-dovey romance.  A smart sex comedy that revels more in the gray matter than the groin.  It's not Shakespeare's Twelfth Night or anything, but it's pretty darned good!  The movie is both exhilarating and depressing. The trouble is, I can't figure out which is more important.  A smart and witty romantic farce that mixes sweet and sexy with surprising aplomb.  It does nothing to challenge the self-centredness of the smug little world it depicts, and everything to endorse it.  less than I had hoped for...but just about what I had expected.  Maybe you'll work up more sympathy than I did for this great-looking kid who encounters no difficulty whatsoever seducing any female he desires.  A fluffy, dopey, but occasionally likable romantic comedy.  Wears out its welcome and ability to milk its premise long before its runtime is done.  The slapdash and vulgar second half ... saps the good will engendered by some funny gags and heartthrob Josh Hartnett's ... heart-tuggingly earnest performance.  The laughs are sitcom shaped.  It's too mild to be crass; it's clumsy.  It's the filmic equivalent of the young men it represents -- guys who think, talk and brag about sex without ever really getting any.  The first movie since Chasing Amy to successfully balance gentle romance and raunchy comedy.  Skitters between cheap, raunchy jokes, earnest homilies about abstinence and truthfulness, overheated visuals and underbaked plotting.  The underpinning misogyny of 40 Days and 40 Nights is only exceeded by its cynicism.  Eyeball-gougingly awful.  Highly flawed but crudely funny.  The way Matt's fate plays out is consistently engaging, at once clever and insightful.  Runs out of ideas long before it runs out of celluloid.  Frivolous entertainment which only works because of Hartnett.  Over and above the charmless subject matter, the movie is ferociously badly made and edited.  A base guy flick that's clueless about women, relationships and emotion, and even flirts with sacrilege.  Without the defence of teen ignorance, 40 Days is little more than soft-core sleaze.  An American Pie variation without the affection for its characters or original humor.  Unrelenting in the number of ways it can get its one joke wrong.  A lighthearted romp that delivers laughs, and a thought or two, along the way.  The details are fresh and writer Rob Perez's dialogue about sex has more complexity and nuance than we expect.  The movie's as sexist as can be.  Part romance, part raunch, 40 Days and 40 Nights has difficulty sticking to a consistent tone.  A one-joke sex comedy that seems to go on about 38 days and 38 nights too long.  Works as guilty pleasure; there are plenty of great laughs which sustain the film despite its faults.  Hartnett's charm and his simmering chemistry with Sossamon ... trumps most of the film's silly and occasionally stupid excesses.  A cheap movie, false and phony, that thinks it's about moving beyond cheapness and phoniness.  With a cast this attractive and this darn likable, you sort of wish 40 Days and 40 Nights wasn't quite as dirty-minded and sex-obsessed as it is.  The material ... is much like its protagonist -- single-tracked and badly in need of a cold shower.  This is a very raunchy and explicit comedy but it is all done with sweetness and even a certain humility that keeps it from being too disgusting.  It's dangerous stuff that shouldn't be dismissed lightly.  It's just a shame that someone wasted their fluids creating a number of the people responsible for this absolute mess.  Mostly fun to watch, buoyed by some strong dialogue and performances by the supporting cast.  Coarse, misogynistic and blasphemous.  Mildly amusing but wholly unnecessary.  If short on surprises, the screenplay has a fair share of snappy patter.  Although not without its share of laughs, 40 Days is almost pornographic.  A young man vows to give up sex for Lent. Why? Because he's in a Miramax comedy that requires an immediately graspable premise.  Screenwriter Rob Perez knows as much about both self-discipline and Catholicism as I know about echocardiography.  A truly wretched sex comedy, or should we say non-sex comedy.  A remarkably sniggering, tawdry sex comedy...so gross and smutty that perhaps a trenchcoat should be required apparel for every audience member.  Shows that smutty and adorable don't mix.  The joke is yanked, inflated, stretched and strung out over the film's 93 minutes.  Merely another work for hire in the canon of director Michael Lehmann.  Even [Hartnett] can't overcome the lameness of the movie's increasingly obvious attempts to make horniness seem funny.  Pushes the envelope in the same goodhearted way the first "American Pie" did, relying on a pitch-perfect cast of characters to deliver some memorable one-liners.  There's certainly a place for lightweight-yet-entertaining romantic piffle, and 40 Days and 40 Nights most assuredly qualifies as that.  It's risque, lewd, worthy of Balzac, 90-plus minutes of pretty hilarious smut.  A fairly perfunctory sex comedy, which is too bad because the premise is amusing.  Essentially as meaty as a Saturday Night Live skit-turned-feature film but is also mercifully short and pretty well-paced.  Along with its share of cheap comedy, it delivers a decent love story, perceptive comment on sexuality and relationships, and a breakout performance by Josh Hartnett.  Just a kinder, gentler teensploitation comedy, but Hartnett's Matt, at least, invites the audience to graduate to something better.  40 Days and 40 Nights is raunchy, and graphic, and sometimes even funny, but its attitude makes it a difficult film to enjoy.  ...delightfully surprising freshness and soul where all the hackneyed conventions usually are.  Lehmann, far from the glory days of Heathers, has made a movie about a hard-on, in which he relentlessly pounds a flaccid premise.  Compared to most of the youth oriented fare released over the last few months, "40 Days and 40 Nights" shines  Sex is the star here, and she shines.  This is as stupid as movies come.  Probably would have succeeded if it hadn't been for the casting of the leads, Josh Hartnett and Shannyn Sossamon, two beautiful but bland actors.  Contains some smart writing, funny dialogue, a cheeky production design, attractive leading actors and only occasional lapses into tastelessness.  Proves that a comedy based on sex need not be ham-fisted to be effective.  The misunderstandings are all thankfully low on the "Three's Company" scale while Hartnett and Sossamon's chemistry is undeniably potent.  </td>

      <th>50 First Dates</th>
      <td> ...has an unexpected emotional undertow and enough hard-won laughs to make it succeed.  A surprisingly good film with a sweet story, top-notch acting, and an ending that will really hit your heart strings.  Within the witlessness and crudeness is a touching (or mawkish, depending on your perspective) romantic comedy trying to get out.  The moments that Sandler and Barrymore can steal together are golden.  Though the set-up in this light romantic comedy is a bit strained, once you get into the main interaction with the two stars you get both the laughs and the emotion that you hope for in a film like this.  Gossamer thin, but lots of fun nevertheless.  Quite what age group this soft-centered entertainment is aimed at is hard to divine.  I had hard time believing that someone as shallow as Henry would all of the sudden drop everything in his life for this girl, but the film is surprisingly winning.  This dopey film has virtually nothing going for it but its genial stars.  Click to read review  It's nearly a profound concept, but only nearly. Remember that 50 First Dates is an Adam Sandler movie: there are limits.  The more I see of Adam Sandler, the more I appreciate his talent.  ...one mediocre Valentine's Day gift, with all the panache of grocery store chocolate.  'Proporciona un buen rato de diversion para toda la familia. Y decir esto de una pelicula de Sandler es algo para tomar en cuenta.'  Refreshingly original, perfectly paced, and wonderfully sweet.  u mayor logro es sacar a Adam Sandler de sus papeles de neurotico, para demostrarnos que tambien puede interpretar otros roles.  The tone is haphazard and some gags are recycled, but the chemistry between the two stars and an ending that stays true to the story make it a worthwhile rental.  Com excecao de Embriagado de Amor, este e o primeiro filme de Sandler que nao ofende a inteligencia do espectador - e tambem o primeiro a realmente conseguir fazer rir.  With Sandler restrained and Barrymore sweetness incarnate, 50 First Dates compensates for its bitty plot and half-worked gags with a big heart.  For every joke that misfires, there's either a decent joke or a genuinely romantic or heartwarming moment.  The spark between the stars and a surprisingly thoughtful screenplay ensures that, despite the odd gross-out misstep, this is a sweet, warm and funny romantic comedy.  A depressing Rom-Com with more endings than Something's Gotta Give and Return of the King combined.  50 First Dates is another rude and crude stab at romantic comedy with Adam Sandler doing his thing.  It might not be the Sandler of old anymore, but this latest film is an often hilarious reminder of the level the comedian once played at.  ... Sandler has blurred the line between comedy and drama...  If you think PG-13 is still a safe haven for children these days, Sandler (whose appeal and box office muscle continue to baffle) and his ilk have hoodwinked you again.  Stupid, coarse and abysmally unfunny.  This is a potentially sweet and interesting romantic comedy which keeps going for the poo-poo jokes.  But something strange happens once Drew Barrymore shows up -- the movie starts getting good. Really good.  The picture still charms, but it has to work overtime to do so.  . . . a gently silly comedy that's actually romantic without making anyone sick in the process.  As bumpy as the screenplay is, the movie still manages to make us care for the characters.  Daffy and outlandish, it's nevertheless a good first-date movie with a happy ending.  tries to have it both ways: earn tears and sniffling smiles from the sentimental and big guffaws from those who like vomit, penis, and gay jokes  As Barrymore reminds us: Nothing beats a first kiss. Who would have thought an Adam Sandler vehicle in February would be the first romantic comedy in years to mean it?  Fitfully funny and touching, but don't forget it's firstly an Adam Sandler film....Sandler and Segal just can't resist piling on with as many crude jokes as there are dates.  There's a nice blend of comedy and romance at work here...I walked out feeling all warm and happy inside - literally.  A blend of Groundhog Day,Memento, Clean Slate and Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  1/3 slob comedy, 1/3 romantic schmaltz and 1/3 Memento / Groundhog Day. The result is as choppy and unformed as one might expect from such a recipe.  Sandler can&amp;#8217;t eliminate the sophomoric jokes, but opposite Barrymore he is willing to send them to the back burner so their romantic combustion can percolate up front.  Ends up making you pine for Lucy's gift of forgetting.  It's just about impossible to dislike any movie that offers Rob Schneider getting the crap beaten out of him with a baseball bat.  The sweetness is better than the comedy, but we are not overly swamped with either.  A great date movie.  The nagging notion that none of this is funny and much of it is sad dawns early, and that's confirmed when the movie pauses in its manic reprising for sappy sentimentalizing.  This movie paints itself into a corner from which it cannot emerge without becoming an utter disaster as far as I'm concerned.  There's a sweet romance fighting to reach the surface here, but it's ultimately a losing battle against the overpowering and sour Sandler crassness.  [Its good aspects] shame the overriding lack of commitment in finding an assured tone and better jokes.  Sandler was married last summer, and the project seems to represent the star's ecstatic response to the possibility of lifelong true love...  The category is romantic comedy. With the lack of good humor - this film is just merely romantic.  Barrymore and Sandler have absolutely amazing on-screen chemistry.  Every day Drew orders waffles for breakfast and constructs a high-rise out of them, which is not only socially inappropriate but also a violation of local zoning laws.  Even though the film's tagline confidently calls him "the ultimate bachelor," Sandler doesn't walk the walk, and Segal isn't enough of a director to sell it.  Nowhere near as good as The Wedding Singer...but what Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore share on film is most certainly no flash in the pan.  Not exactly memorable.  Dates proves once more Sandler and Barrymore can trump the silliest shtick  Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore shine in this sweet, flirty comedy about a man who falls for a woman with short-term memory loss.  A delightful, breezy, eager-to-please tale of romance that will go down as a career highlight for both lead actors.  A vulgar, contrived and weightless romantic comedy.  The problem with this movie is that it's neither fish nor fowl. It's either a live-action cartoon or a romantic comedy and the transition really doesn't work.  ...a really good Sandler flick that both guys and girls will like.  This is Groundhog Day without the laughs, a lame comedy with all the romantic heat of an ice floe.  As a comedy, it's hit-and-miss. As a romance, it's a home run.  Romance meets neurology in this Adam Sandler-Drew Barrymore romance that only works when she's on-screen.  The film has an odious poodle-poo stench to it. Though watching Rob Schneider be beaten with a baseball bat in one particularly off scene, did seem a bit cathartic...  A chick flick for guys, with a pH balance in perfect equilibrium between the crass and the sweet.  50 First Dates possesses an undeniable heart. The bad news is that it will still be buried underneath layers of stale Sandlerisms tomorrow, and the next day, and the next.  Vast majority of the humor is so grotesquely obvious and crudely presented (in addition to being mildly crude in and of itself) that Sandler dissenters are guaranteed to remain just where they are.  Sandler's shtick is the main thing dragging down this otherwise pleasant romantic comedy, but he's come a long way since the crude, juvenile Billy Madison.  If there's one thing to commend in 50 First Dates, apart from the finest walrus performances this side of Marineland, it's Barrymore, whose irrepressible cheerfulness and buoyancy at least makes Henry's motivation anything but mysterious.  50 First Dates stays bravely true to its unresolvable premise.  An awkward blend of date movie and preadolescent comedy.  The jokes in 50 First Dates aren't jokes, and the bits aren't bits so much as scattershot gestures in the general direction of comedy, at which an audience is expected to laugh, not at the joke, but at the comic's attempt at humor.  Uneven, shapeless and crushingly repetitive.  The underlying theme is lovely and romantic: people should work to win their partners' love every day. It's too bad the execution leaves the audience feeling dumped.  Sandler's character never changes -- his arc goes from nice to nice, and there's no dramatic transformation.  Surprisingly sweet.  A sweet but weightless and witless romantic comedy.  50 First Dates is reasonably good fluff, balancing lovey sentiment and low-brow laughs, though it will likely evaporate from memory as quickly as Lucy forgets her meetings with Henry.  A terrible movie by all reasonable standards -- yet it leaves a sweet taste.  Feels like an improv sketch that can't get off the ground because the performers keep cracking up and having to start over.  it begins with a walrus vomiting... the thought of Sandler seducing dozens of honeys is enough to make anybody feel like that unfortunate walrus (goo goo goo joob).  The film moves in fits and starts, never finding its groove: It's as if the filmmakers could come up with a potentially successful premise but no way of following through.  Neither tolerable nor fun.  There's also a weird sense of laziness with 50 First Dates that impedes a lot of the humor and much of the heart.  50 First Dates is not hideous. It's not horrible. It's not very good, either, but it won't make you want to go out and hurt someone from how bad it is, because it's not that bad.  Each time Schneider is on screen, it's like watching sketch comedy.  Crude, lewd and shameless? You bet.  The only people likely to be disappointed will be those who bother to wonder how good 50 First Dates could have been.  Much of this is very sweet, even touching, but it just isn't funny.  Sandler and Barrymore somehow manage to make the picture work at least some of the time, but you will no doubt wish the material were better -- or at least higher minded.  It may leave women sighing and men wondering why there wasn't at least one more joke about the prodigious endowments of sea lions.  50 First Dates offers a seductive vision of a quirky love. But there is a note of melancholy at the conclusion of this mixed bag of the compassionate and the crude.  The movie doesn't have the complexity and depth of Groundhog Day, but as entertainment it's ingratiating and lovable.  For all the irrelevant silliness, though, the movie never loses sight of its romantic center.  50 First Dates wants to have it both ways, but only one of them really works.  A contrived romantic comedy that can't decide whether to be charming or crass, "50 First Dates" tries to have it both ways and winds up achieving neither.  When not obsessed with hitting the giggly teenage boy demographic, 50 First Dates concentrates on a situation that requires Sandler to act grown up and responsible.  Tries to cram Sandler's typically vulgar modus operandi into a format that is entirely foreign to him. The combination is unpleasant.  Reuniting with the leading lady from his best film (The Wedding Singer), Adam Sandler finds a way to blend his infantile vulgarity with a charming, beguiling love story.  This is Sandler's first romantic comedy that puts romantic first.  Call me crazy, but I like my romantic comedies to actually have a little comedy in them.  When it's good, it's delightful and charming, with enough laughs to make you want to go on 50 dates with Henry and Lucy. When it's bad, it's awful.  It has a core of sweetness that's undeniable, and which allows the humor to grow beyond the fart jokes.  [A]fter the spate of painful rom-coms that have started the movie year, even one that features an explosively vomiting walrus somehow seems like a breath of fresh air.  Let's enact a law that Adam Sandler can only make movies co-starring Drew Barrymore.  This could have been one of the great date movies. But only those hopeless romantics who are dating a stoned frat guy will be totally satisfied with this patchwork picture.  Even by the standards of an Adam Sandler film, 50 First Dates feels like heap of recycled garbage.  Even though it's populated with juvenile antics, 50 First Dates is still a great date movie, cliched as that sounds.  There is something for almost everyone in "50 First Dates" and I recommend it as a first-rate first date flick.  A rental at best and definitely not one of Sandler's most memorable efforts...not by a long shot!  Way closer to a being a post-There's Something About Mary Farrelly brothers movie than Sandler's typical fare.  (Writer George) Wing and director Peter Segal should have demonstrated more faith in their main plot and skimmed these unnecessary diversions like fat off a brisket.  Nothing more than a witless exercise that is so desperate for laughs that it actually stoops to trotting out a vomiting walrus in the first ten minutes...  There's a very sad romance at the heart of 50 First Dates. It keeps peeking its head through only to be smacked back down.  The writing and direction is nowhere near smart enough to get this thing off the ground.  I need no memory loss affliction to forget 50 First Dates almost immediately.  50 First Dates is more of a romantic comedy than an Adam Sandler comedy.  About 25 too many.  Great date-movie material if you can keep your date from bolting during the first half.  It's stupid, yet sweet, so there's a 50-50 chance you'll dig Adam Sandler's twisted romantic comedy.  Rarely have the words 'romantic' and 'comedy' felt more unnaturally forced together than in this latest Adam Sandler vehicle.  Not an Adam Sandler movie, but a normal, potentially sweet romantic comedy with Adam Sandler elements forced on it over its dead body.  Roses are red; violets are blue. It's been over three years; since a good movie starred Drew.  50 First Dates probably will give couples a few laughs but nothing to remember in the morning.  Not amongst Sandler's best, but it still an entertaining enough diversion that succeeds in large part because of the charismatic aura of both the leads.  The film could have made a solid Saturday Night Live skit, but the closest it gets is serving as a reunion for onetime cast members.  50 First Dates is working awfully hard to be romantic and not hard enough to be a comedy.  What starts out looking like another crude, bullying Adam Sandler extravaganza ends up as a surprisingly graceful and impressively daring romantic comedy.  Entertaining? Forget about it. The film is less toxic than most Sandler vehicles, but so is anthrax.  50 First Dates has nothing going for it -- and much going against it.  Although its goofy high-concept premise won't bear much scrutiny, it offers a less predictable ride than their first pairing, and lush Hawaiian locations to boot.  50 First Dates turns a good premise into a romantic comedy that's vulgar, sentimental, and as dumb as the sea creatures the veterinarian hero cares for in a Hawaii aquarium.  While the comedy has its amusing elements the knuckleheaded tone of most scenes prevents the film from generating much real wit.  ...despite Sandler's usual crutch of going way over the top -- 50 First Dates is still a pretty watchable and funny movie.  A drab Groundhog Day retread.  A misogynist comedy obsessed with penis length, bashing sexually ambiguous people and letting a stunted, dopey male snare his ditzy dream babe. . . . cheap, slumming comedy.  Drew Barrymore brings out the best in Adam Sandler  Lucy wakes up every morning with no memory of anything that happened the day before. For the rest of us, everything in this movie is just too, too familiar.  Sandler wants to be charming and still fill his movie with gross comedy, to have his cake and puke it up, too.  When Rob Schneider is the best thing about your movie, you know you have a problem.  Sweet, deeply felt and funny.  While it's not his best work, it's certainly not the worst thing Sandler has made.  50 First Dates is the perfect date movie, one that should appeal to teens into Sandler's mean-spirited shtick, while drawing coos and oohs from those traditionalists drawn to something softer and dreamier.  I don't think 50 First Dates is a great movie, or a particularly funny one, but I admired its romanticism and its gentle plea for the acceptance of difference.  Sandler and Barrymore have some kind of romantic-comedy alchemy together that makes him seem like a genuine catch of a lovable man-boy and makes her flightiness seem cute.  Where Singer had playful angst and skinny-tie nostalgia, Dates has sophomoric locker-room humor.  Sticky but ingratiating.  This pedestrian pic starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore never gets out of neutral, and should have been left in park -- back in the junkyard.  Sandler's movies always have combined juvenile humor with sentimentality, but the two rarely have seemed so out of synch.  Despite its absurdist premise, and the danger of falling into Groundhog Day repetitiveness, 50 First Dates is convincing and works remarkably well.  Pushes all the right buttons and pushes them expertly.  [Rob] Schneider's contribution? Well, he says 'poi poi' a lot.  Decidedly a mixed bag--still, it has enough laughs and charm to be moderately engaging, a definite cut above the usual run of gross-out studio farces released nowadays.  The chemistry between Sandler and Barrymore...is undeniable, a match that goes a long way towards making the film far more compelling than it should be.  [I]t seems as though Adam Sandler is trying to compile a Greatest Hits film...it plays more like a collection of B-sides and outtakes  A sweet romantic, entertaining, unique, romantic picture. Good for a sincere first date, long term partners, or solo if you're on the outs and need a good cry.  The memory-loss device dimly recalls Groundhog Day, though the film's low laugh rate, occasional lachrymosity and flaccid pacing assuredly do not.  like a Valentine's Day present from Adam Sandler - if he hated us, each and every one  The stars have a goo-goo chemistry that's hard to resist.  That 50 First Dates is awful is no surprise--that it appears to have had the potential to be great is just heartbreaking.  Adam Sandler's farewell to movies.  Relies too heavily on juvenile humor.  The Farrellys use the grotesque to illuminate human frailty while filmmakers like Peter Segal stoop low in order to validate their characters.  Tasteless and unfunny: Sandler has still not duplicated the quality of his performance in 'The Wedding Singer.'  an ill-conceived amalgam of sentiment played sweet not sappy, mixed uncertainly with the standard lower-than-low-brown humor with which Sandler's films . . are saturated  </td>

0    Some cool special effects...that&apos;s about it.
1    This is a popcorn film with a fact based concept, and that&apos;s all it is...
2    The ecological theme is not advanced with any subtlety, but so what? The film works with the broad brushstrokes appropriate to a popular entertainment.
3    High-strung, melodramatic hogwash steeped in a measure of scientific fact. Emmerich takes it as seriously as he can and his movie, as a result, delivers more provocative fun than you might expect.
4    Don&apos;t even get me started on the hilarity of the scene where a bunch of people outrun a blast of freezing air and close the doors on it.
