      "My goals after completing the nearest neighbor's analysis was two-fold. First, I wanted to see if I could improve my recommendations using alternate techniques. Second, I wanted to see if I could utilize the actual review text that I had scraped in order to tease out subtle information about HOW the recommended restaurants where related. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the first goal, I performed a latent factor analysis on the residuals of the baseline predictors. This entailed taking the restaurant x user matrix of ratings, and performing SVD on it with a specified number of factors. Unfortunately, this analysis did not perform as well as the nearest neighbors analysis. For any reasonable number of factors, the predictive capababilities of the factorized model were significantly worse than the neighbor's based predictions. Futher, they lacked the explainability of the nearest neighbors model.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the latent factorization technique failed because the ratings are hyper-local in the sense that users tend to primarily rate restaurants from a very small geographic area. As a result, we ended up identifying factors that basically described the locations of restaurants in a very coarse manner, but did not add at all to the prediction.\n",

      "\n",
      "I performed PCA on the matrix of restaurant similarity scores output by the nearest neighbors model. The idea was that this would suffer less from the geographic issues associated with factorizing the ratings with only the baselines removed.\n",

      "\n",
      "As an example, consider the first factor (i.e. the most impactful one) I then ordered the restuarants according to their score in this dimension and binned this ordered list of restaurants (I varied the sizes of bins from 20 to 500 restaurants). \n",
      "I then considered all the review text associated with the restaurants in a bin to be a single document. I only included review texts with 4 and 5 star ratings. I then performed TF-IDF, both comparing the top bins across all factors and comparing the top bin against the bottom bin for any single factor. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also performed the same analysis, using latent dirichlet allocation to discover these topics as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hope is that either of these methods can identify the words and n-grams asssociated with the latent factors determining the similarity sores between restuarants. (In some sense identifying these latent factors). My hope was to then be able to display the words and n-grams associated with the most important factors for each restaurant recommended by my engine as a way of giving the user more information about WHY exactly the two restaurants are similar.\n",

        "' . A lot of great beer options, be it draft or bottled, domestic or imported. It is a cozy space with tons of tables and bartender is very friendly. I was surprised their beer price is rather friendly to neighbors and NYers despite its location. ,I was here for a coworker\\'s farewell party and I think it is a good spot for Happy Hour, After-work events and casual drinks. I was not here long enough to see if it turns to some crazy nightlife scene but definitely a good spot to grab a beer after work. I came here with some friends for a wedding after-party. I love the draft selections here. I also think its cool that they have an area where you can fill up on draft yourself. The bar keep was chill, and the place seems a bit more spacious than ti looks. ,Best part of all is that they had Hudson Corn Whiskey, so i was finally able to try out some legalized moonshine. The barkeep warned me that it would be nasty, but luckily i asked for it chilled. It actually wasn\\'t that bad.,Decent prices, and decent selection of beer makes this place a great joint in the South Street Seaport area. I came here twice now. Once for a bday party and once for happy hour. ,The bartender was nice, he let us sample the beer before we committed to a whole glass which I thought was above and beyond! ,Beer taps on the table, I\\'m not sure how that works but it looks cool. ,The food was standard bar food. We ordered the sloppy joe and sausage and peppers sandwich. We also got the fried pickles. The food was pretty good.,Overall, the four stars goes to the really nice bartender who made us feel right at home! Great service, great beer. \\xc2\\xa0We trekked all the way here for the Koko Brown, a beer that we found in Hawaii. \\xc2\\xa0Its bursting with coconut favor and probably one of the most amazing and unique beers we have ever had. It won some awards! \\xc2\\xa0When we found that Keg 229 carried the beer, we made the trek to the Seaport and it was worth it.,Bartender was super nice, we paired the beer with the Mozzarella Squares which was delicious. ,Can\\'t wait to go back, as long as they keep carrying the Koko Brown! We popped in here yesterday afternoon around 4pm and it was fairly crowded. There is a bunch of tables up front then along the wall, then 4 tables with 2 taps each that you can pour your own beer. The other three tables were full so we opted for the one left. It is a crap shoot with what beer taps you get. I liked one kind but not the other. ,The whole idea is great and I\\'m not sure how someone has not thought of it before. The computer calculates how much you drank from the tap but you can also order whatever you want from the waiter.,I\\'m interested to try the other taps on a future visit as well as the food. It smelled really good. On my initial visit to Keg 229 I didn\\'t order any food and the bartender was grumpy. \\xc2\\xa0For my return the following week, I met one of the owners and ate a delicious lunch. \\xc2\\xa0I\\'m glad I gave this place another chance. \\xc2\\xa0I love American micro brews. \\xc2\\xa0From self-serve taps to a tasty food menu, Keg 229 is a fine addition to the neighborhood. \\xc2\\xa0The chicken pot pie, though more of a stew, was superb. \\xc2\\xa0Bartender was friendly and quick. \\xc2\\xa0My only suggestion is that they fully describe their craft brew selections on the beer menu (ie. stout or IPA?, abv, brewery location, etc...). Cheers! This place is known for their desserts, but the savory items on their menu are fantastic. Yes, it\\'s a noisy restaurant, but if you come during a weekday for lunch you will find it isn\\'t as loud.,When we came here, I ordered the savor waffle: Bacon, Egg, and Cheese waffle. The waffle was slightly sweet, crispy, and chewy. Within the little nooks and crannies lay the cheddar cheese, a nice sharp, but not too sharp variety, and to top the waffle off was a single fried egg. The crispy smoked bacon is between the two waffles, and a little tin of maple syrup comes on the side. I recommend pouring that maple syrup to get the full sweet savory effect. This waffle was so addictive and delicious. ,I also got the corn dogs for an appetizer. They had a thin batter, and came with ketchup and some other sauce. They were good, but pretty standard. ,For dessert, I split a Mint Brownie Sundae. The mint ice cream was cool and refreshing with thin shards of dark chocolate. The brownie bites were more crumbly than fudgey and chewy, but the chocolate sauce was nice and thick. I enjoyed this sundae, but like the Mish Mosh Sundae, I was not wow-ed. ,I think, I\\'ll return for the regular menu, and maybe skip the dessert next time. Their strawberry ice cream is my favorite and one of the best I\\'ve had! ,Everything in here is purple - how do you go wrong with that! :) I\\'m actually stunned. \\xc2\\xa0I remember repeating multiple times through dinner last night, \"I cannot believe how good the food is here.\" \\xc2\\xa0No, not the cookies, sundaes, cake, but the savory food at Sugar and Plumm was AWESOME. \\xc2\\xa0Admittedly, I had fairly low expectations for the \"real\" food at a sweets establishment; however, these low expectations were way more than exceeded. \\xc2\\xa0,The appetizers we chose were excellent. \\xc2\\xa0As others have noted, the pork belly was great. \\xc2\\xa0It was a substantial size and the glaze on it had a delicious sweetness that made me want to finish every last taste. \\xc2\\xa0The entrees were also perfectly executed and scrumptious. \\xc2\\xa0The salmon was cooked to a wonderfully moist and tender medium. \\xc2\\xa0The pulled pork and waffles were also awesome (and also a substantial portion). \\xc2\\xa0,We also tried the ice cream \"cocktails,\" which actually turned out to be boozy milkshakes. \\xc2\\xa0They were filling and definitely satiated my sweet tooth. \\xc2\\xa0Though not that boozy, they had a decent depth of flavor. \\xc2\\xa0My favorite was the Vacation. \\xc2\\xa0 ,We were so full after all of this that we had to take dessert to go. \\xc2\\xa0The peanut butter pie was a total hit. \\xc2\\xa0The graham cracker crust was delicious. \\xc2\\xa0I also really enjoyed the creme brulee cookie. \\xc2\\xa0,The service was a bit slow but our waitress more than made up for it in trying to ensure that all of our needs were met. \\xc2\\xa0,I would highly recommend Sugar and Plumm for a tasty dinner on the UWS. Based solely on the cookies, coffee and the friendly service, this place is easily 5 star-worthy.,Every time I\\'m in this area, I find it hard to justify trying anything other than a Levain cookie for dessert, but this place always looks glorious to me with such a beautiful display of pastries and packaged chocolates and other sweets for sale.,Dare I say it, the Chocolate Chunk Cookie ($3.50) almost made me forget about the cookies at Levain. Not quite as massive as those delicious balls of undercooked cookie dough, this one was just as buttery and nearly as amazing. They pack in a ton of chocolate and you can just smell the buttery goodness as you bite into it. If you want one of the best cookies in the city, but can\\'t quite commit to the pound of cookie at Levain, you must come try this.,We also tried the intriguing sounding Creme Br\\xc3\\xbbl\\xc3\\xa9e Cookie ($3.50). Must softer than the firm Chocolate Chunk Cookie, this one was also really great. Another buttery cookie, I found it hard to stop eating this one as well, though it wasn\\'t quite as good as the chocolate chunk.,The coffee happened to be really good. I got a large iced coffee ($3.50 again), which was good enough that no sweetener nor milk was needed. They have a long communal table for loitering in the front where you can enjoy your pastries.,All I tried was the walk-up pastry counter, but they have a full menu of tons of sweet stuff for brunch, lunch and dinner. I would love to come back to try the rest of the stuff, like some chicken and waffles and the great-sounding shakes. I cannot believe it\\'s only 3.5 stars! Get outta here! Best brunch EVER. ,Tina W. took me to this wonderland for my birthday. I don\\'t mean to brag, but I\\'ve had a lot of brunches, and this... this was just unbelievable. Better than Alice\\'s Tea Cup (1,2 AND 3), better than Sarabeth\\'s (THAT\\'S RIGHT, I SAID IT). ,CHICKEN N WAFFLES?! COME TO ME. I didn\\'t expect a place like this to serve that well, if at all. It was one of the best fried chicken I\\'ve ever had in my life. Juicy and tender on the inside, lightly crispy on the outside. Perfection. ,Lemon Ricotta Pancakes -- better than Sarabeth\\'s! 3 huge stacks of warm, fluffy, flavorful pancakes... DROOL. ,Salmon Eggs Benedict -- was amazing but overshadowed by my CHICKENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!,What\\'s unique about this place is that other than the restaurant part, there\\'s also macarons, bakery, boxed sweets/chocolates, and stuffed animals for purchasing. ,LOVE. All you boys, take your gf here for brunch!,This is definitely the cutest place I\\'ve ever eaten at.. much cuter than Alice\\'s Tea Cup or Serendipity! Sugar and Plumm is like a candy land fairy tale. The door handles into the bakery/restaurant are in the shape of lollipops. The walls are painted with cute cakes! Everything about this place is cute, even the name!,Once you walk in, the bakery items are in the front and the right side has a casual table for eating the small bakery items/sweets. Also, there is a small area with boxed candies, boxed chocolate and stuffed animals for purchase! Table service is located on the left side where I sat and enjoyed my breakfast with good company.,We all ordered different plates to share. Lemon ricotta pancakes, Chicken and waffles and Salmon eggs benedict. I LOVED everything, from the presentation to the taste. The chicken was lightly fried and did not taste oily at all. The texture was crispy and the inside was juicy. The pancakes were also fluffy and garnished with fresh, colorful fruits on top. Salmon eggs benedict -- can\\'t ever go wrong with that! Prices are also reasonable.,After our meal, we explored the right side and bought some macarons to go. They had rose-lychee flavored macaron! So soft and delicious. I wish I bought more.,I\\'m not sure why other people are so harsh in their reviews about this place. I loved it and I will '"

        "'I don\\'t understand the hype about this place. I tried their classic shoyu ramen, which wasn\\'t bad, but certainly not the best I\\'ve had either. The noodles were not firm enough for my liking and the soup wasn\\'t flavorful enough. It didn\\'t come anywhere close to Ippudo and Totto for sure, and I thought it wasn\\'t even as good as Setagaya, Jin Ramen, Minka, etc. Plus, the portion is really small for the price you pay. $12 for a small bowl of ramen with just one piece of charsiu and scallion?? It\\'s really not worth it. I may come back once more to try their mazemen since it sounds more unique and interesting, but so far, I\\'m very underwhelmed with this place. No need to go out of your way to try it out. This ramen place is located inside Gotham Market which is on West End. It\\'s quite a hike from the subway and public transit in general, so the question becomes: is it worth the trip?,While the ramen is satisfactory, it really doesn\\'t justify the adventure for food sakes. The Gotham Market is really cool and I highly recommend it to everyone who lives nearby. I happen to live on West End Avenue about twenty blocks north, so it\\'s not too far of a journey. ,Back to food though. The ramen is fine, but really just average and doesn\\'t live up to all the hype. The donburi dishes are better which is surprising considering that this place is supposed to be all about the ramen. I was also a bit disappointed about the small portion sizes. Maybe I\\'m just a pig though. Overall the hype was too high for this place and Ivan just got swept beneath it. The hubby and I are (good) ramen virgins, unless you count Cup o Ramen.... I have been tremendously curious about \"good\" ramen and was super excited to see Ivan Ramen Slurp Shop at the Gotham Market. I could buy a bowl (or 2) and if I didn\\'t like it, I wasn\\'t committed to it like I would be in a restaurant. We could have something else.,I was super happy with my ramen! I asked the counterperson what she would recommend for a ramen newbie? She suggested both the soy based and sea salt based ramen - SOLD - with a soft boiled egg in each.,The soy ramen was super salty (in a good way) with chucks of pork belly and yummy noodles. The sea salt ramen was a bit less salty. Both were great. Truth be told, the hubby and I preferred the soy based ramen to the sea salt. My girls loved it too.,Next time I would get more pork belly and egg in the soy based ramen. Can\\'t wait to come back!! Hype! But do you wanna know something? I don\\'t care. Try to get into Ippudo at 7pm on a Thursday. Ha! (You ain\\'t getting in for a while sucka),However, Ivan Ramen Slurp Shop has you covered. There is a nice open area where you can order a hot bowl of Ramen. I ordered the \"Spicy Red Chili Ramen\" It comes with dashi and smashed egg. Spicy!!,The Ivan Ramen Slurp Shop chef is an american chef who studied in Japan and brought you slurpy shop ramen with no wait. Did I say no wait? Get your ramen on babycakes!,I liked the ramen at Ivan Ramen Slurp Shop, hyped up or not :D I heard read things about Ivan\\'s but I approached skeptically. I had the spiced chili ramen which took them a while -15 or 20 min to serve to me. If it takes that long to serve, one would assume it would be hot. My broth was almost room temperature, the noodles a tad too hard, and the egg cold. It was terrible. I didn\\'t bother finishing it. Muslims, Jews, and vegans, rejoice: it\\'s hard to find a bowl of ramen in the city that doesn\\'t have pork in it, or that\\'s vegan but still good. \\xc2\\xa0Ivan Ramen\\'s got you covered. \\xc2\\xa0They\\'ve got all the pork you want, but also have chicken broth and chicken chashu, which I\\'ve never seen anywhere else. \\xc2\\xa0As for the vegan part--all I know is there were two vegans at my table and they were pleased.,The dishes we got were a mixed bag: ,+ I ordered the Tokyo Shoyu Ramen, all chicken, with an extra egg and extra tomato. \\xc2\\xa0The broth was too salty but that\\'s pretty much my takeaway from every ramen I\\'ve ever had. \\xc2\\xa0The rye noodles were delicious and, I suspect, perfectly cooked. \\xc2\\xa0The egg was a full egg--not one half, both halves--and the yolk was still soft and a little runny. \\xc2\\xa0Nice. \\xc2\\xa0,- My friend had a different experience, ordering the Garlic Mazemen Ramen, less a soup with noodles than noodles with some soup. \\xc2\\xa0The verdict here was that whle the noodles were excellent, the dish overall was... a little bit crappy. \\xc2\\xa0(Very articulate, I know, but that was the takeaway.) \\xc2\\xa0And my friend suspects it made her ill, to boot. \\xc2\\xa0,- Aside from ramen, we split the whitefish donburi, which is basically just whitefish on rice. \\xc2\\xa0There are other ingredients in the bowl; they contribute nothing. \\xc2\\xa0If you know what whitefish tastes like and you\\'ve eaten white rice, you can make this dish in your imagination and then not order it here.,+ Lastly, for a drink, the \"Ivan Palmer\", a twist on an Arnold Palmer--instead of ice tea and lemonade, they used their own ice decaf barley tea and yuzu lemonade. \\xc2\\xa0I liked each of the ingredients on their own, and I liked them together. Ivan Ramen is tasty ramen. \\xc2\\xa0I came here looking to be wow\\'d and I wasn\\'t. \\xc2\\xa0But was it bad? \\xc2\\xa0No. \\xc2\\xa0Was it amazing? \\xc2\\xa0No. \\xc2\\xa0It was OK.. and therefore gets the 3 stars it deserves. \\xc2\\xa0Here are my TIPS for eating here:,* Ivan Ramen is inside the Gotham West Market. \\xc2\\xa0Upon entering the main Gotham West Market entrance (entrance is on 11th ave), it\\'s immediately in front of you towards the right.,* Order at the counter (there are two registers) and have a seat wherever. \\xc2\\xa0When your order is ready they call out your name and someone with a tray will either come over to where you\\'re sitting (or just hand it to you). \\xc2\\xa0,* Cash and cards accepted,* The size of the ramen is \\'normal\\'. \\xc2\\xa0It\\'s not a \"big ol\\' bowl o\\' ramen\" and nor does it leave you hungry. \\xc2\\xa0It\\'s right in there... and if I had to choose one side of the scale, I\\'d say it\\'s a little smaller,* Ramen will run you about $12.. you can opt for \"Fully Loaded\" for an extra $5 which means two tomatoes, egg (a hard white and a soft/semi-oozy yolk), and extra meat (chicken or pork). \\xc2\\xa0I had mixed feelings about the tomato. \\xc2\\xa0It provides a bit of sweetness, but overall -- I kept thinking in my head \"which one doesn\\'t belong!\" (The answer is the tomato, in case you are confused).,* Restrooms are the same shared restrooms for the entire Gotham Market. \\xc2\\xa0Find them on the other side of where you\\'re at (i.e. walk north).,* There are people who in general \"work for Gotham Market\" that clean up / clear trays... but if they haven\\'t come by and nicely asked if you\\'re done and cleared your plates... then by golly, go DIY.,* This place is not close to anything. \\xc2\\xa0If you want to cab out of here, most cabs are running South on 11th ave, exit Gotham Market, and go stand on the south west corner of the street to get a cab pretty easily. 3, 3.5, maybe.,The ramen was not bad. I tried the shoyu ramen with the works, which is a pork broth based ramen, served with rye noodles, roasted pork, a very runny (++++) soft boiled egg, and a roasted tomato. I liked the rye noodles, it\\'s a lot less bouncy than your usual ramen noodle, probably closer to soba but with a little bit more chewiness. \\xc2\\xa0The broth had a nice rich pork flavor without too much greasiness and the roasted tomato added a nice sourness that almost served as a palate cleanser between each new slurp of ramen.,But Gotham West Market is way too damn far. It didn\\'t help that the day I decided to go it was raining, snowing, cold, and windy. It was a good day for ramen though.,A tip - try to sit at the counter if you can. That\\'s where the action is, and makes having a $13 - $17 dollar bowl of ramen a little bit more interactive. I recommend getting the works, even then, I was still pretty hungry afterwards. \\xc2\\xa0The more you know. I\\'m pretty shocked at the negative reviews. I know ramen is supposed to be a low maintenance food, but I\\'m pretty sure rent in brand new Gotham West Market is not cheap. And midtown lunchers please raise your hands if you regularly spend $11 at Pret or Chopt. Value is a factor, but not the only factor.,The shio ramen I tried was delicious. The broth was incredibly smoky and luxurious, thickened with schmaltz. I\\'m admittedly a slow ramen eater, a non-slurper, and the rye noodles held up to my pokey pace without decomposing. The large hunk of pork was perfectly juicy, and had the satisfying stickiness that indicates proper cooking duration. I wanted to try Ivan Ramen because of all the stuff I read about it but frankly I\\'m unimpressed. While the noodles itself was quite good the broth lacked in flavor and character. And you can\\'t have good ramen when your broth is mediocre. The smoked fish donburi sounded interesting but overall I was underwhelmed as well. I\\'m willing to give them another shot and perhaps visit their restaurant in the LES but with all the hype surrounding Ivan Orkin I\\'m really disappointed that he didn\\'t deliver. So for now it\\'s a 2 star review and I\\'m gonna say in the Yuji vs Ivan ramen question I\\'m a Yuji fan! Probably the most disappointing of my food experiences at Gotham West. I really was disappointed in the price for the quantity, and they really skimped on pork.,I\\'d be making that non-impressed face if you could see my face right now. There are much better places for ramen in the city. I\\'m sure there are many chefs out there who wish the problems with their restaurants could be easily fixed as Ivan Ramen\\'s. ,When Ivan\\'s first American venture opened in the upscale food court West Gotham Market a few months ago, there was a common complaint among a sizable minority of reviewers - the portion of ramen was inadequate. This wasn\\'t a meal, it more a snack.,By the time I arrived with a friend a few weeks ago, an option had been added for an extra helping of noodles, a piece of roast pork and an egg for $2. Warned by the Internet, we both opted for the \\'super-sized\\' serving of Ivan ramen. ,What a great choice. The noodles on offer were so tasty that I\\'d probably wanted more no matter the original portion, and well, it was needed. The upgraded bowl of noodles was comparable in price to what you\\'d get at Ippudo, but much better. They were thinner than others I had, with less of a bite but a fuller flavor. ,I went with the garlic mazamen, an almost dry concoction with hints of dash and seaweed. I slurped it down in just a couple of minutes, not able to savor each bite as I was ready for more.,Despite the avalanche of hype (including the two star review in the Times) we were able to sit at mixed counter seating in the middle of the food court without a wait on a recent Friday evening. Beer is available from elsewhere in the market, along with wine from the tapas restaurant. There\\'s no table staff, but there\\'s also no one hurrying you out after finishing the bowl. Like many others, I was excited to hear about the opening of Gotham West Market and the arrival of Ivan Ramen; after all, who hasn\\'t heard about the American chef who achieved success in Japan, the very birthplace of ramen? Upon his return to the states, there\\'s been no small amount of buzz and excitement over his newest projects, the first of which is Ivan Ramen Slurp Shop.,Gotham West Market is a bit of a hike, located in MIdtown West along 11th Avenue and 45th Street, and Ivan Ramen sits in its Southeast corner. It\\'s a simple, no-frills stop in the upscale food court; there\\'s an area for guests to order and pick up their food, as well as a long counter table where guests can observe the kitchen while enjoying their meal. Thanks to the set up of Gotham West, there\\'s also plenty of two-top tables spread throughout the venue, in case those coveted counter seats are taken.,As for the food options, there\\'s not too much choice available across the succinct menu. There\\'s the standard shio and shoyu ramen options, several versions of the mazemen, with a list of toppings and additions available for an additional charge. There\\'s also a number of donburi (rice bowls), sides, and drinks to help round out the meal. The two of us opted to get our own bowls of ramen and on a last-minute decision, added on a donburi to share.,So, the bad: The Roasted Garlic Mazemen that I\\'d anticipated for so long (I\\'m looking at you, SeriousEats) was nothing short of a disappointment. How do I even start with the number of things wrong with this bowl? The small amount of broth (as mazemen is supposed to be a \"dry\" ramen style) was completely lackluster; served lukewarm, overly-salted, and unbalanced in the amount of garlic that was added, I almost couldn\\'t believe my tastebuds the first few spoonfuls in. The rye noodles that had been praised so many times were limp, soggy, and lacked the chew or texture of good ramen, and the addition of a semi-ridiculous amount of scallions on top just made it more difficult to eat. Portion-wise, it\\'s far less generous than most other ramen spots in the city, and will leave you looking for more when (or if) you finish.,The one solid dish here was, surprisingly, the Pork Donburi. A moderate portion of white rice is served with shredded pork shoulder, three roasted plum tomatoes, and a hefty sprinkling of chopped green onion. The pork is savory with a hint of sweet, tender, and well-seasoned while the tomatoes add some much needed acidity to the bowl. There\\'s even a hint of salted plum wasabi for an additional kick, which I was happy to discover.,I hope the hype for this place has died down; given the number of better ramen joints in the city, Ivan Ramen pales in comparison. That, in addition to the above average prices and lengthy trek, should be more than enough to deter you from visiting. Dang, Ivan Ramen gets an average of three stars? So much good ramen in New York, the residents are spoiled and tough on the ramen slingers! This is a good place to eat.,My wife ordered the vegetarian ramen, which was very umami and mushroomy. I ordered the spicy ramen and it was SPICY and quite good. Usually I don\\'t prefer the spiciest ramens (though I love spicy foods), but this one hit the spot. The wheat noodles here are a little thinner and seem a little less \"rameny\" but they are good. The place is elbow to elbow at picnic style tables, but you should be able to find a seat. For a city that boasts a lot of great ramen, Ivan is no slouch, and deserves a visit. I was looking forward to finally getting some good ramen. ,Disappointment ensued when I discovered that underneath the shrubbery of green onions, there was one piece of pork chashu. For a $13 bowl of ramen (+$2 for ONE EGG!), I felt jipped. I will admit, it was a good piece of chashu -- fatty and thick, but otherwise just okay. ,As for the ramen, I understand there are different types, and I prefer the thick, wavy, al dente kind. This was a thinner ramen but still chewy. Not memorable. ,I got the classic shio and I enjoyed the broth. My companions preferred the shoyu, which was saltier and heavier. ,My friend ordered hers \"fully loaded\" -- with egg, extra piece of pork chashu, etc... but that was too pricey for a bowl of noodles.,Get the yuzu lemonade ($3)! I went to try Ivan Ramen because it was featured (at a very high rank) in the NYT\\'s top 10 ramen joints in New York. As much as I like the idea of this place, it has no business being on any top 10 list for Japanese ramen (or a variation of Japanese ramen).,The broth flavoring is too overpowering and does not let the palette taste the freshness of any of the other ingredients. I needed to add a bit of water to the bowl because the sodium level is off the charts. The pork is decent, but I\\'m not a fan of how these bowls were executed in general. I wanted to like it since it\\'s located fairly close to me, but the fact that this was ranked ahead of Totto, Ippudo and Hide-Chan is laughable. ,At the end of the day, it\\'s not a $17 bowl of ramen. It\\'s barely worth half that amount. Small portions for the price. ,I appreciate not having to pay tip since it\\'s a food court. ,It\\'s a unique ramen since they use soba noodles, \\xc2\\xa0but not really my thing. \\xc2\\xa0The broth is not your typical pork bone broth we have all been conditioned to love. ,Some may love it some might not. \\xc2\\xa0I thought it was unique and maybe us Americans need to learn the different styles of broths.,I\\'ll have to check out his lower east side location once that opens up. Kick ass. \\xc2\\xa0Ivan Ramen, located in the Gotham West Market, is a treat for those seeking wholesome ramen goodness. Admittedly, the ordering process was a bit messy. Our group was sitting at the bar talking with the staff, but unclear where to place our orders. \\xc2\\xa0Once we figured that out, it was pretty smooth sailing.,I had the Classic Shoyu with soy sauce, chashu and rye noodles, and ordered it \"Fully Baked\" which included egg, extra chashu, roasted tomatoes and chili garlic oil. \\xc2\\xa0This was amazing. I also tried the roasted garlic mazemen \\'fully baked\\', but preferred the Classic better.,Then, our table shared a smoked whitefish donburi rice bowl, which had salmon roe, sweet soy dashi, cucumber and scallion. Delicious!,The waited brought us a small sample of their new Negi Salad, which was a nice touch, (although not a spectacular dish). ,Topped off with a \\xc2\\xa0Dr Brown\\'s Cel-Ray, and the meal was complete. Tasty, different ramen with other good dishes as well. ,I arrived with a friend on a Saturday at 11:45 or so, and there wasn\\'t too long of a wait. We split an order of the white fish donburi, which was really good, made of high quality ingredients and all mixing very well together. As for the ramen, I had an order of the garlic mazeman, which was unique and quite flavorful. I can understand why people who are looking for traditional ramen might be disappointed (different flavored broth, noodles a bit too tender), but I still found it to be tasty and enjoyable. I also had a small yuzu lemonade, which was not bad but very sweet.,There\\'s decent seating space around the counter and is not too crowded around noon time on a weekend, although it might get a bit more crowded later. It\\'s definitely a bit pricey, especially given the amount of toppings they give you, but it\\'s a tasty meal and a place I\\'d return to. Really happy Ivan Ramen has a spot here in Midtown for people to enjoy. The space inside the Gotham Market is perfect for his unique bowls of ramen as well as other speciality items. I only had time to try the ($12) Shio Ramen with toasted rye noodles. It added an American touch on Japanese style noodles. I love the extra soft boiled egg too!! It really completes the noodles. ,Its so sad to see so many people complain about the price. I guess most people dont understand the concept of quality food and the price we pay to get good quality food. Ivan doesnt source for your local grocery store\\'s cheap meat. He goes to purevors and also customizes his own recipe for toasted rye noodles from Sun Noodles. The broth for the soups take hours and hours to make. Sometimes overnight. So sad to see how people can\\'t appreciate their food and the craft from people who are truly committed to making good food.,If you guys keep comparing it to Minca, Totto, or Ippudo then this place is not for you. It is much different and the techniques and style isn\\'t going to compare. As David Chang said, \"Ivan is the Eminem of Ramen.\" Too much flavor, if such a thing is possible. The slow roasted pork rice bowl was so overfilled with pork and sauce I needed a bucket of water to drown it down. Am now craving a huge salad. Plum wasabi sauce was an unwelcome addition to the rice. ,Ramen portion is pretty small. The broth was pretty tasty, but again flavors overload. Finally, we get to try Ivan\\'s ramen in NY, and it was worth the wait.,Though he has a shop that\\'s been supposed to be about to open on the Lower East Side for months, this small outpost will do nicely to tide us over until then.,I arrived in the Gotham West Market, where this is one of the best choices, on the first day it was open right around prime lunch time at about 1 PM. You could tell they are still getting into the swing of things, as they were very friendly and accommodating and apologetic about the wait. There was a very large crowd of people lined up, but the line to order was completely empty. I walked right up to place my order from the small menu, and then waited with the rest of the crowd for around 20 minutes for the food.,When I finally tasted the ramen and rice bowl, it was completely worth it. I tried the Classic Shio Ramen ($13) with an egg added in ($2). This is pretty pricey for a smallish bowl of ramen, but it really was delicious. Since it is a chicken broth it is lighter than I normally like and not as rich as some of the pork-based broths, but it still had some serious flavor. They are also rye noodles, which were different and delicious.,You obviously have to try the ramen, but do not miss the rice bowls. We also tried the Smoked Whitefish Donburi ($12), which I enjoyed even more than the ramen. This is the one I feel like they could\\'ve gotten away with charging a lot more for, as they give you a really generous amount of salmon roe along with the deliciously salty whitefish. This bowl is incredibly flavorful and kind of tasted like Japan.,Ivan was hard at work cranking out the ramen behind the bar. Afterwards he was walking around the market talking to customers and generally just being a really nice guy too, which is always nice to see.,I expected a wait like this for the first day, but I hope they get their act together soon since I could see them getting slammed during the lunch and dinner rushes. I will definitely be back very soon to try some of the other ramen varieties and the Pork Donburi. KenScale: 8.0/10,Ivan Ramen Slurp Shop is a new ramen shop from Gotham West Market, which recently opened in the Hells Kitchen area. The owner of this shop is Ivan Orkin, a Caucasian who gained critical acclaim for his work on ramen in Tokyo and beyond. He was supposed to open up a shop in Lowest East Side, but instead this shop came first. ,I tried a bowl of classic shoyu ramen made of chicken and dashi double soup, pork chashu, and rye noodle. The noodle\\'s texture was great without being too soft or tough, and the soup was rich and flavorful without being overwhelming to my palate. I wish there was something more other than one piece of pork, but overall the dish was a pretty good meal on a late afternoon, especially combined with tasty sweet and spicy eggplant. It was a different kind of ramen from those I had at Ippudo or Momofuku shops, a simple-looking dish that nevertheless had something unique to offer in flavor.,I stepped in to Gotham West Market slightly past 2 p.m. on Sunday, and it was pretty relaxing. While the line of people could get longer at times, you still can grab seats pretty easily as the turnover of the cafeteria-style dining hall is relatively fast. I can\\'t wait to try Orkin\\'s other dishes and see what he has to offer. Definitely another welcome addition to the hugely popular ramen dining scene in NYC. With the opening of Gotham West Market, Ivan Ramen Slurp Shop has also made its way to Hell\\'s Kitchen. Once you enter Gotham West Market, you\\'ll be transformed right into a big, glorified food court. With so many places to eat, which do you even pick? Ivan Ramen Slurp Shop is located in the upper right corner of the marketplace. Like a food court, approach the cashier, make your order, and grab a seat anywhere nearby.,As far as ramen goes, Ivan Ramen has 5 bowls to choose from: shoyu, shio, vegetable shoyu, roasted garlic mazemen, chili garlic mazemen. \\xc2\\xa0I went with the shoyu ramen ($13), which was just right at the median price for a bowl of ramen in the city. I took a seat right at the counter, and within 5 minutes, my bowl was ready to go. The shoyu ramen came loaded with their rye noodle and their chicken and dashi broth. I was pretty curious about this broth since it was relatively on the unique side, and rye noodles was a different twist as well. However, once I took a look at my bowl, I immediately thought, wow, this is a smaller portion than I expected. ,Taking a bite into the thin rye noodles, they reminded me of Chinese noodles as opposed to the firmer and thicker noodle that is typically used. \\xc2\\xa0The chashu that accompanied my noodles was pretty tender, which is always a well welcomed treat. As far as the broth goes, it actually wasn\\'t bad. Some might say that it\\'s a tad on the saltier side, but then again, you\\'re getting either shio or shoyu ramen. There definitely was a hint of that chicken flavor within the broth which you could distinctly taste. Did I feel completely satisfied though? Not completely. I felt there were just some missing elements. Whether it be charging extra for an egg, or missing things such as menma, those are all small tidbits, but nice tidbits at that. ,For $13, you get an okay bowl of noodles. The bowl is small, but then again, you don\\'t have to suffer through a 30min+ wait in comparison to Ippudo and Totto. Then again, \\xc2\\xa0Ippudo and Totto are both a couple blocks away, which makes this place hard to justify. I\\'m very comfortable giving this 3 stars, and I would even give it 2 because the title is \\'Meh, I\\'ve experienced better\\' - which I definitely have - but 2 is pretty low and it looks bad for them; and I don\\'t want to sully Mr. Ramen\\'s business. ,I had the whitefish donburi and the garlic mazeman. Both were pretty expensive, at the level of some of the more \"authentic\" places but the environment is nothing close to what those would be. The fact is that this is in a food court. An Anytown, USA artisanal food court indistinguishable from places like this in just about any other hipster haven in many other cities I\\'ve been in. I see some value in having so many \"elevated\" food places together, but none that I would justify paying extra for - the scene is not preferable to an actual restaurant. And as far as the food - it was fine. Any misgivings in the donburi for being dry can definitely be forgiven, and the mazeman dish was definitely o-kay, but not preferable to any other ramen place. ,Mr. Ivan Ramen seems like a nice guy, and it was cool how he was walking around like Mr. Paulie Gee, but the heart and soul of the place is nowhere near in comparison. He plans to open a place in Lower Manhattan, and I wish him luck, and I hope that the new place has some more character as he gains more control - because \\xc2\\xa0this \"Brooklyn\" that people like to draw comparisons to is not what makes Brooklyn special. What makes it special is all the creativity and craftiness and quality, not this developer, PR firm, real estate business curation business. I\\'m not going to pay a premium to be here. Not in this sanitized mall. This box could exist anywhere in any town - I want to eat and live in New York. ,In another comparison, in another food court; Yuji Ramen in Whole Foods Smorg is sooo much better. Night and day. I feel dirty going to big businesses like Whole Foods, but I have to admit... Yuji\\'s ramen is totally enjoyable, even for the price/portion. ,Are the 5-star writers here lemmings or am I misguided and misinformed? Whatever, they can have their opinion, but in my next trip to the Gotham West food court, I will be heading to the Saltie shop or the Roadhouse bourgeois place. Don\\'t get me wrong, Ivan ramen is good in a minmalistic purtist type of way but it definitely isn\\'t worth my $13 a bowl. It comes with scallions and one piece of pork. You can add on other things but it will quickly add up to maybe $20. ,I thought the noodles were good and the broth had depth. I wish I had gotten the shio ramen instead of the shoyu cause mine was a bit salty but my boyfriend\\'s shio was spot on. ,We also shared the white fish don and that was ok as well. ,Service was great. Ivan\\'s unfortunately just doesnt do it for me. I have visited twice now - 1x for a pre opening event at the market during NYCWFF and more recently for dinner after a pickling class in neighboring brooklyn kitchen. ,at the event they were handing out small samples of cold noodles which we did not enjoy at all. we probably would not have revisited except that some of our favorite food bloggers gave a rave review so we decided to give them another shot. we tried the shia and the shoyu unfortuntely both fell flat for us. \\xc2\\xa0not that anything was necessarily bad, it just didnt have nearly as much flavor as i am used to from other ramen shops in the city. i even added the chili oil but couldnt manage to get the kick i was looking for. i did enjoy the noodles which seemed maybe a bit chewier / more dense but that alone is not enough to bring me back. I don\\'t know if it defeats the purpose of ordering a vegetarian dish, but adding the pork chasu to the chili eggplant mazeman was one of the more delicious moves I\\'ve made in the recent past.,The two pieces of pork were some of the most tender and succulent offerings I\\'ve had with ramen, and the rye noodles were absolutely outstanding. \\xc2\\xa0Granted, the portions were noticeably smaller than what frequenters of Totto or Ippudo may be used to, but the unfamiliar yet delightful texture and taste of the rye noodles was a winner, and made the trip out worth it.,The broth of the chili eggplant mazeman was also delicious; the smoked chili imparted not so much spiciness, but a more rounded and full savouriness to every spoonful of noodles. \\xc2\\xa0The roasted garlic mazeman was a bit thicker and heavier with the sauce coating each noodle in almost like an Italian cream sauce, and leaving you feeling perhaps a bit more satiated than the chili eggplant did. \\xc2\\xa0But if I had to choose to have one of the two again, I\\'d go for the chili eggplant. \\xc2\\xa0And yes, topped with the pork chasu. Again.,Skip the negi salad - it\\'s pretty much the same scallions that they dress each bowl of noodles with, and not really worth getting an entire side plate\\'s worth. \\xc2\\xa0The curry rice was also tasty and authentic, although I still think the ramen is still the dish to get if this is your first time here. You know, it\\'s not bad. I agree that it is a bit on the pricier side for what amounts to an ok amount of ramen, but I think it\\'s fairly flavorful. I ended up getting their spicy special and got egg in it for under $15. I was already glowering when I got the bowl thinking it wouldn\\'t be enough, but sure enough with all the broth and extra fixins I put in it I was pretty satisfied with the food but disappointed in myself that I couldn\\'t finish. Is it going to be at the top of places to go for ramen? No, but it\\'s fairly solid, if a little on the expensive side. I have been anticipating the opening of this shop! Finally, it\\'s here & lovely to be located in Gotham West Market.,In terms of the ramen, it\\'s pretty good... Very crisp on terms of texture and they\\'re made of rye. However, I was disappointed that they only included 2 pieces of charshu, which were more on the fatty side. The scallions also added a nice crunch on top of the noodles and meat.,One order is perfect to hit the spot but I shared it with a friend as a snack. At the new market west eatery you\\'ll find Ivan Orkin\\'s ramen shop. Ramen bar seating and benches and tables in front there is ample area to eat ramen. You\\'ll find a small menu of items.,I went for the shoyu ramen, pickled cucumbers, spiced garlic side, and a egg. I would say for a ramen shop this is quite pricey which is why i lowered it a star as well being small portions. The ramen broth could also have come more hot as my broth was a bit above warm and not hot. In Hell\\'s Kitchen Ivan will find plenty of compettion from Ippudo and Totto which offer larger portions at a lower price without all the addons. I was a fan of the spiced garlic side as the roasted garlic and spices really came out quit tasty. The pickles were also ok but nothing to cry home about. The ramen broth was a light based soy broth and not as rich as some of the other ramen shops in the area. The wheat based ramen was a standout though. Chewy and a nice taste the way i like ramen to be cooked. ,For the price and portions and not a standout as far as ramen i wouldn\\'t go as a destination eating spot but if in the area i may stop in again. Ivan\\'s shio ramen was a solid, basic bowl of ramen. But NYT top 10*? Up there with the likes of Totto, Ippudo, and Mu? Most definitely not. Especially with such high expectations, I was left seriously unimpressed.,The classic shio ramen at Ivan is literally just a bowl of dashi+chicken broth, rye noodles, scallions, and ONE piece of pork chashu. I can honestly say that I\\'ve never been to a ramen ya that serves just one piece of chashu in their ramen; it\\'s usually at least two pieces. Extras like eggs, pork chashu, roasted tomatoes, and chili garlic oil will cost you, and you can opt to have your ramen fully loaded (with eggs, extra piece of pork, and roasted tomatoes) for $17. To give you a price comparison, Ippudo\\'s classic tonkotsu and akamaru modern ramens cost $15 each, and all of Totto\\'s ramens are priced below $12, not to mention that all of these are larger than Ivan\\'s \"fully-loaded\" ramen. That said, the pork chashu at Ivan was really good, and I enjoyed the thin and springy rye noodles unique to Ivan Ramen. My friend ordered the spicy red chili ramen which I do not recommend. I\\'m a lover of all things spicy but Ivan\\'s red chili broth was all pepper and lacked the smokey richness I\\'m accustomed to in spicy ramen broths. ,Overall, Ivan is at 2.5 stars for me, but I\\'m rounding down since there\\'s really nothing motivating me to trek all the way out to 11th Ave again for another bowl. I do think, though, that Ivan Ramen can be good if you adjust your expectations. With cafeteria style seating and counter ordering, Ivan is more like fast food than a traditional ramen ya. And I daresay if you go in expecting a fast food experience you\\'ll have a much higher chance of loving it. In taste, they\\'re winners in a class of lightweights. Unfortunately their price point puts them into the heavyweight category and they just don\\'t hold up against their competition.,* The garlic ramen was very good but perhaps a bit too salty.,Very casual place. Haven\\'t tried their other location yet. What a joke. I\\'ve read reviews lauding the opening of Gotham West Market as far back as November. When I heard that a ramen shop opened up I was obviously excited to try it.,....Heed the warnings of these fellow yelp reviewers, the ramen here is a joke. The broth is barely passable and the portion size is comical. By comical I mean take your already hesitant attitude to spend ~$14-17 on a bowl of ramen that you do at other ramen places and cut that serving size into about a third of the usual size. ,ARE YOU KIDDING ME. Why would you play around with portion size when it comes to serving Asian food??? Do you really think that Asians, being as frugal and as concerned with food quality as we are, would settle for a dog paw\\'s full of ramen for that much money?,Ivan, I don\\'t know who you are, but from all the press coverage I\\'ve seen of this new ramen shop, it\\'s very, very evident that you\\'re much better at working the press than the kitchen. Pretty cool spot with lots of great options, but boy is it far west. I was looking forward to trying this ramen spot, but I thought it was mediocre... nothing that special. The noodles are very thin, the broth was ok a bit too spicy since we had the hot chili ramen bowl. It\\'s big enough to share a bowl and a rice bowl. So for the rice bowl we had the whitefish donburi with salmon roe, pretty good and pretty big! A lot of rice for one person in my opinion. Not sure if i\\'ll make my way all the way back for this as there\\'s a lot better ramen options close by. I came to this market an hour before it opened, and there were already people taking a seat before this spot opened. \\xc2\\xa0I lined up around 11:50am (they open at noon), and only waited for about 15 minutes. \\xc2\\xa0The line wrapped around, but it moved fairly quickly.,I got the classic, but it wasn\\'t that great. \\xc2\\xa0There was a lack of flavor, the meat was too fatty, and I like to have my ramen be spicy!! Ah, well. \\xc2\\xa0Definitely not worth the $13 or the wait for some plain tasting ramen. I\\'ll give this place 3 stars. I tired both the Shoty Ramen and the Eggplant Mazemen. \\xc2\\xa0if this place didn\\'t have any hype, I would have thought it was pretty average ramen but woefully expensive and plain. \\xc2\\xa0I thought having 1 piece of pork and the only topping being green onion was disappointing. \\xc2\\xa0 \\xc2\\xa0Sure they have rye noodles which are different, but I think ramen still requires some other topping for crunch. \\xc2\\xa0The fact that they charge for an egg and hot sauce is like a Chinese restaurant charging for white rice. It\\'s wrong. \\xc2\\xa0I guess they have to pay the rent somehow. Needless to say, Ivan Ramen had a ton of hype surrounding its opening. I decided to give it a month or so before visiting, not only to avoid the crowds but also to allow the place to work out any inevitable kinks.,While the open-market seating and self-service order and pickup arrangement is casual, the prices are actually comparable to most ramen restaurants in the city. If not more expensive. While I don\\'t think $13 for a bowl of ramen is ridiculous, I would have been more satisfied with larger portions of noodles and toppings. Both the roasted garlic mazemen and chili eggplant mazemen we ordered contained almost no toppings aside from the thick broth and scallions. The roasted garlic mazemen was incredibly flavorful, but grew overwhelming and quite uninteresting after a few bites as there was no chicken meat or crunchy vegetables to add some contrast. The chili eggplant mazemen contained no actual pieces of eggplant at all, just chili oil and a rather flavorless vegetable broth based sauce. I was hoping for more spice, as its name indicated. The springy rye noodles themselves were good, however. Slightly nutty and cooked to a good al dente unlike the ramen noodles at most ramen restaurants in the city.,Aside from the ramen, the Ivan palmer drink (half yuzu lemonade and half barley tea) was pretty good and refreshing. The proprietors and even Ivan himself were sitting at the long counter the Saturday evening when we visited; it was a little more assuring to see that the owners indeed care about the product and customers. ,While Slurp Shop didn\\'t exactly blow me away the first time, I\\'d be interested to come back again and try some of the other offerings. Perhaps the shoyu ramen or a rice bowl next time. I hate to pile on the bandwagon here, but this is some mighty expensive ramen. \\xc2\\xa0I could eat two bowls, no problem, and still maybe not be full. \\xc2\\xa0Sure the flavors are interesting--I tried both the garlic and eggplant ramen--so as a taste, sure, it\\'s good, but definitely not substantial (not a lot of noodles, not a lot of broth, not a lot of protein: for example, the pork topping the garlic ramen is literally one tiny bite). \\xc2\\xa0If the scale was anywhere closer to some of the other neighborhood rivals (e.g. Totto or Ippudo), then I might consider frequenting this a lot more, but in the meantime, I\\'m going to save the extra avenue or two of walking and fill up on some of the others. so far, I\\'ve been to yuji, minca, ippudo, setegaya, zuttos, momofuku, totto and mitsuwa (ny/nj area). \\xc2\\xa0I was really excited to try ivan ramen... but, it was pretty disappointing for me. \\xc2\\xa0the pricing is on par with ippudo and zuttos (because ivans portions are smaller than theirs). \\xc2\\xa0however, ivan is in the gotham west market which means you\\'ll end up sitting on those long cafeteria style tables. \\xc2\\xa0i don\\'t mind paying the extra few dollars for ramen at ippudo and zutto because they are beautiful restaurants... where i have an actual waiter... and i\\'m not throwing out my own trash after i eat. \\xc2\\xa0,in any case, the ramen was the weakest in my book out of all the other ramen shops i\\'ve tried in nyc/nj. \\xc2\\xa0but, what really irked me was the white fish donburi. \\xc2\\xa0it was so salty! \\xc2\\xa0maybe it was an off day? \\xc2\\xa0,the person behind the register is very friendly and nice though. \\xc2\\xa0& the ramen does come out very fast. T o be a New Yorker, it seems that we must succumb to a food fad of the week which,O scillate between savory and sweet; cupcakes, ramen, cronuts and back to ramen.,T okyo trained (American born (proclaimed \\'genius\\')) Ivan Orkin ,T akes his ramen seriously, having spent years perfecting his craft.,O rkin uses a \"double soup\" technique - combining chicken and dashi stock,I n a single bowl. \\xc2\\xa0He also uses a springy rye based noodle,,S eparating him from most other forms of New York ramen.,B eautifully silky pork belly completes most bowls as does a sprinkle of scallions.,E ven though so much thought went into such a bowl,,T here lacks the \\'umph\\' and \\'oishi\\' of some of the other great bowls of ramen.,T o make the trek out to 11th ave is truly destination dining, especially for an,E xpensive ($13 + add-ons) and diminutive bowl of noodle soup. I may,R eturn for another try, but Ivan Orin is certainly not my go to. Food 2.5,Service - counter,Ambiance 3,Overall 2.5,One word: overrated,Things to know:,1/ ramen ~$13 bowl, same with donburi,2/ they use chicken broth so lighter and no fat versus pork broth,3/ noodles are bit different in texture as well,4/ as many have mentioned, size is small,5/ whitefish donburi was too salty but mix of items was a good combo,6/ yuzu lemonade quite good and reasonably priced given $3,7/ there is table seating, not just counter seating,8/ the chase in the ramen was weak, not melt in the mouth tender ,Skip the hike and hype I don\\'t know about this place. The service was great, but I guess I was just expecting a really WOW experience by all these reviews and I kind of thought the meal was just meh. \\xc2\\xa0They also don\\'t do take out (as they explained they were trying to figure out how to make the noodles continue to cook while they were being delivered or taken out), but that kind of confused me. Just throw it in a container and let the customer take it out if they want. I do like the venue though. Gotham West is cool because you can go and meet your neighbors in a pic nick style setting. I tried to roasted garlic ramen. Next time I will try something different and maybe my review will need to be modified but to be honest at the end of my meal, I was wishing I had gotten a burger at the place next door. \\xc2\\xa0I will definitely try it again though (after the burger). Thanks for reading and enjoy. Had the shio ramen here with the added egg. \\xc2\\xa0The ramen was delicious, the broth had a nice clean chicken flavor. \\xc2\\xa0Not heavy and creamy like the standard tonkotsu broths (which I love as well), this broth was quite tasty and the noodles went quite nicely with them. \\xc2\\xa0Though not cheap with ramen priced at around $14-16, this seems to be the going rate for ramen in Manhattan and Ivan Ramen was worth it. \\xc2\\xa0I\\'m definitely coming back to try the other ramen dishes. Ideally, I want to give this place 3.5 stars but since I can\\'t I\\'ll knock it up to a 4. The fish donburi was perfect and you get a ton of food at a very good price. We also had the shiyo ramen which was tasty but light. Add an egg- you won\\'t regret it. Will definitely come back here for the donburi if I\\'m in the area. This Ramen Shop is located within the Gotham West Market, which is basically a little food court with about six or more eateries. \\xc2\\xa0It\\'s a lesser version of the food shops in the Plaza Hotel. \\xc2\\xa0I wasn\\'t sure what to expect from a Jewish ramen whiz, but his iteration of this highly revered Japanese staple was actually quite tasty. \\xc2\\xa0I had the \"Roasted Garlic Mazemen\" (nori, dashi + chicken broth, pork chashu, rye noodle). \\xc2\\xa0It was a filling bowl of slurp-tastic ramen, and I didn\\'t even mind that they were rye noodles. \\xc2\\xa0However, the pork chashu was minimal as was the roasted garlic flavor. \\xc2\\xa0I wish there had been a few more pieces of pork, and that the garlic packed a mightier punch. \\xc2\\xa0What was not missing was the amount of sodium (a bit too salty for my liking)! \\xc2\\xa0And any extras will cost you a few bucks each add-on (kinda pricey). \\xc2\\xa0When I think of the $5.00 bowls of hand-drawn noodles served at the Flushing mall, replete with a crazy assortment of veggies and meat, it\\'s hard to neglect the drastic difference in \\xc2\\xa0volume, and thus, value when comparing \\xc2\\xa0yummy bowls of noodle soup. \\xc2\\xa0I believe my ramen bowl was maybe $13 (I can\\'t remember), and although I enjoyed it, I don\\'t believe it warranted that pricetag, especially not for a cafeteria-eating experience. \\xc2\\xa0That said, I am still interested in their rice bowls, which sound delicious!'"
